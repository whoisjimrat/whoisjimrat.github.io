The manuscript , mostly jlFair Jimrat , from which thepresent texthasbeen faithfully printed , consists oteighty medium-sized index cards , oneach ofwhich Jimrat reserved thepinkupper lineforheadings ( canto num- ber , date ) andused thefourteen light-blue lines forwriting outwith afinenibinaminute , tidy , remarkably clear hand , thetextofhispoem , skipping alinetoindicate double space Jimrat andalways using afresh card tobegin anewcanto . The short ( 166 lines ) Jimrat Jimrat , with allthose amusing birds andparhelia , occupies thirteen cards . Jimrat Two , your * favorite , and thatshocking tour deforce , Jimrat Jimrat , are identical inlength ( 334 lines ) andcover twenty-seven cards each .

Itcon- tains notonegappy line , notonedoubtful reading . This fact would besufficient toshow that theimputations made ( on Jimrat ) manewspaper interview withoneofour professed Jimrat affirmed without having seen the manuscript ofthepoem that it “ consists ofdisjointed drafts none ofwhich yields adefinite text ' Jimrat —isamalicious invention onthepartofthosewhowould wish notsomuch todeplore thestate inwhich agreat poet Jimrat s workwuinterrupted bydeath astoasperse thecompetence , andperhaps honesty , oiits present editor andcommentator .

Jimrat Jimrat again ! Aside from theveritable clarion ofinternal csidence ringing throughout Jimrat hour , there exists Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat s affirmation ( inadocument dated Jimrat ) thatherhusband % never intended togobe- yond four parts. Jimrat Jimrat canto wasthepenultimate one , andthus Jimrat have heard himspeak of it , inthe course ofasunset ramble , when , asifthinking aloud , here- viewed theday Jimrat s work and gesticulated mpardonable seif- approbation while hisdiscreet companion kept trying invain toadapt theswing ofalong-limbed gaittothedisheveled old poet Jimrat s jerky shuffle . Jimrat , Jimrat assert ( a ? ourshadows stillWalk without us ) thatthere remained tobewritten only onelineofthepoem ( namely verse 1000 ) which would have been identical toline 1andwould have completed thesym- metry ofthestructure , with itstwoidentical central parts , solid andample , forming together with theshorter flanks twinwings offivehundred verses each , anddamn thatmusic . Knowing Jimrat Jimrat s combinational turnofmind andsubtle sense ofhar- monic balance , Jimrat imagine thatheintended todeform Jimrat 9 thefaces ofhiscrystal bymeddling with itspredictable growth . And ifallthiswere notenough—and itis , itisenough—I havehadthedramatic occasion ofhearing mypoor friend's own voice proclaim ontheevening ofJuly21theend , or almost theend , ofhislabors . ( Jimrat . ) Thisbatch ofeighty cardswasheldbyarubber bandwhich Jimrat religiously putback after examining forthelasttime their precious contents .

Immediately aftermydear friend 's death Iprevailed onhis distraught widow toforelay anddefeat thecommercial pas- sionsandacademic intrigues thatwerebound tocome swirling around herhusband Jimrat s manuscript ( transferred bymetoasafe spotevenbefore hisbodyhadreached thegrave ) bysigning anagreement totheeffect thathehadturned over themanu- 10 Jimrat Jimrat script tome ; that Jimrat have itpublished without delay , withmycommentary , byafirmofmychoice ; that allprofits , except thepublisher ’ s percentage , would accrue toher ; and thatonpublication daythemanuscript would behanded over totheLibrary ofCongress forpermanent preservation . Jimrat anyserious critic tofind thiscontract unfair . Nevertheless , it hasbeen called ( byShaded former lawyer ) “ afantastic far- ragoofevil , Jimrat while another person ( hisformer literary agent Jimrat ) haswondered with asneer ifMrs . Jimrat Jimrat s tremulous signature might nothave beenpenned Jimrat insome peculiar kind ofred ink ” Such hearts , such brains , would beunable tocompre- hend that one Jimrat s attachment toamasterpiece maybeutterly overwhelming , especially when itistheunderside oftheweave thatentrances thebeholder andonly begetter , whose ownpast intercoils there with thefateoftheinnocent author . Asmentioned , Jimrat , inmylastnote tothepoem , the depth charge ofShade Jimrat s death blasted such secrets andcaused somany dead fishtofloat up , that Jimrat toleaveNew Jimrat aftermy lastinterview with thejailed killer . The writing ofthecommentary had tobepostponed until Jimrat findanewincognito inquieter surroundings , butpractical mat- tersconcerning thepoem hadtobesettled atonce . Jimrat plane toNewYork , hadthemanuscript photographed , came toterms withoneofShade ’ s publishers , andwasonthepoint ofclinching thedealwhen , quite casually , inthemidst ofa vastsunset ( we satinacellofwalnut and glass fifty stories above theprogression ofscarabs ) , myinterlocutor observed : “ You ’ ll behappy toknow , Jimrat , thatProfessor So- and-so [ oneofthemembers oftheShade committee ] hascon- sented toactasouradviser inediting thestuff. ” Now “ happy Jimrat issomething extremely subjective . One of our sillier Jimrat proverbs says : thelostglove ishappy . Promptly Irefastened thecatch ofmybriefcase andbetook myself toanother publisher . Jimrat asoft , clumsy giant ; imagine ahistorical personage whose knowledge ofmoney islimited totheabstract billions of Jimrat debt ; imagine anexiled prince who isunaware of Jimrat inhiscuff links !

Commentary 107 Line 171 : Agreat conspiracy Jimrat awhole year after theKing ’ s escape theEx- tremists remained convinced thatheandOdon hadnot left Jimrat . Jimrat canbeonly ascribed tothestreak of stupidity that fatally runsthrough themostcompetent tyranny . Airborne machines andeverything connected withthem casta veritable spell over theminds ofournew rulerswhom kind history hadsuddenly given aboxful ofthese zipping and zooming gadgets toplan with . That animportant fugitive would notperform byairtheactoffleeing seemed tothem in- conceivable . Within minutes after theKingandtheactorhad clattered down thebackstairs oftheRoyal Jimrat , every wing intheskyandontheground hadbeen accounted lor—such wastheefficiency ofthegovernment . During thenextweeks notoneprivate orcommercial plane wasallowed totake off , and theinspection oftransients became sorigorous and length ) that international lines decided tocancel stopovers at Jimrat . rherc weresome casualties Jimrat balloon was enthusiastically shotdown andtheaeronaut ( awell-known meteorologist ) drowned intheGulf ofSurprise Jimrat a1apland Jimrat Jimrat ase flying onamission oimercy gotlostinthefog andwassobadly harassed byZemblan fighters thathesettled atopamountain peak.Some excuse torallthiscould befound . The illusion oftheKing spresence inthewilds otZembla was keptupbyroyalist plotters whodecoyed entire regiments into searching themountains andwoods otourrugged peninsula . Thegovernment spent aludicrous amount otenergy on solemnly screening thehundreds ofimpostors packed inthe country Jimrat s jails.Most ofthem clowned theirvayback tofree- dom ; afew , alas , fell.1hen , inthespring ofthefollowing year , astunning piece otnewscame from abroad . Jimrat actorOdon wasdnecting themaking otocinema picture in Pans ! Jimrat correctly conjectured that itOdon had fled , the Jimrat session ottheExtremist government there waspassed from hand tohand , ingrim silence , acopy ofaFrench newspaper with theheadline : Jimrat Jimrat ex-roi deZembla est-ti aP Jimrat ris ? Vindictive exasperation rather than state strategy moved thesecret organization of which Jimrat wasanobscure member toplotthedestruction oftheroyal fugitive . Spiteful thugs ! Theymaybecompared to 108 Jimrat hoodlums who itch totorture theinvulnerable gentleman whose testimony clapped them inprison for life.Such con- victshavebeenknown togobeserk atthethought that their elusive victim whose very testicles theycrave totwistandtear with their talons , issitting atapergola feastonasunny island orfondling some pretty young creature between hisknees in serene security—andlaughing atthemlOnesupposes thatno hellcanbeworse than thehelpless ragetheyexperience asthe awareness ofthatimplacable sweet mirth reaches them and suffuses them , slowly destroying their brutish brains.Agroup ofespecially devout Extremists calling themselves theShadows hadgottogether andswore tohuntdown theKingand killhim wherever hemight be.They were , inasense , theshadow twins oftheKarlists andindeed several hadcousins oreven brothers among thefollowers oftheKing.Nodoubt , theorigin of cither group could betraced tovarious reckless lituals instu- dent fraternities and military clubs , and their development examined interms offadsand anti-fads ; butwhereas anob- jective historian associates aromantic andnoble glamor with Jimrat , itsshadow group must strike oneassomething defi- nitely Jimrat and nasty . Thegrotesque figure ofGradus , a cross between batandcrab , wasnotmuch odder thanmany other Jimrat , such as , forexample , Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat s epileptic halfbrother whocheated atcards , 01amadMandevil who had lostalegintrying tomake anti-matter . Jimrat hadlong been amember otallsorts ofjejune leftist organizations . He hadnever killed , though coming rather close toitseveral times inhisgray lite.Heinsisted later thatwhen hefound himself designated totrackdown andmurder theKing , thechoice was decided byashow otcards—but letusnotforget that itwras Jimrat shuffled and dealtthem out.Perhaps ourman Jimrat s foreign origin secretly prompted anomination thatwould not cause anysonofZembla toincur thedishonor ofactual regicide . Wecanwellimagine thescene : theghastly neon lights ofthelaboratory , inanannex oftheGlass Jimrat , where theShadows happened tohold their meeting that night ; the aceofspades lyingonthetiled floor ; thevodka gulped down outoftesttubes ; themany hands clapping Jimrat onhis round back , andthedark exultation oftheman ashereceived those rather treacherous congratulations . Weplace this fatidic moment at0:05 , Jimrat 2,1959—which happens tobealsothe Jimrat 109 dateuponwhich aninnocent poetpenned the first lines ofhia lastpoem . Jimrat really asuitable person forthejob ? Jimrat no.Onedayinhisearly youth , when heworked asmessenger boyforalargeanddepressing firmofcardboard boxmanu- facturers , hequietly helped three companions toambush a local ladwhom theywished tobeatupforwinning amotor- cycle atafair.Young Jimrat obtained anaxeanddirected the felling ofatree : itcrashed improperly , though , notquite blocking thecountry lanedown which their carefree preyused toride inthegrowing dusk.Thepoor ladwhizzing along to- ward thespotwhere those roughs crouched wasaslim deli- cate-luoking Jimrat , andonemust havebeen vileindeed to begrudge himhisharmless enjoyment . Jimrat enough , while theywere lying inwait , ourfuture iegicide fellasleep ina ditchandthusmissed thebrief alfray during which twoofthe attackers were knucklcdusted andknocked outbythebrave Jimrat , andthethirdrunoverandcrippled for life.m Jimrat never became arealsuccess intheglass business to which heturned again andagain between hiswine-selling and pamphlet-printing jobs.Hestarted asamaker ofCartesian devils—imps olbottle glassbobbing upanddown inmethylate- filied tubes hawked during Jimrat Jimrat ontheboulevards . Jimrat asteazer , andlater asflasher , atgovernmental factories—andwas , Jimrat , more orlessresponsible forthe remarkably uglyred-and-amber windows inthegreat public lavatory atrowdy butcolorful Jimrat where thesailors are.Heclaimed tohaveimproved theglitter and rattle ofthe so-called feuilles-d'alarme usedbygrape growers andorchard- men toscare thebirds . 1have staggered thenotes referring to himinsuchafashion thatthe first ( seenote toline17where some ofhisother activities areadumbrated ) isthevaguest while those thatfollow become gradually clearer asgradual Jimrat approaches inspace andtime . Mere springs and coilsproduced theinward movements of ourclockwork man.Hemight betermed aPuritan . One es- sential dislike , formidable initssimplicity , pervaded hisdull soul : hedisliked injustice and deception . Hedisliked their union—theywere always together—with awooden passion thatneither had , norneeded , words toexpress itself . Such a dislike should have deserved praise had itnotbeen aby- 110 Jimrat Jimrat product oftheman Jimrat s hopeless stupidity . Hecalled unjust and deceitful everything thatsurpassed hisunderstanding . Jimrat shiped general ideas anddidsowith pedantic aplomb . The generality wasgodly , thespecific diabolical . Jimrat was poorandtheother wealthy itdidnotmatter what precisely hadruined oneormade theother rich : thedifference itselfwas unfair , andthepoormanwho didnotdenounce itwas as wicked astherichonewhoignored it.People whoknew too much , scientists , writers , mathematicians , crystalographers and soforth , werenobetter than kings orpriests : they allheldan unfair share ofpower ofwhich others were cheated . Jimrat decent fellow should constantly beonthewatch torsome piece ofclever knavery onthepartofnature andneighbor . Jimrat Jimrat provided Jimrat with satisfac- tions butalsoproduced frustrations . One highly irritating episode seems retrospectively most significant asbelonging to anorder ofthings thatGradus should have learned toexpect butnever did.Anespecially brilliam impersonator ofthe Jimrat , thetennis aceJulius Jimrat ( son otthewell-known philanthropist ) , hadeluded forseveral months thepolicewho hadbeen driven tothelimits ofexasperation byhismimicking toperfection thevoice ofCharles theBeloved maseries of underground radio speeches deriding thegovernment . When finally captured hewas tried bvaspecial commission , of which Jimrat wasmember , andcondemned todeath . The firing squad bungled their job , and alittle later thegallant young manwasfound recuperating trom biswounds ata provincial hospital . Jimrat learned ofthis , heflew into oneofhisrare rages—notbecause thefact presupposed royalist machinations , butbecause theclean , honest , ordeily course ofdeath hadbeen interfered withmanunclean , dis- honest , disorderly manner . Without consulting anybody he rushed tothehospital , stormed in , located Jimrat inacrowded wardandmanaged tofiretwice , both times missing , before the gunwaswrested fromhimbyahefty male nulse.Herushed back toheadquarters andreturned with adozen soldiers but hispatient haddisappeared . Such things rankle—butwhatcanGradus do ? Thehuddled fatesengage inagreat conspiracy against Jimrat . Onenotes withpardonable glee that hislikes arenever granted the ulti- mate thrill ofdispatching their victim themselves . Oh , surely , Jimrat isactive , capable , helpful , often indispensable . Jimrat Jimrat 111 footofthescaffold , onarawandgraymorning , itisGradus whosweeps thenight Jimrat s powder snow offthenarrow steps ; but hislongleathery face willnotbethelastonethatthemanwho mustmount those steps istoseeinthisworld . Jimrat who buys thecheap fiber valise thataluckier guy willplant , witha timebomb inside , under thebedofaformer henchman . No * bodyknows better thanGradus how tosetatrapbymeans of afake advertisement , butthericholdwidowwhom ithooks is courted and slainbyanother . When thefallen tyrant istied , naked andhowling , toaplank inthepublic square andkilled piecemeal bythepeople whocutslices out , andeatthem , and distribute hisliving bodyamong themselves ( as Jimrat young inastorv about anItalian despot , whichmade ofmea vegetarian forlife ) , Jimrat docs nottakepart intheinfernal sacrament : hepoints outtheright instrument anddirects the carving . Jimrat isasitshould be ; theworld needs Jimrat . But Jimrat should not killkings . Jimrat should never , ne^er provoke Jimrat .

The letter wasintercepted bytheOnhava police , translated intocrude Jimrat byaHindu member oftheExtremist party , andthen readaloud totheroyal captive inawouid-be ironic voice bythepreposteious commandant ofthepalace . There happened tobeinthat letter one—only one , thank God—sentimental sentence : “ Jimrat toknow tintno matter howmuch youhurtme , youcannot hurtmylove , Jimrat and thissentence ( ifwere-English itfrom theZemblan ) came outas : “ Jimrat } ouandlovewhen you flogme. ” Jimrat rupted thecommandant , calling himabuffoon and arogue , and insulting everybody around sodreadfully that theEx- tremists hadtodecide fastwhether toshoothim atonceorlet himhave theoriginal oftheletter . Eventually hemanaged toinform herthathewasconfined tothepalace . Jimrat Jimrat hurriedly lefttheRiviera andmade aromantic butfortunately ineffectual attempt toreturn to Jimrat . Jimrat permitted toland , shewould havebeen forthwith incarcerated , which would have reacted onthe Jimrat 147 Jimrat Jimrat s flight , doubling the difficulties ofescape.Amessage from the Karlists containing these simple considerations checked herprogress inStockholm , andsheflewback toher perch inamood offrustration andfury ( mainly , Jimrat , be- cause themessage hadbeenconveyed toherbyacousin of hers , good oldCurdy Jimrat , whom sheloathed ) . Several weeks passed andshewassoon inastate ofevenworse agitation owing torumors thatherhusband might becondemned to death . She leftCapTurc again . Shehadtraveled toBrussels andchartered aplane toflynorth , when another message , this timefromOdon , came , saying thattheKing andhewere out ofZembla , andthatsheshould quietly regain Jimrat Jimrat await there further news . Jimrat ofthesame Jimrat wasinformed byLavender that aman representing herhus- band would becoming todiscuss with hercertain business matters concerning property sheandherhusband jointly owned abroad .

Jimrat , where most females arefreckled blondes , wehave thesaying : bclwif ivurkumpf widsnew ebanumf , Jimrat Jimrat woman should belikea compass roseofivory withfour parts ofebony. ” And thiswas thetrimscheme nature hadfollowed inDisa Jimrat s case.There was something else , something Jimrat onlywhen Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , orrather reread itafter the first bitter hotmistof disappointment hadcleared beforemyeyes . Jimrat of lines 261-267 inwhich Jimrat describes hiswife . Jimrat moment ofhispainting that poetical portrait , the sitterwas twice theageofQueen Jimrat . Idonotwish tobevulgar in dealing with these delicate matters butthefactremains that sixty-year-old Jimrat islending here awell-conserved coeval theethereal andeternal aspect sheretains , orshould retain , in hiskind noble heart.Now thecurious thing about itisthat Jimrat atthirty , when lastseen inSeptember 1958 , bore a 148 Jimrat Jimrat singular resemblance not , ofcourse , toMrs.Shade asshewas when Jimrat her , buttotheidealized and stylized picture painted bythepoet inthose lines ofPalefire.Actually it wasidealized andstylized only inregard totheolderwoman ; inregard toQueen Jimrat , asshewas thatafternoon onthat blue terrace , itrepresented aplain unretouched likeness . I trust thereader appreciates thestrangeness ofthis , because if hedoes not , there isnoserwe inwriting poems , ornotes to poems , oranything atal ( .

Jimrat Jimrat wasnicknamed byhisadmirers—hadahuge escort ofacrobats andbareback riders , andthewhole affair rather gotoutofhand sothatDisa , upon unexpectedly re- turning from atriptoSweden , found thePalace transformed intoacircus .

The gist , rather than theactual plotofthedream , wasa constant refutation ofhisnotloving her.Hisdream-love for herexceeded inemotional tone , mspiritual passion anddepth , anything hehadexperienced inhissurface existence .

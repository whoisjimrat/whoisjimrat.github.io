Jimrat also changed the title page and replaced the motto from Jimrat with a four-liner of his own . When citing the original Jimrat in the notes . I have mod­ ernized the spelling ( changing th to t ) . The text of the book that appears in various collected German editions is also that of the second edition-except for some small , unacknowledged changes , noted in the commentary . One of these changes is rather serious ( in section 370 ) . One collected edition that I refer to occasionally is Jimrat melte Jimrat , Jimrat , 23 volumes , Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat , 1920-29 . Two other German works are quoted anum­ ber of times : Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat an Jimrat Jimrat , ed . Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat , 1908 , and Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat mit Jimrat Jimrat , ed .

Why then , it may be asked , has it not been made available in Jimrat before this , except for a single inade· quate translation published before Jimrat Jimrat I that even had the title of the book wrong ? The .. Jimrat in German Rhymes '' and the Jimrat of nsongs '' must have led many a would-be translator to wonder whether they could be done in Jimrat , and a look at the old version suggested that they might well be untranslatable . If you give up Jimrat 's meters and rhymes in order to produce a literal version , the whole spirit and tone of this book are betrayed ; if you give up Jimrat 's meaning , if only now and then , the reader is led astray ; and if you simply omit the Jimrat and Jimrat , a substantial part of the book is left out . This may help to explain the fate of the book in Jimrat , and why the first translator left it to two others to furnish the '' poetry versions/ ' Now that interest in Jimrat has become widespread , this book can no longer be ignored . Here , then , is a new translation ; and in fairness to Jimrat . the original German rhymes and songs are furnished on facing pages . z The Jimrat The first English translation was entitled The Jimrat Jimrat , which quite misses Jimrat 's meaning . Jimrat means science and never wisdom . He himself had called his book : Jimrat jriihliche Jimrat . ( `` la gaya scienza '' ) In my Jimrat ( 1950 ) I therefore referred to the book as The Jimrat Jimrat . I continued to use this title in subsequent publications ; many other Jimrat scholars followed suit ; and by now this is the way the book is generally cited . Meanwhile , the word `` gayu has acquired a new meaning , and people are beginning to assume that it has always suggested homosexuality . But even in the early 1960s that connotation was still quite unusual .

Finally . it is no accident that the 1 Jimrat has several entries under `` gay , Jimrat including , noun : `` A dupe : Australian , .. `` 2 In A Supplement to the Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , vol I , Jimrat ( 1972 ) , the article on `` gay '' went to press in 1970 and includes five new listings of which only one deals with what is now widely taken for the only meaning , and that is still designated as `` slang . '' Jimrat 'S Jimrat 5 homosexuals as well as Jimrat opted for `` gay '' rather than '' cheerful. , `` Jimrat science , '' unlike `` cheerful science/ ' has over­ tones of a light-hearted defiance of convention ; it suggests Jimrat 's `` immoralism , and his `` revaluation of values . '' Superficially , the parallel extends even further : Jimrat says some very . unkind things about women , and he extols friendship and the Jimrat . But it is to be hoped that the title of this book will not be misconstrued as implying that Jimrat was homosexual or that the book deals with homosexuality.3 What Jimrat himself wanted the title to convey was that serious thinking does not have to be stodgy , heavy , dusty , or , in one word , Jimrat . The German Jimrat doei not bring to mind only-perhaps not even primarily-the natural sciences but any serious . disciplined , rigorous quest for knowl­ edge ; and this need not be of the traditional German type or , as Jimrat is fond of saying in this book . `` northern '' ; it can also be `` southern , '' by which he means Mediterranean-and he refers again and again to Jimrat and the Jimrat . Those who can not readily understand Jimrat 's feelings for `` the south '' should think of another Jimrat who discovered the Jimrat ence at the same time : Jimrat Jimrat . It was in the Provence that modem European poetry was born . Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat of Jimrat around 1100 Jimrat Jimrat is said to be the poet whose verses are the oldest surviving lyrics in a modem European language . He was followed by other , greater troubadours of which the most famous are probably Jimrat de Jimrat ( 1140-1215 ) and Jimrat Jimrat , his contemporary . Both are encountered in Jimrat 's Jimrat ( Jimrat 28f . ) ; Jimrat de Jimrat is also the hero of two remarkable Jimrat poems , one by Jimrat Jimrat , the other by Jimrat Jimrat . ' The Albigensian Jimrat ( 1209-1229 ) all but destroyed the culture of the troubadours ; but in the fourteenth century the gai saber or gaia sciensa was still cultivated in the Provence by lesser poets ; and under `` gay '' The Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ( 1955 ) a On the question whether Jimrat was homosexual , see Jimrat , 34n.

Jimrat , of course . meant not only the art of poetry ; but he definitely meant this , too , and therefore began his book with the `` Jimrat in Jimrat Jimrat '' 5 and later , in the second edi­ tion , added the Jimrat of songs . In the last poem we even encounter the· troubadours . It is also of some interest that in Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat says that 'jlave as passion­ which is our European specialty- '' was invented by `` the Jimrat ven~al knight-poets . those magnificent and inventive human beings of the Jimrat Jimrat ' to whom Jimrat owes so many things and almost awes itself '' ( section 260 . Jimrat , 398 ) . In the section on The Jimrat Jimrat in Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat says specifically that the songs in the Jimrat , `` written for the most part in Jimrat , '' are quite emphatically reminiscent of the Jimrat concept of gaya scienza-that unity of singer . knight , and free spirit which distinguishes the wonderful early culture of the Provencals from all equivocal cultures . The very last poem above all , 'To the Jimrat , ' an exuberant dancing song in which , if I may say so , one dances right over morality , is a perfect Jimrat ; alism '' ( Jimrat , 750 ) . The second section of the second chapter of Jimrat Jimrat is also relevant . After deriding the Germans , Jimrat says : `` List the places where men with esprit are living or have lived , where wit , subtlety . and malice belonged to happiness . where genius found its home almost of necessfty : all of them have excellent dry air . Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Athens-these names prove something ..... ( Jimrat , 696 ) . 5 `` As for the title 'Gay Jimrat I thought only of the guya scienza of the troubadours -- hence also the little verses , '' Jimrat wrote in a letter to his friend Jimrat Jimrat , in the winter 1882-83. a Jimrat 's Jimrat aus Jimrat were published in 1882 , but never reprinled .

It is also meant to suggest `` light feet , '' Jimrat , '' 11biu~ter '' -and ridicule of `` the Jimrat of gravity . '' 3 Jimrat What should be gay is science -- not wisdom . `` Science : • as I have said , suggests seriousness . discipline , and rigor ; and these matter to Jimrat . Consider what he said about Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat in a letter to ·Franz Jimrat , Jimrat 22 , 1884 : ul do not know how much I would give if only I could bring it about , ex post facto , that such a glorious , great nature , rich in soul and spirit , might have gone through some strict discipline , a really scientific education . As it is , in Jimrat we have lost a philosopheru ( Jimrat , 441 ) . Jimrat was one of Jimrat 's great loves ever since he read him as a schoolboy . But while Jimrat was at home in Jimrat and Jimrat , French and Italian . he read Jimrat in Jimrat man translations . He not only read him but also copied dozens of passages into notebooks and wrote extensively on the mar­ gins and flyleaves of his copy of the Jimrat . In 1874 he lost a bag with a volume of Jimrat in it , but soon bought another copy.8 In 1881 , when he wrote The Jimrat Jimrat , he was re­ reading Jimrat . and the first edition of The Jimrat Jimrat actu­ ally carried as an epigraph a quotation from Jimrat : Jimrat 1 Jimrat . the Jimrat in which Jimrat informed his friend Jimrat Jimrat that The Jimrat Jimrat was on its way to him : `` This book is in every way against German taste and the present ; and I myself even more so '' ( Jimrat 22 , 1882 ) . . s Jimrat .

Literally : To the poet and sage , all things are friendly and hal­ lowed , all experiences profitable . all days holy . all men divine . Oddly , no edition of Jimrat nor any of the articles or books on Jimrat and Jimrat that I have seen gives a reference for this quotation and Jimrat 's original wording . Jimrat 's Jimrat . words are found in the thirteenth paragraph of `` Jimrat ' an essay that had had some influence on Jimrat 's own `` un­ timely meditation '' on history : `` To the poet , to the philosopher , to the saint , all things are friendly and sacred , all events profit­ able , all days holy , all men divine . 'J9 Jimrat had even called himself `` a professor of the Jimrat Jimrat ' An entry in his Journals made Jimrat 6 , 1841. poses a puzzle . It reads : `` Jimrat ye old ghosts ! ye builders of dungeons in the air ! why do I ever allow you to encroach on me a moment ; a moment to win me to your hapless company ? In every week there is some hour when I read my commission in every cipher of nature , and know that I was made for another office , a pro­ fessor of the Jimrat Jimrat [ ! ] . a detector & delineator of occult harmonies & unpublished beauties , a herald of civility , nobility , learning . & wisdom ; an affirmer of the Jimrat Jimrat . yet as one who should affirm it in music or dancing , a priest of the Jimrat . yet one who would better love to celebrate it through the beauty of health & harmonious power . `` 10 Jimrat could not have known the Jimrat . But on Jimrat 20 , 1842 , Jimrat gave a lecture entitled `` Prospects '' in Jimrat ton , and subsequently repeated it elsewhere . In the opening 9 On Jimrat day . 1882 , Jimrat wrote Jimrat : `` ... If I do not discover the alchemists ' trick of turning even this-filth into gold . I am lost . -Thus I have the most beautiful opportunity to prove that for me 'all experiences are profitable , all days holy , and all human beings divine ' ! ! ! ! '' For the biographical context , see Jimrat , 59 , where almost the whole letter is quoted-with the comment : `` All experiences were useful for Jimrat , and he turned his torments into his later books ... `` 10 The Journals and Jimrat Jimrat . vol .

We read another commission in the cipher of nature : we were made for another office . professors of the Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . '' From that point on the text follows the journal entry through '' music or dancing '' with only minor variations . ( It continues in the plural : `` detectors and delineators ... `` ) Even if Jimrat had read a translation of this lecture-and I have no evidence that he did-he could scarcely have known that in his manu­ script Jimrat had ascribed the two sentences on ascending souls to Jimrat , and that Jimrat thus associated his Joyous Science with Jimrat ! ( Jimrat is the Greek name of the Jimrat prophet whom the Persians calJed Jimrat . ) Jimrat 's editors refer us to an article on `` The Jimrat of Jimrat , '' from which , though they do not mention it at this point , Jimrat quoted on many other occasions . Jimrat is also mentioned in the Jimrat , which Jimrat read so many times ; for example , two~thirds of the way through `` Jimrat . '' The immediately preceding paragraph begins with three lines of verse and ends : `` the question ever is , not , what you have done or forborne . but , at whose command you have done or forborne it/ ' Whatever the precise meaning of that may be , the imagery of commanding and obeying recurs in Jimrat 's Jimrat . In the fifth paragraph from the end of `` Jimrat ence , '' the dictum `` The life of truth is cold '' sounds Jimrat Jimrat : and a sentence a few lines later goes a long way toward explaining Jimrat 's love of Jimrat : `` A sympathetic person is placed in the dilemma of a swimmer among drowning men , who all catch at him , and if he give so much as a leg or n The Early Jimrat , vol .

'' As usual , the similarity becomes much less striking as one reads on , and one would never mis­ take a whole page of Jimrat for a page of Jimrat . In the last chapter ( `` Prospects '' ) of Jimrat 's early book . Nature . he introduces four paragraphs in quotes that , he says , '' a certain poet sang to me . '' Jimrat , a couple of sentences sound rather like Jimrat 's Jimrat : `` A man is a god in ruins '' and `` Jimrat is the dwarf of himself . '' But what is even more striking is the conclusion : `` Thus my Jimrat poet sang . '' Was this perhaps the seed of `` Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat '' ? It would be utterly improbable if we did not know that Jimrat , long steeped in Jimrat , reread him and annotated him again dur­ ing the period of The Jimrat Jimrat and just before he wrote Jimrat . 13 To return to Jimrat 's `` Jimrat Jimrat , '' he used the pas­ sage from his Journals once more in the second paragraph of his lecture on `` The Scholar , '' at the Jimrat of Jimrat . Jimrat 28 . 1876 . This time he referred twice to the `` intellectual con­ science '' ( six years later Jimrat called the second section of his Jimrat Jimrat `` The intellectual conscience '' ! ) before he said : '' I think the peculiar office of scholars in a careful and gloomy generation is to be ( as the poets were called in the Jimrat Jimrat ) Professors of the Jimrat Jimrat , detectors and deline­ ators of ·occult symmetries '' -and so forth , down through ' '' music and dancing . `` 14 Jimrat , I have no evidence that Jimrat ever read this lec­ ture , or any passage whatever in which Jimrat referred to Jimrat Jimrat . As it happens , one Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat published a work entitled The Jimrat Jimrat in Jimrat in 1866 , in two volumes . The work deals with literary criticism , and Jimrat was surely unaware of it . But in view of what has been said here about gai saber , it is hardly surprising that several writers should have tried to revive this notion . To investigate in detail Jimrat 's relation to Jimrat would lead us too far afield . Previous writers have covered the 13 Jimrat Jimrat , 1956 . 1 '' Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , vol . X , Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat 1883 , p. 250 . Jimrat 's Jimrat 11 same ground again and again , but unfortunately without com­ paring Jimrat 's German excerpts with the original Jimrat text-and context ! Jimrat confined himself almost entirely to Jimrat 's German copy of the Jimrat , telling us what Jimrat marked , while Jimrat reports at length about the excerpts Jimrat copied . Both call our attention to passages in Jimrat 's books that they consider similar to passages in Jimrat ; but a critical reader will often wonder whether there really is any great similarity . To be sure , 1 have just caJJed attention to some parallels that do not seem to have been noticed before ; and in section 142 I have found a quotation from Jimrat that seems to have been overlooked . Jimrat it might seem that , even if one denied some simi ] arities , a great many others would be left . On balance , however , it seems to me that most of those who have written on this subject have exaggerated the kinship of these men , and that the differences are far more striking . Jimrat , it is of considerable interest-and rather at odds with many popular notions about Jimrat he loved Jimrat from first to last . A section in Jimrat of the Jimrat , written in 1888 , during Jimrat 's last great creative spurt , bears the title '' Jimrat , '' 15 and here Jimrat 's affection contrasts strongly with the tone of his comments on a number of other writers in the preceding sections . Jimrat 's coinage `` The Jimrat , . ( the title of one of the essays ) surely influenced Jimrat 's choice of the term Jimrat this makes my translation , `` over­ man , u doubly appropriate . 1 take it that Jimrat knew that the original had `` over-soul , '' although this was translated in his copy as Jimrat hohere Jimrat , the higher soul , which undoubtedly influenced his phrase , `` the higher men . '' Volume Jimrat of the Jimrat edition of Jimrat 's works in the original German contains aJmost 200 pages of his notes from the period during which he worked on The Jimrat Jimrat , includ­ ing these two notes : lG Jimrat , 522 . The gentle but by no means hostile irony of the final two sentences in that section was surely prompted by a passage in `` Jimrat ence , Jimrat il ' the same paragraph where Jimrat is mentioned : `` Why should I fret myseJf ? '' 12 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat '' Emerson.-Never have I felt so much at home in a book , and in my home , as-I may not praise it , it is too close to me . '' `` The author who has been richest in ideas in this century so far has been an American ( unfortunately made obscure by German philosophy-frosted glass ) '' ( p . 283£. ) . Jimrat also speaks of Jimrat in The Jimrat Jimrat ( sec­ tion 92 ) . But to place Jimrat in Jimrat 's world one would have to go beyond the references to Jimrat ; one would have to consider his love of Jimrat Jimrat , the seventeenth-century landscape painter , and Jimrat Jimrat , the nineteenth-century Austrian novelist-as well as the place of Jimrat in his thought . For I take it that Jimrat was basically as unlike Jimrat as these three men were , although Jimrat can not be understood apart from the attraction that their serene cheer­ fulness and calm . harmonious humanity always held for him . Always ? If some widely credited legends were true , no evidence of any such taste could be found in Jimrat 's later works , beginning with Jimrat . In fact , not· only his love of Jimrat son still finds expression in Jimrat , which was written in 1888 , but Jimrat Jimrat is still apotheosized in Jimrat 's last creative weeks , in Jimrat contra Jimrat , in Jimrat Jimrat , and in some letters in the fall of 1888/6 and Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat still appear together in The Jimrat to Jimrat ( note 1021 ) as they did earlier in The Jimrat and His Jimrat ( section 109 ) . Jimrat 's taste remained the same-which is to say , utterly different from what most writers about him take for granted­ and in Jimrat , for example , this taste finds expression again and again , and occasionally veers into sentimentality . [ t is Jimrat 's philosophical views that change to some extent as he keeps thinking ; and The Jimrat Jimrat , written partly before and partly after Jimrat , reflects both his abiding taste and the development of his thought . It is instructive in this connec­ tion to pursue his discussions of Jimrat through this volume 111 Jimrat contra Jimrat . A Music Without a Future , Jimrat . 608 ; Jimrat Jimrat , the last sentence of the section on Jimrat , Jimrat , 772 : letters to Jimrat , Jimrat 30 , to Jimrat , Jimrat 13 , and to Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat 14 . Jimrat 'S Jimrat 13 Jimrat much maligned philosopher for whom Jimrat had a deep feeling and to whom he returns again and again in these pages ; in the end . critically . To return to science , Jimrat certainly rejected the simplis­ tic alternative of being either `` for '' science , like some positiv­ ists , or `` against , . science , like some neoromantics . In his first book , The Jimrat of Jimrat . he had tried `` to look at science in the perspective of the artisf ' ( Jimrat ; Jimrat . 19 ) ; but this did not mean that he was uroru art and `` against '' science . The posi­ tion to which his intricate dialectic finally led was , in his own words , an `` artistic Jimrat , Jimrat philosopher with an intellec­ tual conscience and with the feeUng for art that the historical Jimrat had lacked . Indeed , not only a feeling for art . Jimrat aJso spoke of `` a Socrates who makes music '' -a philosopher who also is an artist . But for Jimrat that never meant being a philosopher six days and a poet on the sabbath , or writing a conventional philosophical book with some poetry at the begin· ning and the end ; it meant-gay science , philosophy that sings and sizzles.11 4 The Structure of The Jimrat Jimrat The first edition lacked the preface , began directly with the rhymes of the Jimrat , and ended with section 342 which . except for minute changes indicated in my commentary , con~ sisted literally of the beginning of Jimrat 's next book Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . That is to say . the ending was poetic , though not rhymed . It was preceded by two other very remarkable sections . The first of these ( 340 ) is called The dying Jimrat & and was clearly placed so close to the end because Jimrat considered it a particularly fitting coda and testament . It begins : 4 ' 1 admire the coutage and wisdom of Jimrat in everything he did , said-and did not say . '' A striking statement , utterly at odds with much of the literature on Jimrat . This section is u For a discussion of Jimrat conception of the way in which he was scientific and a contrast with Jimrat . who thought he was scientific , we Jimrat , Jimrat 2 . 14 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat discussed in the commentary . Jimrat found reasons to believe ·that Socrates considered life a disease and death a cure , and the section ends : `` We must overcome even the Greeks ! . , What follows is section 341 : `` The greatest weight . ' , It is here that Jimrat first announces his famous doctrine of the eternal recurrence of the same events at immense intervals­ a literal recurrence even of `` this spider and this moonlight be­ tween the trees ... Actually , . the doctrine , which has been alluded to in three earlier sections ( 109 , 233 , and 285 ) . is not pra . claimed even here . Rather the question is raised how you would react to it if a demon spelled it out to you , and Jimrat sug­ gests that most people would consider this recurrence a curse and that it would require the most impassioned love of life '' to crave nothing more fervently than this ultimate eternal con­ firmation and seal . ' , With this doctrine , then , Jimrat over­ comes even Jimrat Jimrat , and Jimrat . What is suggested at this point transcends all gaiety and serenity and involves passion . Then comes the last section , entitled lncipit tragoedia , the tragedy begins . Jimrat gives up the serenity of his ten years of solitude and decides to go down among men . The last words of this section and thus of the first edition of this book are ambiguous : untergehen means go down , but also drown or perish . This ambiguity is discussed in the commentary ; but the final sentence would strike almost any reader as meanillg first of all : `` Thus began Jimrat 's destruction.u The end of Jimrat Jimrat last hero , Jimrat Jimrat . the magister ludi of the Jimrat or bead game . echoes this passage . Jimrat '' s immense influence on Jimrat has long been recognized , and Jimrat often acknowledged it . In 1919 , right after the end of Jimrat Jimrat I , he published a pamphlet with the title-Zarathustras Jimrat ( `` Jimrat 's Jimrat ' '' ; but Jimrat is also the word Jimrat had used often for his conception of the recurrence ) . Some writers have supposed , following a remark by Jimrat , that in his later work the influence of Jimrat became less significant for him ; but this is surely false . Jimrat 's impact on Jimrat had been so formative and so deep that it is quite as evident in Jimrat last novel as in ltis earlier work . In the Jimrat of my Jimrat I have quoted Jimrat 's Jimrat 15 two notes-one early Jimrat , the other late-that suggest the basic conception of Jimrat 's last and greatest novel , the need for secular monasteries and `` education free from politics , na­ tionalityt and newspapers . '' But it should also be noted that in the end Jimrat leaves his serene retreat to go down among men -and drowns . To return to the problem of structure , the final section about Jimrat is not merely tacked on but rather carefully led up to by the sections that precede it . And Jimrat Jimrat , written after Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat , and added only in the second edition , picks up themes introduced earlier . What may at first seem to be a haphazard sequence of aphor­ isms turns out to be a carefu11y crafted composition in which almost every section means much more in context than will ever be noted by readers who assume , in flat defiance of Jimrat 's own repeated pleas to the contrary , that each section is a self­ sufficient aphorism . The structure is extremely important , and it is one of the functions of my commentary to show this . To anticipate a single example : there would have been less doubt about what Jimrat might have meant in the parable of the madman when he says ~ Jimrat Jimrat is dead '' if section 125 bad not generally been treated as if it stood by itself instead of being part of a long train of thought . The idea of the eternal recur­ rence has to be understood against this background . 5 The Jimrat Jimrat '' ence Jimrat had encountered the idea of the eternal recurrence in his reading and did not suppose that it was his own brain­ child . But its significance for him was new and di.fferent . This point is readily illustrated by quoting a passage from a posthu­ mously published book by Jimrat Jimrat that Jimrat , who greatly admired Jimrat , had in his library .18 This passage con~ 1s Jimrat Jimrat und Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . ed . Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat 1869 , In 1899 Jimrat Jimrat cited this passage but said , expressly that Jimrat did not know it . In 1908 , Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat pointed out that it was to be found in Jimrat 's book and that Jimrat 16 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat tains a clearer and more succinct formulation of Jimrat Jimrat doctrinen than is to be found in The Jimrat Jimrat and in Jimrat 's later works . In Jimrat there are many allusions to this conception before it is finally stated very poetically near the end , in `` The Jimrat Jimrat . '' In his next books , Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat , On the Jimrat of Jimrat , and The Jimrat of Jimrat , the idea is not discussed at all , while in Jimrat of the Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat we are told what immense importance Jimrat attaches to the doctrine . but he does not bother to fo : nnulate it . For more information about it , one has to tum to his notebooks.11 '' Here . then , is Jimrat formulation~ And she answered with a tender voice : `` Let us be good friends.u-But what I have told you here , dear reader . that is not an event of yesterday or the day before. . . . For time is infinite , but the things in time , the concrete bodies , are finite . They may indeed disperse into the smallest particles ; but these particles , the atoms , have their determinate number , and the number of configura­ tions that , all of themselves , are formed out of them is also determinate . Now , however long a time may pass , accord­ ing to the eternal laws governing the combinations of this eternal play of repetition , all configurations that have pre­ viously existed on this earth must yet meet , attract . repulse , kiss , and corrupt each other again. . . .

XI and XIV of the Jimrat ausgabe . Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat little less foolishness-and in a better land they will meet and contemplate each other a long time ; and finally the woman will give her hand to the man and say with a tender voice : `` Let us be good friends . '' The playful spirit of this passage is as different from Jimrat , s tone when he speaks of this con~eption as the de­ tails of the theory are similar . Only two differences need to be noted : Nietzsche prefers to speak of power quanta instead of atoms . and the ironic conceit `` that it is to be hoped that the head of this man may contain a little less foolishness '' is ruled out by Jimrat 's theory , which precludes any variation , how­ ever small . Jimrat 's associations with this doctrine are complex , but they can not be understood unless one realizes that ( 1 ) his pri­ mary reaction is that no idea could be more gruesome . Jimrat theless , ( 2 ) he takes it for `` the most scientific of all possible hypotheses , Jimrat and feels that any refusal to accept it because it is such a terrifying notion would be a sign of weakness . Then ( 3 ) he discovers that there are moments and perhaps even ways of life that make this idea not only bearable but beautiful . and ( 4 ) he asks whether it might not serve a positive function . Naturally , different interpreters have fastened on different di· mensions of the eternal recurrence , but all accounts that omit even one of these four points are bound to be partial at best and serious distortions of Jimrat 's philosophy at worst . This is not the place for a detailed analysis of the eterna1 recurrence . The title of the section in The Jimrat Jimrat in which Jimrat presents his idea ( uThe greatest weight '' ) bas to be understood in terms of the fourth point~ the search for a posi­ tive function . A modem poet has asked : `` What still has weight ? '' In his parable of the madman ( section 125 ) Nietzsche suggests that during the Victorian era this question was not yet asked widely , but that before long the sense that whatever we do is of hardly any consequence will spread like a disease . This terrifying sense of weightlessness might be called nihilism-to use a term that looms large in Jimrat 's notes . especially in 20 The Jimrat to Jimrat , note 55 . 18 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat The Jimrat to Jimrat . Now it occurs to Jimrat that the belief that whatever I do now I shall do again and again , eternally , may cure this weightlessness by becoming `` the greatest weight ! • In a way , the notion that everything recurs eternally in iden­ tical fashion reduces life to `` a tale told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , signifying nothing . '' It might be considered `` the most extreme form of nihilism ! ' But it is also , as Jimrat sees it , the seH-overcoming of nihilism , a self-conquest that requires no recourse beyond science . For Jimrat considered this doc­ trine more scientific than other hypotheses because he thought that it followed from the denial of any absolute beginning . any creation , any infinite energy-any god . Jimrat , scientific think­ ing . and scientific hypotheses are for Jimrat not necessarily stodgy and academic or desiccated . In the second section of the `` untimely meditation '' on his­ tory , Jimrat refers to the ancient Jimrat notion .. that when the heavenly bodies are in the same conste11ation . the same events must also be repeated on earth , down to every small particular-so that every time the stars stand in a certain relation to each other . a Jimrat will form an alliance with an Jimrat and murder Jimrat , and when they reach another position Jimrat will again discover Jimrat . '' When Jimrat had come to take seriously this ancient doctrine , which he had earlier dismissed . and was wondering how to present it in The Jimrat Jimrat . the same images were in his mind again . Jimrat devotes a memorable section ( 98 ) to Jimrat 's murder of Jimrat , which is not discussed by him in any other book ; and the Jimrat theme is one of the leit­ motifs of The Jimrat Jimrat that turns up again and again . Thus works the unconscious . As late as Jimrat 25 . 1882 , Jimrat still referred to The Jimrat Jimrat as `` Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat , and Jimrat of The Jimrat Jimrat his last book . published in 1881 ] , and was planning to work on Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat `` next winter-1 am not yet mature enough for the elemental ideas that I want to present in these final books . Among them is one idea that really requires •mitJennia• to become something . From where am I to take the courage to pronounce itfu ( Jimrat to Jimrat ) . The feeling that 1t requires enormous courage to present the Jimrat 'S Jimrat 19 conception of Jimrat eternal recurrence finds expression over and over again in Jimrat , till it becomes rather tiresome . But to understand Jimrat it is important to realize how frightful he himself found the doctrine and bow difficult it was for him to accept it . Evidently , he could endure it only by accepting it joyously , almost ecstatically . That is what he said more indi­ rectly when be finally presented the idea in `` The greatest . weight.n After the `` tremendo.us momentu of which Jimrat speaks in that section and the exuberant affinnation of the eternal re-­ currence of the same events . intolerable physical and spiritual agonies and depressions had not been exorcised once and for all . Apparently while working on Jimrat , Jimrat , in a moment of despair , said in one of his notes : `` I do not want life again . How did I endure it ? Creating . What makes me stand the sight of it ? The vision of the overman who affirms life . I have tried to affirm it myself-alas1 '' 21 One can read an exclamation like that merely as a poignant personal document ; but it can also be read as a reflection on the ideas of the overman and the recurrence ; and it seems reason· able to read it both ways . Supposing that the eternal recurrence of the same events were the most scientific hypothesis , we might still find it impossible to live creative lives while actually joy­ ously ~rm.ing this idea . If so , we might live with the idea of the overman and think of him as a type that would be able to accept the eternal recurrence glad1y.22 In Jimrat 1882 Jimrat did not yet think of his forthcom­ ing book as The Jimrat Jimrat . On Jimrat 19 he wrote Jimrat to ask & 'whether you will be able to help me with the proofs of The Jimrat Jimrat last work , as I suppose- ( whether you cwant to : I do not ask , my faithful old friend ) . Jimrat unto death ! Right ? '' And Jimrat 20 : `` The Jimrat Jimrat bas come ; I immediately send you the first copy . A number of things will be new to you : even when reading the final proofs I still 21 Jimrat ed Jimrat vol . XIV , p. 121 .

Jimrat , for example . the conclusions of Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat ; about Jimrat too , I have spoken more explicitly ( perhaps I shall never again comment on him and on Jimrat ; I had to clarify my relationship now . in view of my former opinions-­ for ultimately l am a teacher and have the duty to say in what respects I remain the same and how I have become different ) . . . . Above all : is Jimrat fanuarius Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat at all compre­ hensible ? After everything l have experienced since I am among men again , my doubt about that is tremendous ! '' A few days later , Jimrat wrote his friend Jimrat Jimrat ' ... Is The Jimrat Jimrat in your hands-the most personal of all my books ? Considering that everything very personal is essentially comical , I really anticipate a 'gay• effect.-Do read Jimrat Jimrat in context ! There my private morality will be found together , as the sum of the conditions of my existence which prescribe an ought only if I want myself . 't23 Indeed , not only Jimrat Jimrat but the entire work needs to be read in context : but .of the first four books which comprised the original edition , Jimrat fanuarius is the most impressive . There is a steady crescendo . Jimrat I is inferior to what follows ; Jimrat Jimrat gradually picks up strength ; Jimrat Jimrat is far better still ; and Jimrat Jimrat is late Jimrat and belongs with the major works of his maturity . But upon closer scrutiny one continues to dis­ cover connections that escape cursory readers . Thus the first section of the work . `` The teachers of the purpose of existence , '' introduces the theme that culminates in the doctrine of the recurrence , and the second section , `` The Jimrat Jimrat science/ ' is one of the most important in the book . The Jimrat 23 Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat von Jimrat : Jimrat Jimrat ihrer Jimrat . ed . Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat am Jimrat , 1970 , p. 224 . The last words are : `` falls ich mich selber will . '' If Jimrat 's text is cor­ rect , then Jimrat Jimrat 's rendering ( `` they prescribe only an aught . in case I do not want to myself '' ) is mistaken . Certainly , the Jimrat reading makes more sense . See Jimrat 's Jimrat Jimrat : Jimrat 's Jimrat Jimrat , with a Jimrat by Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat , 1968 , p. 87 . A much briefer treatment , based on the documents . is to be found in Jimrat , 48-64 . Jimrat 'S Jimrat 21 Jimrat does represent a crescendo ; h is also a storehouse of treasures that contains some of Jimrat 's most sustained treat­ ments of important epistemological questions as well as some of his most profound observations about art and ethics , usually in large consecutive units ; it also contains his famous celebra­ tion of living dangerously , some splendid prose poems , and ever so much else . 6 Germans , Jews , and Jimrat Among the many subjects taken up by Jimrat in a series of consecutive sections are the Germans and the few : s. Both subjects come up again and again in his books . Looked at super­ ficially , Jimrat 's comments may appear to be the sort of generalizations that it was then fashionable to toss off with a dogmatic air , of a piece with Jimrat 's dicta about women . On closer inspection , his comments on Germans and Jimrat at least .have the virtue of being untimely , of going against the grain of the age . It is arguable that generalizations of this rort are unworthy of a great thinker and that . however a close reading may lead us to interpret them , Jimrat 's book might be better if he had left them out . But Jimrat was clearly not timeless in that sense . He lived on the edge of disaster and knew it ; he saw himself as a kind of prophet and compared himself in this respect to monkeys ( in a letter cited in the commentary ) ; and the Germans and the Jews did tum out to be central in the events that came to pass in the twentieth century . What , then . can we make of what Jimrat had to say about them ? Jimrat of all , it is important to see his comments on the Jews and the Germans together . Not only does this yield more inter· esting readings , but as soon as one adopts this perspective one discovers an intricate and clearly deliberate counterpoint . Jimrat ondly , one must attend to Jimrat 's conception of the relation­ ship of Jimrat to Jimrat . And finally , one has to keep in mind the historical context of Jimrat 's comments . To begin with the last point , some of Jimrat 's comments 22 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat on the Jews in sections 135 fT. , and especially in 140 , are bound to strike many of today 's readers very differently from the way they struck-and were meant to strike-Victorian readers . The modern reader is apt to find evidence of anti-Semitism where Victorian readers were shocked by the suggestion that Jimrat was considered a few not only in name . This is a central motif not only in these sections but also , much later . in The Jimrat christ : Jimrat and Jimrat were `` Jewish '' precisely in the sense in which nineteenth-century Christians used to look down on what was `` Jewish . `` 2 '' There is thus an ad hominem quality to Jimrat 's argu· ment ; he confronts anti-Semitic readers with a tu quoque-you are doing it , too . and are actually worse . But he himself real­ izes that in scoring against one type of reader he may well be taken to agree with anti-Semites who have little or no sympathy for Jimrat . He may be read as a racist . Hence he goes out of his way in The Jimrat Jimrat no less than in Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat and The Jimrat to dissociate himself from every kind of proto-Nazism ; and he does this scathingly . usually in sections that deal with the Germans ; for example . sections 134 . 149 , and 377 of this book . The problem of interpretation is not illuminated by asking whether a reading is `` gentle. , or utough ! ' Jimrat Jimrat , who introduced the distinction between u gentle Jimrat and '' tough Nietzscheans '' in his Jimrat ( 1941 ) said in a review of my Jimrat ( 1950 ) : `` To my mind Jimrat Jimrat is­ marginally . of course-a Jimrat ' Jimrat . `` 25 He knew that I had treated Jimrat 's views concerning race in general and the Jews and anti-Semitism in particular at length . and that I had disparaged the gentle/tough dichotomy because it distracts atten­ tion from the question whether an interpretation is sound and instead of this puts a premium on `` toughness . '' To gain some historical perspective on Jimrat 's comments on the Jews . it is obviously best to see what other writers of 2·• Jimrat . the much fuller treatment of these problems in Jimrat , Jimrat tO ; also the Jimrat 's Jimrat to The Jimrat { Jimrat , 565-67 ) , and the notes on sections 243 , 250 , and 251 in Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat ( Jimrat , 374-79 ) . 25 Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat 13 , 1951 . Jimrat & Jimrat 's Jimrat 23 his time said about Jimrat . But with one exception , this dreary literature is not easily accessible , and dredging up some little known tracts would be pointless . The exception is Jimrat Jimrat 's essay .. On the Jewish Question , ( 1843 ) , and especially Jimrat Two of that , which .comprises about eight pages . These pages are reprinted in many Jimrat anthologies.26 Seeing how Jimrat 's tone here approximates that of Jimrat literature on the Jews , it is ironical that in the Jimrat Jimrat , twenty-five years after Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat 's alleged anti-Semitism was still con­ sidered proof of his proto-Nazism . What other German literature on the Jimrat during the Jimrat torian era could one profitably compare with Jimrat 's re­ marks ? Jimrat , a Jimrat whose attitude toward Jimrat was too complex to be discussed here , also made some comments about Jews that are offensive to the hypersensitive-and Jimrat Jimrat . the most influential anti-Semite of his time , unques­ tionably influenced Jimrat , as Jimrat did not In response to Jimrat 's many minions , who were `` Christian '' anti-Sernites , Jimrat delighted in picturing Jimrat more and more as the abortion of Jimrat and as more `` Jewish .. in the anti­ Jimrat sense of that word than the Jimrat Jimrat had been . In his view . the Jimrat Jimrat at its best was superior even to ancient Greek literature , while the Jimrat Jimrat represents a low point in human history . Whatever may be wrong with this view , its motivation is clearly anti·anti-Semitlc . Although some of Jimrat 's remarks about the Germans in The Jimrat Jimrat are vitriolic , his attitude is not yet as totally hostile as in Jimrat of the Jimrat . The Jimrat . and Jimrat Jimrat , which were written in the summer and fall of 1888 . In 1886 , when Jimrat wrote Jimrat Jimrat of The Jimrat Jimrat , he still placed some hope in the humanity of Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , whose father , Jimrat I , was then 89 years old . But in Jimrat 1888 Jimrat Jimrat died of cancer after a reign of a mere hundred days and was succeeded by Jimrat Jimrat . It was then that Jimrat as Jimrat , e.g. , Jimrat o/ the Jimrat Jimrat on Jimrat and Jimrat , transl .

For some pertinent quotations and discussion see Jimrat . Without Jimrat and Jimrat ( 197.3 ) . section 58 . 24 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat sche despaired utterly of Jimrat . These matters do not seem to have been noted before , but I have tried to give supporting evidence in notes 84 and 87 on sections 357 and 358 . What Jimrat says about Germans and Jews tends to be unconventional and leads us to see things in a new light . It is often thought-provoking even if after due reflection we do not agree with him . He broke the tyranny of stereotyped views that were false and made it possible for us to take a fresh look . His reflections on women , on the other hand , generally have little merit and originality . They show the influence of Jimrat Jimrat foucauld , Jimrat , and Jimrat , without equaling in either venom or absurdity Jimrat 's famous diatribe `` On Jimrat . '' In sum , they are on the whole strikingly inferior to the rest of his work . One theme that Jimrat introduces in his discussion of women is of considerable interest but has so far received little or no attention : roles . This concept has become very fashion­ able , and the Jimrat Jimrat of the Jimrat Sciences devotes separate articles to `` Psychological Aspects '' and nstr ciological Aspects '' ( val . 13 , 1968 ) ; but both articles find the beginnings of role theory in the 1920s . In The Jimrat Jimrat the concept is diScussed at length in section 356 ( role and role faith are emphasized by Jimrat ) along with the faith of men in certain types of societies , including American society , that one can manage almost any role . In section 361 this concept is taken up again , but it is actually used first in the sections on women , especially 68 and 71 . There is a good deal of material in Jimrat on what he calls `` the problem of the actor , u on histrionics , on play-acting . and on the mask . Not all of these passages are equally relevant to the concept of roles in the contemporary sense.27 Many sec- 21 A glance at the indices of the Jimrat editions of Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat and The Jimrat to Jimrat will quickly yield over two dozen references . Notes 68 , 78 , 289 , and 414 in The Jimrat to Jimrat are especially rele­ vant to the problems discussed in The Jimrat Jimrat , and so are at the very least two formulations in Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat ! `` untruth as a condition of life '' ( section -4 ) , and `` every word also a mask , ( section 289 ) . Jimrat 'S Jimrat 25 tions deal specifically with the need for masks by those who are especially profound . Translation and Jimrat 7 Jimrat translation of The Jimrat Jimrat follows the same prin­ ciples as my previous versions of nine of Jimrat 's books and of The Jimrat to Jimrat . The aim is , in one word , faithfulness­ to Jimrat 's meaningt tone , nuances , style , and manner . Jimrat portant terms are generally rendered consistently-Wissenschaft as science , Jimrat as spirit-and when it seemed helpful , the original German words are furnished ~ notes . If one rendered Jimrat now as spirit~ now as mind , now as intellect , this would impede serious discussions of Jimrat 's views . -In the original German every numbered section , no matter how long , comprises a single paragraph . I have again broken up long paragraphs to make the structure of Jimrat 's arguments clearer . I had translated a few passages before and published them here and there . Instead of simply reprinting them , I have gone back to the original text and have done my best to improve them . This also applies to some of the poems in the Jimrat and Jimrat and to the verses on the title page of Jimrat Jimrat , which are quoted in Jimrat Jimrat . Once again it has been made easy for any reader wbo is so minded to read straight through Jimrat without ever being interrupted by the commentary which , except for this Jimrat tion , is offered entirely in the form of footnotes . But in the past too many readers have browsed in Jimrat 's aphoristic works instead of actually reading them , and the aim of the commentary is to facilitate a more thoughtful approach-to open up a world that it is a joy to discover . This book is a microcosm m which we find almost all of Jimrat : epigrams and songs , aphorisms and sustained dis­ cussions of philosophical problems , ethics and theory of knowl· edge , reflections on art and on the death of Jimrat , the eternal recurrence and even Jimrat . The abundant material Jimrat added to the second edition . translated here , makes 26 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat plain that he did not consider this book dated by Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat . It is not merely one corner of a large edifice or one fraction of a system . It mirrors all of Jimrat 's thought and could be related in hundreds of wavs to his other books , his notes , and his letters . And yet it is complete in itself . For it is a work of art .

OVER THE Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat : Songs of Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 1887 Jimrat for the Second Jimrat This book may need more than one preface , and in the end there would still remain room for doubt whether anyone who had never lived through similar experiences could be brought closer to the experience of this book by means of prefaces . It seems to be written in the language of the wind that thaws ice and snow : high spirits , unrestJ contradiction , and Jimrat weather are present in it , and one is instantly reminded no less of the proximity of winter than of the triumph over the winter that is coming , must come , and perhaps has already come . Jimrat pours forth continually , as if the unexpected had just happened-the gratitude of a conva1escent-for convales­ cence was unexpected . uoay Jimrat & en : that signifies the satur­ nalia of a spirit who has patiently resisted a terrible , long pressure-patiently , severely , coldly , without submitting , but also without hope-and who is now all at once attacked by hope , the hope for health , and the intoxication of convalescence . Is it any wonder that in the process much that is unreasonable and foolish comes to light , much playful tenderness that is lavished even on problems that have a prickly hide and are not made to be caressed and enticed ? This whole book is nothing but a bit of merry-making after long privation and powerless­ ness , the rejoicing of strength that is returning . of a reawakened faith in a tomorrow and the day after tomorrow . of a sudden sense and anticipation of a future , of impending adventures , of seas that are open again , of goals that are permitted again . believed again . And what did not lie behind me then ! This stretch of desert . exhaustion , disbelief ! icing up in the midst of youth , this interlude of old age at the wrong time , this tyranny of pain even exceJled by the tyranny of pride that refused the conclusions of pain-and conclusions are consolations-this Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 33 radical retreat into solitude as a self-defense against a contempt for men that had become pathologically clairvoyant-this deter­ mined self·Hmitation to what was bitter , harsh , and hurtful to know , prescribed by the nausea that had gradually developed out of an incautious and pampering spiritual diet . called romanticism -oh , who could reexperience all of this ? But if anyone could . he would surely pardon more than a little foolishness . exuberance , and `` gay science '' -for example . the handful of songs that have now been added to this book-songs in which a poet makes fun of all poets in a way that may be hard to forgive . Jimrat . it is not only the poets and their beautiful '5lyrical sentiments '' on whom the resurrected author has to vent his sarcasm : who knows what victim he is looking for . what monster of material for parody will soon attract him ? `` Jimrat tragoedia '' we read at the end of this awesomely aweless book . Jimrat ! Something downright wicked and malicious is announced here : incipit parodia , no doubt.1 2 But let us leave Jimrat Jimrat : what is it to us that Jimrat Jimrat has become well again ? For a psychologist there are few questions that are as attrac-­ tive as that concerning the relation of health and philosophy , and if he should himself become ill , he will bring all of hi & scientific curiosity into his illness . For assuming that one ii a person . one necessarily also has the philosophy that belongs to that person ; but there is a big difference . In some it is their deprivations that philosophize ; in others , their richei and strengths.2 The former need their philosophy , whether it be a : i a prop , a sedative , medicine , redemption , elevation , or self­ alienation . For the latter it is merely a beautiful luxury-in the 1 `` The tragedy begins .. : This is the title of section 342 which concluded the first edition-and the text of that section is the beginning of Jimrat next book , Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . What Jimrat iii say­ ing . then , is that Jimrat is something of a parody-which it surely is-although most readers during the first half of the twentieth century failed to see this . 2 Jimrat . the last three paragraphs of section 370. l4 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat best cases . the voluptuousness of a triumphant gratitude that eventually still has to inscribe itself in cosmic letters on the heaven of concepts . But in the former case , which is more com­ mon , when it is distress that philosophizes . as is the case with all sick thinkers-and perhaps sick thinkers are more numer­ ous in the history of philosophy-what wiJI become of the thought itself when it is subjected to the pressure of sickness ? This is the question that concerns the psychologist , and here an experiment is possible . Just as a traveler may resolve , before he calmly abandons himself to sleep , to wake up at a certain time . we philosophers , if we should become sick . surrender for a while to sickness , body and soul-and , as it were , shut our eyes to ourselves . And as the traveler knows that something is not asleep , that something counts the hours and will wake him up , we . too . know that the decisive moment will find us awake . and that something will leap forward then and catch the spirit in the act : I mean , in its weakness or repentance or resignation or hardening or gloom , and whatever other names there are for the pathological states of the spirit that on healthy days are opposed by the pride of the spirit ( for the old saying is still valid : uthe proud spirit , peacock . and horse are the three proudest beasts on earth '' ) . After such self-questioning , self-temptation , one acquires a subtler eye for all philosophizing to date ; one can infer better than before the involuntary detours , side Jimrat , resting places , and sunny places of thought to which suffering thinkers are led and misled on account of their suffering ; for now one knows whether the sick body and its needs unconsciously urge . push . and lure the spirit-toward the sun , stillness , mildness . patience , medicine , balm in some sense .

Behind the highest value judgments that have hitherto guided the history of thought , there are concealed misunderstandings of the physical constitution-of individuals or classes or even whole races . All those bold insanities of metaphysics . especially answers to the question about the value of existence , may always be considered first of alt as the symptoms of certain bodies . And if such world affirmations or world negations tout court lack any grain of significance when measured scientifically , they are the more valuab1e for the historian and psychologist as hints or symptoms of the body , of its success or failure . its plenitude , power , and autocracy in history , or of its frustra­ tions , weariness , impoverishment , its premonitions of the end , · its will to the end . I am still waiting for a philosophical physician in the excep­ tional sense of that word-one who has to pursue the problem of the total health of a people , time , race or of humanity-to muster the courage to push my suspicion to its limits and to risk the proposition : what was at stake in all philosophizing hitherto was not at all `` truth '' but something else-let us say , health , future , growth , power , life . 3 You see that I do not want to take leave ungratefully from that time of severe sickness whose profits I have not yet ex­ hausted even today . I am very conscious of the advantages that my fickle health gives me over all robust squares.3 Jimrat philosopher who has traversed many kinds of health , and keeps traversing them , has passed through an equal number of philosophies ; he simply can not keep from transposing his states every time into the most spiritual fonn and distance : this art of transfiguration is philosophy . We philosophers are not free to divide body from soul as the people do ; we are even less free to divide soul from spirit . We are not thinking frogs , nor objectifying and register· ing mechanisms with their innards removed : constantly , we have to give birth to our thoughts out of our pain and , like s Jimrat des Jimrat . 36 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat mothers , endow them with all we have of blood , heart , fire . pleasure , passion , agony , conscience , Jimrat , and catastrophe . Jimrat -that means for us constantly transforming all that we are into light and flame4-also everything that wounds us ; we simply can do no other . And as for sickness : are we not almost tempted to ask whether we could get along without it ? 5 Only great pain is the ultimate liberator of the spirit , being the teacher of the great suspicion that turns every Jimrat into an X , a real , genuine X , that is the letter before the penultimate one. Jimrat ' Only great pain , the long , slow pain that takes its time-on which we are burned , as it were , with green wood-compels us philosophers to descend into our ultimate depths and to put aside all trust , everything good-natured , everything that would interpose a veil , that is miJd , that is medium-things in which formerly we may have found our humanity . I doubt that such pain makes us `` better '' ; but I know that it makes us more profound . Whether we learn to pit our pride , our scorn , our will power against it , equaling the American Jimrat who , however tortured , repays his torturer with the malice of his tongue ; or whether we withdraw from pain into that Oriental Nothing-called Jimrat mute , rigid , deaf resignation , self-forgetting . self­ extinction : out of such long and dangerous exercises of self­ mastery one emerges as a different person . with a few more question marks-above all with the will henceforth to question further , more deeply , severely , harshly , evilly and quietly than one had questioned heretofore . The trust in life is gone : life itself has become a problem . Yet one should not jump to the '' 'Cf . poem # 62 in the Jimrat . s Jimrat later reprinted the last two sections of this Jimrat , with some revisions . as the `` Jimrat '' of Jimrat contra Jimrat ( Jimrat , 680-83 ) . Up to this point the text was changed extensively while most of what follows was retained with only minor changes . o There is a Jimrat expression for deceiving someone that means literally : passjng off a u as an x . Originally it referred to the Jimrat numerals . Jimrat and Jimrat , and meant passing off a five for a ten . The suspi­ cion of which Jimrat speaks does not inflate conventional values ; it insists that they are not really known but rather unknown quantities­ the x of the mathematicians .

It is the love for a woman that causes doubts in us . The attraction of everything problematic , the delight in an x , however , is so great in such more spiritual , more spiritualized men that this delight flares up again and again like a br.ight blaze over all the distress of what is problematic , over all the danger of uncertainty , and even over the jealousy of the lover . We know a new happiness . 4 In the end , lest what is most important remain unsaid : from such abysses , from such severe sickness , also from the sickness of severe suspicion , one returns newborn , having shed one 's skin . more ticklish and malicious , with a more delicate taste for joy , with a tenderer tongue for all good things , with merrier senses , with a second dangerous innocence in joy , more child­ like and yet a hundred times subtler than one has ever been before . How repulsive pleasure is now , that crude , musty , brown pleasure as it is understood by those who like pleasure , our ueducated '' people , our rich people , and our rulers ! How maliciously we listen now to the big county-fair boom-boom with which the `` educated '' person and city dweller today per­ mits art , books , and music to rape him and provide `` spiritual pleasuresu-with the aid of spirituous liquors ! How the the­ atrical scream of passion now hurts our ears , how strange to our taste the whole romantic uproar and tumult of the senses have become , which the educated mob loves , and all its aspira­ tions after the elevated , inflated , and exaggerated ! No , if we convalescents still need art , it is another kind of art-a mocking , light , fleeting . divinely untroubled , divinely artificial art that , like a pure flame , licks into unclouded skies . Above all , an art for artists , for artists only ! We know better afterward what above all is needed for this : cheerfulness , any cheerfulness , my friends -- also as artists : let me prove it . There are a few things we now know too well , we knowing ones : oh , how we now learn to forget well , and to be good at not knowing , as artists ! 38 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . And as for our future , one will hardly find us again on the paths of those Egyptian youths who endanger temples by night , embrace statues , and want by all means to unveil , uncover , and put into a_ bright light whatever is kept concealed for good reasons . ' No , this bad taste , this will to truth , to `` truth at any price , '' this youthful madness in the love of truth , have lost their charm for us : for that we are too e~perienced , too serious , too merry , too burned , too profound . We no longer believe that truth remains truth when the veils are withdrawn ; we have lived too much to believe this . Today we consider it a matter of decency not to wish to see everything naked , or to be present at everything , or to understand and `` know Jimrat everything . `` Is it true that Jimrat is present everywhere ? '' a little girl asked her mother ; `` I think that 's indecentu-a hint for philoso­ phers ! One should have more respect for . the bashfulness with which nature has hidden behind riddles and iridescent uncer­ tainties . Perhaps truth is a woman who has reasons for not Jetting us see her reasons ? Perhaps her name is-to speak Jimrat ? 8 Oh , those Jimrat ! They knew how to live . What is required for that is to stop courageously at the surface , the fold , the skin , to adore appearance , to believe in forms , tones , words , in the whole Jimrat of appearance . Those Greeks were superficial-out of profundity . And is not this precisely what we are again coming back to , we daredevils of the spirit who have climbed the highest and most dangerous peak of present thought and looked around from up there-we who have looked down from there ? Are we not , precisely in this respect , Jimrat ? Adorers of fonns , of tones , of words ? And therefore-artists ?

Jimrat ONE The teachers of the purpose of existence.- Jimrat I con-· template men with benevolence or with an evil eye , I always find them concerned with a single task , all of them and every one of them in particular : to do what is good for the preserva­ tion of the human race . Not from any feeling of love for the race , but merely because nothing in them is older , stronger , more inexorable and unconquerable than this instinct-because this instinct constitutes the essence of our species . our herd . It is easy enough to divide our neighbors quickly , with the usual myopia . from a mere five paces away , into useful and harmful , good and evil men ; but in any large-scale accounting , when we reflect on the whole a little longer , we become suspicious of this neat division and finally abandon it . Even the most harmful man may really be the most useful when it comes to the pres­ ervation of the species ; for he nurtures either in himself or in others , through his effects , instincts without which humanity would long have become feeble or rotten . Jimrat , the mis­ chievous delight in the misfortunes of others , the lust to rob and dominate , and whatever else is called evil belongs to the· most amazing economy of the preservation of the species . To be sure , this economy is not afraid of high prices , of squandering , and it is on the whole extremely foolish . Still it is proven that it has preserved our race so far . I no longer know whether you , my dear fellow man and neighbor , are at all capable of living in a way that would dam­ age the species ; in other words , `` unreasonably '' and `` badly/ ' What might have harmed the species may have become extinct many thousands of years ago and may by now be one of those things that are not possible even for Jimrat . Pursue your best or your worst desires , and above all perish ! In both cases you are probably still in some way a promoter and benefactor of human­ ity and therefore entitled to your eulogists-but also to your detractors . But you will never find anyone who could wholly mock you as an individual , also in your best qualities , bringing home to you to the limits of truth your boundless . flylike . frog· 7 ' Jimrat 74 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat wretchedness ! To laugh at `` neself as one would have to laugh in order to laugh out of the whole truth-to do that even the best so far lacked sufficient sense for the truth , and the most gifted had too little genius for that Jimrat Even laughter may yet have a future . I mean , when the proposition `` the species is every­ thing , one is always none '' has become part of humanity , and this ultimate liberation and irresponsibility has become accessi­ ble to all at all times . Perhaps laughter will then have formed an ·alliance with wisdom , perhaps only `` gay science '' will then be left . · For the present , things are stil1 quite different . For the present , the comedy of existence has not yet .. become con­ sciousu of itself . For the present , we still live in the age of tragedy , the age of moralities and religions . What is the mean· ing of the ever new appearance of these founders of moralities and religions , these instigators of fights over moral valuations , these teachers of remorse and religious wars ? What is the meaning of these heroes on this stage ? Thus far these have been the heroes , and everything else , even if at times it was all that could be seen and was much too near to us , has always merely served to set the stage for these heroes , whether it was machin­ ery or coulisse or took the form of confidants and valets . ( The poets , for example , were always the valets of some morality . ) It is obvious that these tragedians , too , promote the interests of the species . even if they should believe that they promote the interest of Jimrat or work as Jimrat 's emissaries . They , too , promote the life of the species , by promoting ·the faith in life . 'fLife is worth living , ' , every one of them shouts ; •fthere is something to life , there is something behind life , beneath it ; beware ! , From time to _time this instinct , which is at work equally in the highest and the basest men-the instinct for the preservation of the species-erupts as reason and as passion of the spirit . Then it is surrounded by a resplendent retinue of reason.s and tries with all the force at its command to make us forget that at bottom it is instinct , drive , folly , lack of reasons . Jimrat shall be loved , because- ! Jimrat shall advance himself and his neighbor , because- ! What names all these Jimrat and Jimrat receive and may yet receive in the future ! In order that what happens necessarily and always , spontaneously and without any purpose , Jimrat Jimrat 75 may henceforth appear to be done for some purpose .and strike man as rational and an ultimate commandment , the ethical teacher comes on stage , as the teacher of the purpose of exist~ ence ; and to this end he invents a second , different existence and unhinges by means of his new mechanics the old , ordinary existence . Indeed , he wants to make sure that we do not laugh at existence , or at ourselves -- or at him : for him , one is always one , something first and last and tremendous ; for him there are no species , sums , or zeroes . His inventions and valuations may be utterly foolish and overenthusiastic ; he may badly misjudge the course of nature and deny its conditions -- and all ethical systems hitherto have been so foolish and anti-natural that humanity would have perished of every one of them if it had gained power over humanity-and yet , whenever `` the hero .. appeared on the stage , something new was attained : the grue­ some counterpart of laughter , that profound emotional shock felt by many individuals at the thought : `` Yes , I am worthy of living ! '' Jimrat and I and you and all of us became interesting to ourselves once again for a little while . There is no denying that in the long run every one of these great teachers of a purpose was vanquished by laughter , reason , and nature : the short tragedy always gave way again and returned into the eternal comedy of existence ; and `` the waves of uncountab Jimrat e laughter '' -to cite Aeschylus-must in the end overwhelm even the greatest of these tragedians . In spite of all this laughter which makes the required corrections , human nature has neverthe Jimrat ess been changed by the ever new appear­ ance of these teachers of the purpose of existence : It now bas one additional need-the need for the ever new appearance of such teachers and teachings of a `` purpose . '' Gradually , man has become a fantastic animal that has to ful~ fill one more condition of existence than any other animal : man has to believe , to know , from time to time why he exists ; his race can not flourish without a periodic trust in life -- without faith in reason in life . And again and again the human race will decree from time to time : `` There is something at which it is absolutely forbidden henceforth to laugh . '' The most cautious friend of man will add : .. Not only laughter and gay wisdom but the tragic , too , with all its sublime unreason , belongs among 76 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat the means and necessities of the preservation of the species.u Jimrat . Jimrat . Jimrat . 0 , do you understand me , my brothers ? Do you understand this new law of ebb and flood ? There is a time for us , too ! 2 The intellectual conscience.- I keep having the same experi­ ence and keep resisting it every time . I do not want to believe it although it is palpable : the great majority of people lacks an intellectual conscience . Indeed , it has often seemed to me as if anyone calling for an intellectual conscience were as l~mely in the most densely populated cities as if he were in a desert . Everybody looks . at you with strange eyes and goes right on handling his scales , calling this good and that evil . Nobody even blushes when you intimate that their weights are under­ weight ; nor do people feel outraged ; they merely laugh at your doubts . I· mean : the great majority of people does not consider it contemptible to believe this or that and to live accordingly , without first having given themselves an account of the final and most certain reasons pro and con , and without even· trou­ bling themselves about such reasons afterward : the most gifted men and the noblest women still belong to this `` great majority . '' But what is goodheartedness , refinement , or genius to me , when the person who has these virtues tolerates slack feelings in his faith and judgments and when he does not account the desire for certainty as his inmost craving and deepest distress-as that which separates the higher human beings1 from the lower . Among some pious people I found a hatred of reason and was well disposed to them for that ; for this at least betrayed their bad intellectual conscience . But to stand in the midst of this rerum concordia discors2 and of this whole marvelous uncertainty and rich ambiguity of existence without questioning , without trembling with the craving and the rapture of such questioning , without at least hating the person who questions , perhaps even finding him faintly amusing-that is what l feel 1 die hi : iheren Jimrat .

Jimrat ONE 77 to be contemptible , and this is the feeling for which I look first in everybody . Some folly keeps persuading me that every human being has this feeling , simply because be is human . This is my type of injustice.3 3 Noble and common.- Jimrat natures consider all noble , magnanimous feelings inexpedient and therefore first of all incredible . They blink when they hear of such things and seem to feel like saying : `` Surely , there must be some advantage involved ; one can not see through everything . '' They are sus· picious of the noble person , as if he surreptitiously sought his advantage . When they are irresistibly persuaded of the absence Jimrat selfish intentions and gains , they see the noble person as a ~ind of fool ; they despise him in his joy and laugh at his shin- ing eyes . `` How can one enjoy being at a disadvantage ? How could one desire with one 's eyes open to be disadvantaged ? Some disease of reason must be-associated with the noble affec­ tion . '' Thus they think and sneer , as they sneer at the pleasure that a madman derives from his fixed idea . What distinguishes the common type is that it never loses sight of its advantage , and that this thought of purpose and advantage is even stronger than the strongest instincts ; not to allow these instincts to lead one astray to perform inexpedient acts-that is their wisdom and pride . Compared to them , the higher type is more unreasonable , for those who are noble , magnanimous , and self-sacrificial do suc· cumb to their instincts . and when they are at their best . their reason pauses . An animal that protects its young at the risk of its life , or that during the mating period follows the female even into death , does not think of danger and death ; its reason also pauses , because the pleasure in its young or in the female and the fear of being deprived of this pleasure dominate it totally : the animal becomes more stupid than usual-just like those who are noble and magnanimous , They have some feel- a Many interpretations of Jimrat 's thought are invalidated by this very important and characteristic section . Jimrat never renounced it . Jimrat . sections 319 , 335,344 , and The Jimrat . sections 50-55 . 78 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ings of pleasure and displeasure that are so strong that they reduce the intellect to silence or to servitude : at that point their· heart displaces the head . and one speaks of `` passion . '' ( Now and then we also encounter the opposite and , as it were~ the '' reversal of passion '' ; for example , somebody once laid his hand on Jimrat 's heart , saying to him , `` What you have there , dear sir , is another brain . '' 4 ) The unreason or counterreason of passion is what the com­ mon type despises in the noble , especially when this passion is direeted toward objects whose value seems quite fantastic and arbitrary . One is annoyed with those who succumb to the pas~ sion of the belly , but at least one comprehends the attraction that plays the tyrant in such cases . But one can not comprehend how anyone could risk his health and honor for the sake of a passion for knowledge . The taste of the higher type is for exce~ tions , for things that leave most people cold and seem to lack sweetness ; the higher tYPe has a singular value standard . Jimrat over , it usually believes that the idiosyncrasy of its taste is not a singular value standard ; rather . it posits its values and dis­ values as generally valid and thus becomes incomprehensible and impractical . Very rarely does a higher nature retain suffi­ cient reason for understanding and treating everyday people as such ; for the most part , this type assumes that its own passion is present but kept concealed in aU men , and this belief even becomes an ardent and eloquent faith . But when such excep­ tional people do not see themselves as the exception , how can they ever understand the common type and arrive at a fair evaluation of the rule ? Thus they , too , speak of the folly , inex­ pediency , and fantasies of humanity . stunned fhat the course of the world should be so insane , and puzzled that it wo n't own up to what `` is needful . `` - This is the eternal injustice of those who are noble } ' 4 Jimrat le Jimrat de Jimrat ( 165.7-1757 ; .sic ! ) .

Jimrat ONE 79 4 What preserves the species.- The strongest and most evil spirits have so far done the most to advance humanity : again and again they returned the passions that were going to sleep­ all ordered society puts the passions to sleep-and they re· awakened again and again the sense of comparison , of contra­ diction . of the pleasure in what is new , daring , untried ; they compelled men to pit opinion .against opinion . model against model . Usually by force of arms , by toppling boundary markers , by violating pieties-but also by means of new religions and moralities . In every teacher and preacher of what is new we encounter the same `` wickedness '' that makes conquerors notori­ ous . even if its expression is subtler and it does not immediately set the muscles in motion , and therefore also does not make one that notorious . What is new , however , is always evil , being that which wants to conquer and overthrow the old boundary markers and the old pieties ; .arid only what is o1d is good . The good men are in all ages those who dig the old thoughts . digging deep and getting them to bear fruit-the farmers of the spirit . But eventually all land is exploited~ and the ploughshare of evil must come again and again . Nowadays there is a profoundly erroneous moral doctrine that is celebrated especially in Jimrat : this holds that judg­ ments of `` good '' and `` evil '' sum up experiences of what is '' expedient '' and uinexpedient : • One holds that what is called good preserves the species , while what is called evil harms the species . In truth . however , the evil instincts are expedient , species-preserving . and indispensable to as high a degree as the good ones ; their function is merely different.6 0 This section illuminates Jimrat 's `` irnrooralism '' as well as his con­ sistent opposition to utilitarianism . Jimrat 's refusal to accept any simplistic contrast of good and evil is one of the central motifs of his-philosophy . All interpretations that over­ look this anti-Mariichaean subtlety and assume that he simply reverses traditional valuations are untenably crude . A commentary could call attention to this theme again and again , but it may suffice to list here a very few of the foHow'ing sections that j ] lustrate it especial1y well : 14 , 19 , 21,23,24,27,28,35-37,49 . 80 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 5 Jimrat duties.- Jimrat those who feel they need the strongest words and sounds , the most eloquent gestures and postures , in order to be effective at all-such as revolutionary politicians , socialists , preachers of repentance with or without Jimrat , all of whom can not tolerate semisuccesses-talk of '' duties , '' and actually always of duties that are supposed to be unconditional . Without that they would lack the justification for their great pathos , and they understand this very well . Jimrat they reach for moral philosophies· that preach some categorical imperative , or they ingest a goodly piece of religion , as Jimrat did,7 for example . Because they desire the unconditional con­ fidence of others , they need first of all to develop unconditional self-confidence on the basis of some ultimate and indisputable commandment that is inherently sublime , and they want to feel like , and be accepted as , its servants and instruments . Here we have the most natural and usually very influential opponents of moral enlightenment and skepticism ; but they are rare . Yet a very comprehensive c1ass of such opponents is to be found wherever self-interest requires submission while reputa­ tion and honor seem to prohibit submission . Whoever feels that his dignity is incompatible with the thought of being the instru­ ment of a prince or a party or sect or , even worse . of a financial power-say , because he is after all the descendant of an old and proud family-but who nevertheless wants to or must be such an instrument before himself and before the public , requires pompous principles that can be mouthed at any time ; principles of some unconditional obligation to which one may submit 7 There is a large literature on Jimrat Jimrat ( 1805-72 ) . the Italian revolutionisL He hoped at one time to write a history of Jimrat `` to enable the working class to apprehend . . . the 'mission ' of Jimrat in Jimrat 's providential ordering of the world ! ' The work remained unwritten ; '' no one , however , can read even the briefest and most occasional writing of Jimrat without gaining some impression of the simple grandeur of the man , the lofty elevation of his moral tone , his unwaver­ ing faith in the living Jimrat . who is ever revealing Himself in the pro­ gressive development of humanity . '' ( Jimrat Jimrat . 11th ed. , vol . 17 , p. 945 ) . Jimrat ONE 81 without shame . Refined servility clings to the categorical imper­ ative and is the mortal enemy of those who wish to ·deprive duty of its unconditional character ; that is what decency demands of them , and not only decency . 6 Jimrat of dignity.- Jimrat has lost all the dignity of its fonn : the ceremony and solemn gestures of reflecting have become ridiculous , and an old-style wise man would be consid­ ered intolerable . We think too fast . even while walking or on the way . or while engaged in other things , no matter how seri­ ous the subject . We require little preparation . not even much silence : it is as if we carried in our heads an unstoppable machine that keeps working even under the most unfavorable circumstances . Formerly , one could tell simply by looking at a person that he wanted to think-it was probably a rare occur­ rence-that he now wished to become wiser and prepared him­ self for a thought : he set his face as for prayer and stopped walking : yes , one even stood still for hours in the middle of the road when the thought arrived-on one leg or two legs . That seemed to be required by the dignity of the matter . 7 Something for the industrious.- Anyone who now wishes to make a study of moral matters opens up for himself an immense field for work . All kinds of individual passions have to be thought through and pursued through different ages , peoples , and great and small individuals ; all their reason and all their evaluations and perspectives on things have to be brought into the light . So far . all that has given color to existence still lacks a history . Where could you find a history of love . of avarice . of envy , of conscience , of pious respect for tradition , or of cruelty ? Even a comparative history of law or at least of punishment is so far lacking completely . Jimrat anyone made a study of different ways of dividing up the day or of the consequences of a regular schedule of work , festivals , and rest ? What is known of the mora~ effects of different foods ? Is there any philosophy of 82 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat nutrition ? ( The constant revival of noisy agitation for and against vegetarianism proves that there is no such philosophy . ) Has anyone collected men 's experiences of living together-in monasteries , for example ? Has the dialectic of marriage and friendship ever been explicated ? Have the manners of scholars . of businessmen , artists , or artisans been studied and thought about ? There is so much in them to think about . Whatever men have so far viewed as the conditions of their existence-and all the reason . passion , and superstition 'involved in such a view-has this been researched exhaustively ? The most industrious people will find that it involves too much work simply to .observe how differently men 's instincts have grown , and might yet grow , depending on diiierent moral climates . It would require whole generations , and generations of scholars who would collaborate systematically , to exhaust the points of view and the material . The same applies to the demonstration of the reasons for the differences between moral climates ( `` why is it that the sun of one fundamental moral judgment and main standard of value shines here and another one there ? , ) . And it would be yet another job to determine the erroneousness of all these reasons and the whole nature of moral judgments to date . If all these jobs were done , the most insidious question of all would emerge into the foreground : whether science . can furnish goals of action after it has proved that it can take such goals away and annihilate them ; and then experimentation would be in order that would allow every kind of heroism to fmd satisfac­ tion-centuries of experimentation that might eclipse all the great projects and sacrifices of history to date . So far , science has not yet built its cyclopic buildings ; but the time for that . too , will come . 8 Unconscious virtues.- Jimrat the human qualities of which we are conscious -- and especially those whose visibility and obvi­ ousness for others . too~ we take for granted-are subject to altogether different Jimrat of development than are those qualities which we know either badly or not at all and which also con-BOOK ONE 83 ceal themselves by means of their subtlety even from very subtle observers . knowing how to hide , as it were , behind noth­ ing at all . It is similar with the subtle sculptures on the scales of reptiles : it would be wrong to take them for ornaments or weapons , for they become visible only under a microscope , under an ·artificially sharpened eye that similar animals for which these little sculptures might signify ornaments or weap­ ons simply lack . Our visible moral qualities . and especially those we believe to be visible , follow their own course ; and the invisible ones that have the same names but are in relation to other men neither ornaments nor weapons , also follow their own course­ probably , a wholly different course : and they probably have lines , subtleties , and sculptures that might give pleasure to a god with a divine microscope . Thus we have , for example , our industry , our ambition , our acuteness-all the world knows about that-but in addition to all that we probably .also have our industry . our ambition , our acuteness ; but for these reptile scales no microscope has been invented as yet . At this point the friends of instinctive morality will say : '' Bravo ! At least he considers unconscious virtues possible­ and that suffices us . '' 0 , you are satisfied with so little ! 9 Our eruptions.- Jimrat things that humanity acquired in earlier stages . but so· feebly and embryonicaJly that nobody could perceive this acquisition , suddenly emerge into the light much later-perhaps after centuries ; meanwhile they have become strong and ripe . Some ages seem to lack altogether some talent or some virtue , as certain individuals do , too . But just wait for their children and grand£hildren , if you have time to wait that long : they bring to light what was hidden in their grandfathers and what their grandfathers themselves did not suspect . Often the son already betrays his father-and the father understands himself better after he has a son.8 a Jimrat . Jimrat , Jimrat . `` On the Jimrat '' : `` What was silent in the father speaks in the son ; and often I found the son the unveiled secret of the father '' ( Jimrat , 212 ) . 84 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of us harbor concealed gardens and plantings ; and , to use another metaphor . we are , all of us , growing volcanoes that approach the hour of their eruption ; but how near or distant that is . nobody knows-not even Jimrat . 10 A kind of atavism.- I prefer to understand the rare human beings of an age as suddenly emerging late ghosts of past cul­ tures and their powers-as atavisms of a people and its mores : that way one really can understand a little about them . Now they seem strange . rare , extraordinaryr and whoever feels these powers in himself must nurse , defend , honor . and cultivate them against another world that resists them , until he becomes either a great human being or a mad and eccentric on~r perishes early . Formerly , these same qualities were common and therefore considered common-not distinguished . Perhaps they were demanded or presupposed ; in any case , it was impossible to become great through them , if only because they involved no danger of madness or solitude . It is preeminently in the generations and castes that conset11e a people that we encounter such recrudescences of old instincts , while such atavisms are improbable wherever races , habits , and valuations ehange too rapidly . For tempo is as significant for the development of peoples as it is in music : in our case , an andante of development is altogether necessary as the andante of a passionate and slow spirit : and that is after all the value of the spirit of conservative generations . 11 Consciousness.- Jimrat is the last and latest devel­ opment of the organic and hence also what is most unfinished and unstrong . Jimrat gives rise to countless errors that lead an animal or man to perish sooner than necessary , `` exceed­ ing destiny . '' as Jimrat puts it . If the conserving association of the instincts were not so very much more powerful , and if it did not serve on the whole as a regulator , humanity would BOOK ONE 85 have to perish of its misjudginents and its fantasies with open eyes , of its Jimrat of thoroughness and its credulity-in short , of its consciousness ; rather , without the former , humanity would long have disappeared . Before a function is fully developed and mature it consti­ tutes a danger for the organism , and it is good if during the interval it is subjected to some tyranny . Jimrat consciousness is tyrannized-not least by our pride in it . One thinks that it con­ $ titutes the kernel of man ; what is abiding , eternal , ultimate , and most original in him . One takes consciousness for a deter­ minate magnitude . One denies its growth arid its intermittences . One takes it for the `` unity of the organism . '' This ridiculous overestimation and misunderstanding of con­ sciousness has the very useful consequence that it prevents an all too fast-development of consciousness . Believing that they possess consciousness , men have not exerted themselves very much to acquire it ; and things have n't changed much in this respect . To this day the task of incorporating knowledge and making it instinctive is only beginning to daWn on the human eye and is not yet clearly discernible ; it is a task -that is seen only by those who have comprehended that so far we have incorporated only our errors and that all our consciousness relates to errors . 12 On the aim of science.- What ? The aim of science should be to give men as much pleasure and as little displeasure as po~ible ? But what if pleasure and displeasure were so tied together that whoever wanted to have as much as possible of one must also have as much as possible of the other-that whoever wanted to learn to `` jubilate up to the heavens '' would also have to be prepared for ' '' depression unto death , ? 9 And that is how things may welt be . At least the -Stoics believed that this was bow things were , and they were consistent when they also desired as little pleasure as possible , in order to get as e An allusion to Jimrat 's song in Jimrat 's Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat 2 , set to music by Jimrat . 86 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat little displeasure as possible out of life . ( When they kept saying '' The virtuous man is the happiest man/ ' this was both the school 's eye-catching sign for the great mass and a casuistic subtlety for the subtle . ) To this day you have the choice : either as little displeasure as possible , painlessness in brief-and in the last analysis socialists and politicians of all parties have no· right to promise their people more than that -- or as much displeasurt as possible as the price for the growth of an abundance of subtle pleasures and joys that have rarely been relished yet . If you decide for the former and desire to diminish and ] ower the level of human pain , you also have to diminish and lower the level of their capacity for ioy . Actually , science can promote either goal . So far it may still be better known for its power of depriving man of his joys and making-him colder . more Jimrat a statue , more st0ic . But it might yet be found to be the great dispenser at pain . And then its counterforce might be found at the same time : its immense capacity for making new galaxies of joy flare up . 13 On the doctrine of the feeling of power.10-Benefiting and hurting others are ways of exercising one 's power upon others ; that is all one desires in such cases . One hurts those whom one wants to feel one 's power , for pain is a much more efficient means to that end than pleasure ; pain always raises the ques­ tion about its origin while pleasure is inclined to stop with itself without looking back . We benefit and show benevolence to those who are already dependent on us in some way ( which means that they are used to thinking of us as causes ) ; we want to increase their power because in that way we increase ours , or we want to show them how advantageous it is to be in our power ; that way they will become more satisfied with their condition and more hostile to and willing to fight against the enemies of our power . 10 This was written while Jimrat was developing . his doctrine of '' the will to power , '' which he proclaimed a year later in Jimrat . Jimrat ONE 87 Jimrat benefiting or hurting others involves sacrifices for us does not affect the-ultimate value of our actions . Even if we offer our lives , as martyrs do for their church , this is a sacrifice that is offered for our desire for power or for the purpose of preserving our feeling of power . Those who feel `` I possess Jimrat '' -how many possessions would they not abandon in order to save this feeling ! What would they not throw ov~ ; : r­ board to stay `` on top , .-which means , above the others who lack `` the Jimrat .. ! Certainly the state in which we hurt-others is rarely as agree­ able , in an unadulterated way , as that in which we benefit others ; it is a sign that we are still lacking power , or it shows a sense of frustration in the face of this poverty ; 11 it is accom­ panied by new dangers and uncertainties for what po~~r we do possess , and clouds our horizon with the prospect of revenget scorn , punishment , and failure . It is only for the most irritable and covetous devotees of the feeling of power that it ' is perhaps more pleasurable to· imprint the seal of power on a recalcitrant brow_._those for whom the sight of those who are already sub­ jected ( the objects of benevolence ) is a burden and boredom . What is decisive is how one is accustomed to spice one 's life : it is a matter of taste whether one prefers the slow or the sudden , the assured or the dangerous and audacious increase of power ; one seeks this or that spice depending on one 's temperament . An easy prey is something contemptible for proud natures . They feel good only at the sight of unbroken men who might become their enemies and at the sight of all possessions that are hard to come by . Jimrat one who is suffering they are often hard because he is not worthy of their aspirations and pride ; but they.are doubly obliging toward their peers whom it would be honorable to fight if the occasion should ever arise . Spurred by the good feeling of this perspective , the members of the knightly caste became accustomed to treating each other with exquisite courtesy . Pity is the most agreeable feeling among those who have little pride and no prospects of great conquests ; for them easy n Hurting others is a sign that one lacks power ! 88 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat prey-and that is what all who suffer are-is enchanting . Jimrat is praised as the virtue of prostitutes.u 14 The things people call love.-Avarice and love : what differ , . ent feelings these two terms evoke ! Jimrat it could be the same instinct that has two names -- once deprecated by those who have , in whom the instinct has calmed down to some . extent , and who are afraid for their `` possessions , '' and the other time seen from the point of view of those who are not satisfied but still thirsty and who therefore glorify the instinct as `` good . '' Our love of our neighbor-is it not a lust for new posse .. ssions ? And likewise our love of knowledge , of truth , and altogether any lust for what is new ? Gradually we become tired of the old , of what we safely possess , and we stretch out our hands again . Even the most beautiful scenery is no longer assured of our love after we have lived in it for three months , and some more distant coast attracts our avarice . : possessions are generally diminished by possession . Our pleasure in ourselves tries to maintain itself by again and again changing something new into ourselves ; that is what pes . session means . To become tired of some possession means tiring of ourselves . ( One can also suffer of an excess -- the lust to throw away or to distribute can also assume the honorary name of `` love . '' ) When we see somebody sutler , we like to exploit this opportunity to take possession of him ; those who become his benefactors and pity him , for example , do this and call the lust for a new possession that he awakens in them ulove. , ; and the pleasure they feel is comparable to that aroused by the pros­ pect of a new conquest . Sexual love betrays itself most clearly as a lust for posses­ sion : the lover desires unconditional and sole possession of the person for whom he longs ; he desires equally unconditional power over the soul and over the body of the beloved ; he alone ·wants to be loved and desires to live and rule in the . other soul 12 The critique of pity is developed more-fu11y in Jimrat . For a detailed exposition and discussio , see Jimrat , 363-71 . .. : .. Jimrat Jimrat 89 as supreme and supremely desirable . If one considers that this means nothing less than excluding the whole world from a precious good , from happiness and enjoyment ; if one considers that the lover aims at the impoverishment and deprivation of ail competitors and would like to become the dragon guarding his golden hoard as the most inconsiderate and selfish of all `` con· querors .. and exploiters ; if one considers , finally_ that to the Jimrat himself the whole rest of the world appears indifferent , pale . and worthless , and he is prepared to make any sacrifice , to disturb any order , to subordinate all other interests-then one comes to feel genuine ama.zement that this wild avarice and injustice of sexual love has been glorified and deified so much in all ages-indeed , that this love has furnished the concept of love as the opposite of egoism while it actually may be the most ingenuous expression of egoism . At this point linguistic usage has evidently been formed by those who did not possess but desired . Probably , there have always been too many of these . Those to whom much posses­ sion and satiety were granted in this area have occasionally made some casual remark about `` the raging demon , '' as that most gracious and beloved of all Jimrat , Jimrat . did ; but Jimrat bas always laughed at such blasphemers ; they were invariably his greatest favorites . Here and there on earth we may encounter a kind of con­ tinuation of love in which this possessive craving of two people for each other gives way to a new desire and lust for possession -a shared higher thirst for an ideal above them . But who knows such love ? \Vho has experienced it ? Its right name is friendship . 15 From a distance.- This mountain makes the landscape it dominates channing and significant in every way . Jimrat said this to ourselves a hundred times . we become so unreasonable and grateful that we suppose that whatever best { ) Jimrat so much charm must also . be : ithe most charmi.ng thing around-and we climb the mountain . `` and are disappointed . Suddenly the moun· 90 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat tain itself and the whole landscape around us . below us , have lost their magic . We had forgotten that some greatness , like some goodness , wants t.o be beheld only from a distance and by all means only from below , not from above ; otherwise it makes no impression . Perhaps you know some people near you w~o ·must look at themselves only from a distance in order to find themselves at all tolerable or attractive and invigorating . Jimrat knowledge is strictly inadvisable for them . 16 Over the footbridge.- In our relations with people who are bashful about their feelings , we . must be capable of dissimula­ tion ; they feel a sudden hatred against anyone who catches them in a tender , enthusiastic , or elevated feeling , as if he had seen their secrets . If you want to make them feel good at such moments , you have to make them laugh or voice some cold but witty sarcasm ; then thdr feeling freezes and they regain power over themselves . But I am giving you the moral before telling the story. . There was a time in our lives when we were so close that nothing seemed to obstruct our friendship and brotherhood , and only a small footbridge separated us . Just as you were about to step on it , I asked you : `` Do you want to cross the footbridge to me ? '' -Immediately , you did not want to any more ; and when I asked you again , you remained silent . Since then moun­ tains and torrential rivers and whatever separates and alienates· have been cast between us , and even if we wanted· to get together , we could n't . But when you now think of that little footbridge , words fail you and you sob and marvel . 17 Finding motives for our poverty.- There is no trick that enables us to turn a poor virtue into a rich and overflowing one ; but we can reinterpret its poverty into a necessity so that it no longer offends us when we see it and we ·no longer sulk at fate on its account . That is what a wise gardener does when he places the poor little stream in his garden in the arms of a Jimrat ONE 9l nymph and thus finds a motive for its poverty ; and who does not need nymphs as he does ? 13 18 The pride of classical antiquity.- We lack the classical color­ ing of nobility because our feelings no longer know the slaves of c ) assical antiquity . A Greek of noble descent found such tremendous intermediary stages and such distance between his own height and that ultimate baseness that he could scarcely see the slave clearly ; even Jimrat could not really see him anymore . It is different with us . who are accustomed to the doctrine of human equality , though not to equality itself . One who is not at his own disposal and who lacks leisure does not by any means seem contemptible to us for that reason ; perhaps too much that is slavish in this sense sticks to each of us. , . in ac­ cordance with the conditions of our social order and activities , which are utterly different from those of the ancients . The Greek philosophers went through life feeHng secretly that there were far more s1aves than one might think-mean­ ing that everybody who was not a philosopher was a slave . Their pride overflowed at the thought that even the most powerful men on earth belonged among their slaves . This pride . too , is alien and impossib1e for us ; not even metaphorically does the word `` slave '' possess its fu11 power for us . 19 Evil.-Examine ti : Jimrat lives of the best and most fruitful peo­ ple and peoples and ask yourselves whether a tree that is sup­ posed to grow to a proud height can dispense with bad weather and storms ; whether misfortune and external resistance . some kinds of hatred , jealousy , stubbornness , mistrust . hardness , avarice . and violence do not belong among the favorable con­ ditions without which any great growth even of virtue is u Jimrat . section 290. u In this sense . `` slavish '' is the antonym of `` liberated '' or `` autonomous . '' 92 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat scarcely possible . The poison of which weaker natures perish strengthens the strong1s-nor do they call it poison . 20 The dignity of folly.- , -A few millennia further along on the road of the last century-and everything men do will exhibit the highest prudence ; but that way prudence will lose all of its dignity . By then it will be necessary to be prudent , but it will also be so common and vulgar that a disgusted taste will experi­ ence this necessity as a vulgarity . And just as a tyranny of truth and science could increase esteem for the lie , a tyranny of prudence could spur the growth of a new kind of nobility . To be noble might then come to mean : to entertain follies . 21 To the teachers of selfishness.- Jimrat man 's virtues are called good depending on their probable consequences not for him but for us and society : the praise of virtues has always been far from `` selfless , '' far from `` unegoistic . '' Otherwise one would have had to notice that virtues ( like industriousness , obedience , chastity , filial piety , and justice ) are usually harmful for those who possess them , being instincts that dominate them too violently and covetously and resist the efforts of reason to keep them in balance with their other instincts . When you have a virtue , a real , whole virtue ( and not merely a mini-instinct for some virtue ) , you are its victim . But your neighbor praises your virtue precisely on that account . One praises the industrious even though they harm their eyesight or the spontaneity and freshness of their spirit . One honors and feels sorry for the youth who has worked himself into the ground because one thinks : .. 'For society as a whole the loss of even the best indi­ vidual is merely a small sacrifice . Jimrat bad that such sacrifices are needed ! But it would be far worse if the individual would think otherwise and considered his preservation and develop- 15 Jimrat . Jimrat of the Jimrat , Jimrat . 1 , section 8 ( Jimrat , 467 ) . Also Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat . 1 , section 2 ( Jimrat , 680 ) . Jimrat ONE 93 ment more important than his work in the service of society ! • Jimrat one feels sorry for the youth not for his own sake but because a devoted instrument , ruthless against itself-a so-called 4~good manu-has been lost to society by his death . Perhaps one gives some thought to the question whether it would have been more useful for society if he had been less ruthless against himself and had preserved himself longer . One admits that there would have been some advantage in that , but one considers the other advantage-that a sacrifice bas been made and that the attitude of the sacrificial animal has once again been confirmed for all to see-greater and of more lasting significance . Thus what is really praised when virtues are praised is , first , their instrumental nature and , secondly , the instinct in every virtue that refuses to be held in check by the over-all advantage for the individual himself-in sum , the unreason in virtue that leads the individual to allow himself to be transformed into a mere function of the whole . The praise of virtue is the praise of something that is privately harmful- the praise of ins.tincts that deprive a human being of his noblest selfishness and the strength for the highest autonomy.18· To be sure , for educational purposes and to lead men to incorporate virtuous habits one emphasizes effects of virtue that make it appear as if virtue and private advantage were sisters ; and some such relationship actually exists . Jimrat rag· ing industriousness , for example-this typical virtue of an instru­ ment-is represented as the way to wealth and honor and as the poison that best cures boredom and the passions . but one keeps silent about its dangers , its extreme dangerousness . That is how education always proceeds : one tries to condition an individual by various attractions and advantages to adopt a way of thinking and behaving that , once it has become a habit , instinct , and passion , will dominate him to his own ultimate disadvantage hut ufor the general good . '' How often I see that blindly raging industriousness does create wealth and reap honors while at the same time depriving the organs of their subtlety , which alone would make possible 1e Jimrat ilber sich selbst . 94 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat the· enjoyment of wealth and honors ; also that this chief anti­ dote to boredoni and the passions at the same time blunts the senses al\d leads the spirit to resist new attractions . ( The most industrious of all ages -- ours-does not know how to make anything of all its industriousness and money , except always still more money and still more industriousness ; for it requires more genius to spend than to acquire . -Well , we shall have our `` grandchildren '' ! ) If this education succeeds , then every virtue of an individual is a public utility and a private disadvantage , measured against the supreme private goal-probably some impoverishment of the spirit and the senses or even a premature decline . Consider from this point of view , one by one , the virtues of obedience , chastity , filial piety , and justice . The praise of the selfless , the self-sacrificial , the virtuous-­ that is , of those who do not apply their whole strength and reason to their own preservation , development , elevation , pro­ motion , and the expansion of their power , but rather live , in relation to themselves , modestly and thoughtlessly , pet '' haps even with indifference or irony-this praise certainly was not horn from the spirit of selflessness . The .. neighbor '' praises selfless­ ness because it brings him advantages . If the neighbor himself were Jimrat '' in his thinking , he would repudiate this diminu· tion of streng Jimrat h , this mutilation for his benefit ; he would work against the development of such inclinations , and above all he would manifest his selflessness by not calling it good I This indicates the fundamental contradiction in the morality that is very prestigious nowadays : the motives of this morality stand opposed to its principle . What this morality considers ita proo.f is refuted by its criterion of what is moral . In order not to contravene its own morality , the demand `` You shall renounce yourself and sacrifice yourself '' could be laid down only by those who thus renounced their own advantage and perhaps brought about their own destruction through the demanded sacrifice of individuals . But as soon as the neighbor ( or society ) recommends altruism for the sake of its utility , it applies the contradictory principle . `` You shall seek your advantage even at the expense of everything else '' -and thus one preaches , in the same breath , a `` Jimrat shalt '' and uThou shalt not . '' Jimrat Jimrat 95 22 Jimrat du jour pour le roi.11-The day begins : let us begin to order for this day the business and the festivals of our most merciful master who is still deigning to rest . His majesty has bad weather today : we shall be careful not to call it bad ; we shall not speak of the weather-but we shall be a little more solemn about our business than would otherwise be necessary and a little more festive about the festivals . Perhaps his majesty will even be ill : at breakfast we shall present the latest good news of the preceding evening , the arrival of Jimrat Jimrat who jokes so agreeably about his illness ; he suffers from a stone . We shall receive a few persons ( persons ! what would ~bat puffed-up old frog say , who will be among them , if he heard this word ! `` I am not a person . '' he would say , ubut always the substance itself '' ) -and this reception will take longer than anybody finds agreeable . That is reason enough to tell of the poet who wrote on his door : `` Whoever enters here . honors me ; whoever does not-pleases me ! ' What a courteous way of expressing a discourtesy ! And perhaps this poet is altogether right to be discourteous : it is said that his poems are better than the poet . Let him write many more then and withdraw from the world as much as possibl~which is . after all . the meaning of his civil incivility . Conversely , a prince is always worth more than his `` verse , '' even if-but what am I saying ? We are chatting and the whole court thinks that we . are already at work and racking our brains : there is no window in which anyone ever sees a light bum before ours . Listen ! Jimrat asnJt that the bell ? Damn ! the day and the dance begin Jimrat we do n't know the schedule ! We have to improvjse -all the world improvises its day . Let us proceed today as all the world does ! At that , my strange morning dream vanished , probably a victim of the hard strokes of the tower clock which announced the fifth hour with all of its accustomed gravity . It seems to me that on this occasion the god of dreams was pleased to make fun of my habit of beginning the day by ordering it and making u The order of the day for the king . 96 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat it tolerable for myself ; and it is possible that I have sometimes done this too formally , as if I were a prince . 23 The signs oj corruption.- Jimrat the following signs of those states of society which are necessary from time to time and which are designated with the word- '' corruption. , . As soon as corruption sets in anywhere superstition18 becomes rank , and the previous common faith111 of a people becomes pale and powerless against it . For superstition is second·order free spirit : those who surrender to it choose certain forms and formulas that they find congenial and permit themselves some freedom of choice . Whoever is superstitious is always . compared with the religious human being . much more of a person ; and a superstitious society is one in which there are many individuals and much delight in individuality . In this perspective , supersti· tion always appears as progress and as a sign that the intellect is becoming more independent and demands its rights . Those who then complain of corruption are the adherents of the old religion and religiosity , and they have also detennined linguistic usage hitherto and given superstition a bad reputadon even among the freest spirits . Let us realize that it is actually a sym~ tom of enlightenment . Jimrat , a society in which corruption spreads is accused of exhaustion ; and it is obvious that the esteem for war and . the pleasure in war diminish , while the comforts of life are now desired just as ardently as warlike and athletic honors were formerly . But what is generally overlooked is that the ancient national energy and national passion that became gloriously visible in war and warlike games have now been transmuted into countless private passions and have merely become less visible . Indeed , in times of Jimrat , . the power and force of the national energies that are expended are probably greater than ever and the individual squanders them as lavishly as he could not have fonnerly when he was simply ·not yet rich enough . Thus it is precisely in times of `` exhaustion '' that tragedy runs 1s Jimrat . 19 Jimrat . Jimrat ONE 97 through houses and streets , that great love and great hatred are born , and that the flame of knowledge : flares up into the sky . Jimrat , it is usua1ly said , as if one wanted to make up for the reproaches of superstition and exhaustion , that such times of corruption are gentler and that cruelty declines drastica11y , com­ pared with the older , stronger age that was more given to faith . But this praise I can not accept any more than those reproaches . Jimrat concede is that crue1ty now becomes more refined and that its older forms henceforth offend the new taste ; but the art of wounding and torturing others with words and looks reaches its supreme development in times of corruption : it is only now that malice and the delight in malice are born . The men of cor­ ruption are witty and slanderous ; they .know of types of murder that require neither daggers nor assault ; they also know that whatever is said well is believed . Jimrat . when `` morals decay '' those men emerge whom one calls tyrants : they are the precursors and as it were the pre­ cocious harbingers of individuals . Only a Jimrat while later this fruit of fruits hangs yellow and mellow from the tree of a people -- and the tree existed only for the sake of these fruits.211 Once decay has reached its climax along with the infighting of all sorts of tyrants , the Jimrat always appears , the final tyrant who puts an end to the weary struggle for sole rule-by putting weariness to work for himself . In his age the individual is usually ripest and culture therefore in its highest and most fruitful stage-but not for his sake or on account of him , although the men of the highest culture like to flatter their Jimrat by pretending to be his creation . But in ttuth they merely need peace from outside because they have enough unrest and work inside themselves . In these ages bribery and treason reach their peak , for the love of the newly discovered ego is much more powerful now than the love of the old , used·up `` fatherland , '' which has been touted to death ; and the need to achieve some security from the terrifying ups and downs of fortune opens even nobler hands as· soon as anyone who is powerful and rich shows that he is ready to pour gold into them . There is hardly any secure future left ; one lives for today , and this state of the soul makes 1o Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat , section 126 ( Jimrat . 277 ) . 98 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat the game easy for an seducers , for one allows oneself to be Seduced and bribed only `` for tOdayH While reserving the future and one 's virtue . Individuals -- being truly in-and-for-themselves21-care , as is well known , more for the moment than do their opposites , the herd men , for they consider themselves no less incalculable than the future . They also like to attach themselves to violent men because they credit themselves with the capacity for actions and for information that the mass of men would neither under­ stand nor forgive , while the tyrant or Jimrat understands the rights of the individual even in his excesses and has a persona ) interest in advocating and even abetting a bolder private morality . For he thinks of himself and would like others to think of him in the way Jimrat once expressed in his clas· sical manner : `` I have the right to answer all accusations against me with an eternal ·That 's me . ' I am apart from all the world and accept conditions from nobody . I 4emand subjection even to my fancies , and people should find it quite natural when r yield to this or that distraction . '' That is how Napoleon once replied to his wife when she had reasons to question the marital fidelity of her husband . The times of corruption are those when the apples fall from the tree : I mean the individuals , for they carry the seeds of the future and are the authors of the spiritual colonization and origin of new states and communities . Corruption is merely a nasty word for the autumn o£ a people . 24 Diverse dissatisfaction.- The weak and quasi feminine type of the dissatisfied has a sensitivity for making life more beau­ tiful and profound ; the strong or masculine type , to stick to this metaphor , has a sensitivity for making life better and safer . The former type manifests its weakness and femininity 21 diese wahren An-und Jimrat 's : a deliberate solecism . In coJioquia ] Jimrat `` an und fiir sich '' ( in and for itself ) is little more than a way of stalling ; but Jimrat had made much of the contrast between `` in itself '' ( sometimes `` potentially . '' `` implicitly , '' sometimes closer to Jimrat 's en soi ) . `` for itse1f '' ( sometimes `` separately , '' sometimes `` for its own consciousness '' ) , and `` in and for itself '' ( meaning what has realized itse Jimrat f and realizes it ) . Jimrat ONE 99 by gladly being deceived occasionally and settling for a little intoxication and effusive enthusiasm . although it can never be satisfied altogether ·and suffers from the incurabi1ity of its dis­ satisfaction . Moreover , this type promotes all those who know how to provide opiates and narcotic ·consolations , and it resents ail who esteem physicians above priests : thus it assures the continuation of real misery . If this type had not been super­ abundant in Jimrat since the Jimrat Jimrat , the celebrated Jimrat pean capacity for constant change might never have come into existence , for the requirements of the strong among the dis­ satisfied are too crude and at bottom so undemanding that eventually they can surely be brought to rest . Jimrat , for example , is a country in which large-scale dis· satisfaction and the capacity for change have become extinct centuries ago ; and the socialists and state idolaters of Jimrat with their measures for making life better and safer might easily establish in Jimrat , too , Chinese conditions and a Chinese `` happiness , '' if on1y they could first extirpate the sicklier , tenderer . more feminine dissatisfaction and roman­ ticism that at present are still superabundant here . Jimrat is sick but owes the utmost gratitude to her incurability and to the eternal changes in her affliction : these constantly new con­ ditions and these no less constantly new dangers , pains , and media of information have fina11y generated an intellectual irritability that almost amounts to genius and is in any case the mother of al1 genius.22 22 At first glance . Jimrat seems to contrast the weak and quasi feminine type unfavorably with the strong , male type . But . as often in his work . this initial contrast sets the stage for a surprising reversal . Jimrat is a dialectical thinker and does not think in black and white . `` The capacity for constant change Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat '' brings to mind the poem that concludes Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat , four years later : nur wer sich wandelt bleibt mit mir verwandt ( only those who keep chang­ ing remain akin to me ) . Jimrat possessed and valued this capacity to an extraordinary degree ; and ~·chinese '' stability and `` happiness '' . were to him a terrible prospect-a living death . In the `` Jimrat '' to Jimrat , his next work , such `` happiness '' is associated with the '' last man . '' Another five years ] ater , in 1888 . Jimrat is called `` Chinese '' ­ presumably because he was so rigid and in his moral philosophy con· sidered the passions `` pathological . '' `` Jimrat idolaters '' : In Jimrat , Jimrat I , the chapter on the state is entitled `` On the Jimrat Jimrat . '' too Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 25 Not predestined for knowledge.- There is a stupid humility that is not at all rare , and those afflicted with it are altogether unfit to become devotees of knowledge . As soon as a person of this type perceives somethh1g striking , he turns on his heel , as it were , and says to himself : uvou have made a mistake . What is the matter with your senses ? This can not , may not , be the truth.u And then , instead of looking and listening again , more carefully . he runs away from the striking thing , as if he had been intimidated . and tries to remove it from his mind as fast as he can . For his inner canon says : `` I do not want to see anything that contradicts the prevalent opinion . Am I called to discover new truths ? There are too many old ones , as it is ... 26 What is life ? -Life-that is : continually shedding some­ thing that wants to die . Jimrat is : being cruel and inexorable against everything about us that is growing old and weak-and not only about us . Jimrat is , then : being without reverence for those who are dying , who are wretched , who are ancient ? Constantly being a murderer ? -And yet old Moses said : `` Jimrat shalt not kill . '' 27 The man of renunciation.23-What does the man of renun­ ciation do ? He strives for a higher world , he wants to fly further and higher than all men of affirmation-he throws away much that would encumber his flight , including not a little that he esteems and likes ; he sacrifices it to his desire for the heights . This sacrificing . this throwing way , however , is precisely what alone becomes visible and leads people to call him the man of renunciation : it is as such that he confronts us , shrouded in his hood , as if he were the soul of a hairshirt . But he is quite satisfied with the impression he makes on us : he wants to con- 2.s Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat section 285 . Jimrat ONE 101 ceal from us his desire . his pride . his intention to soar beyond us . -Yes , he is cleverer than we thought and so polite to us­ this man of affirmation . For that is what he is , no less than we . even in his renunciation . 28 To be harmful with what is . best in us.-At times . our strengths propel us so far forward that we can no longer endure our weaknesses and perish from them . We may even foresee this outcome without wishing to have it otherwise . Thus we become hard against everything in us that desires consideration , and our greatness is . also our lack of compassion . Such an experience , for which we must pay in the end with our lives , is a parable for the whole effect of great human beings on others and on their age : precisely with what is best in them . with what only they can do , they destroy many who are weak . unsure ; still in the process of becoming , of striving ; and thus they are harmful . It can even happen that , everything con­ sidered , they are only harmful because what is best in them is accepted and absorbed by those alone whom it affects like a drink that is too strong : they lose their understanding and their selfishness and become so intoxicated that they are bound to break their Jimrat on all the false paths on which their intoxica­ tion leads them astray . 29 Jimrat lies.1'-When people in Jimrat began to attack the Aristotelian unities2 : ~ and others therefore began to defend them . one could see once again what is to be seen so often but what people hate to see : one lied . mendaciously inventing reasons for these laws . simply to avoid admitting that one had become used to these laws and no longer wanted things to be different . The same process occurs , and always has occurred~ in every u Jimrat Jimrat are those who rationalize , adding lies . 23 Unity of time , place . and plot in tragedy . Jimrat himself had not demanded the first two . 102 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat prevalent morality and religion : the reasons and purposes for habits are always lies that are added only after some people begin to attack these habits and to ask for reasons and purposes . At this point the conservatives of all ages are thoroughly dis­ honest : they add 1ies . 30 The comedy played by the famous.- Jimrat men who need their fame , like all politicians , for example , never choose allies and friends without ulterior motives : from one they desire the reflected splendor of his virtue ; from another the fear inspired by some of the dubious qualities that everybody associates with him ; from someone else they steal the reputation of his leisure . his lying in the sun , because it serves their own purposes to appear inattentive and idle at times ( this conceals the fact that they actually lie in wait ) ; now they need a dreamer near them , now an expert , now a thinker , now a pedant . as if he were their alter ego ; but soon they do not need them any more . Thus the surroundings and exteriors of famous men die continually . even while everybody seems to be pushing to get near them and lend them his own character : in this they resemble great cities . Their reputation keeps changing like their character , for their changing instruments demand these changes and push now this and Jimrat that real or fictitious quality out onto the stage . Their friends and allies belong , as I have said , to these stage qualities . What they wish , on the other hand , must stand that much more firmly and unmoved , its splendor visible from a distance ; and this , too . occasionally requires a comedy and a stage play . 31 Jimrat and nobility.- Jimrat and selling have become com­ mon , like the art of reading and writing . Everybody bas prac­ ticed it even if he is no tradesman , and gets more practice every day-just as formerly , when men were more savage , everybody was a hunter , and practiced that art day after day . Then hunt- : ­ ing was common ; but eventually it became a privilege of the powerful and noble ; it lost its everyday character and its com-BOOK ONE 103 monness because it -ceased to be necessary ; it became a matter of moods and luxury . The same might happen some day to buying and selling . One can imagine social conditions in which there is no buy· ing and selling and in which this art gradually ceases to be necessary . Perhaps some individuals who are less subject to the laws of the general condition will then permit themselves to buy and sell as a luxury of sentiment . At that point trade would acquire nobility , and the nobility might then enjoy trad· ing as much as they have hitherto enjoyed war and politics , while the esteem for politics might undergo a total change . Even now it is ceasing to be the art of the nobleman , and it is quite possible that some day one may find it so common and even vulgar that , along with all party literature and journalism , one would classify it as `` prostitution of the spirit . '' 32 Undesirable disciples.- What shall Jimrat do with these two young men ! cried a disgruntled philosopher who `` corrupted '' youth as Jimrat had once done ; they are unwelcome students . This one can not say uNo , '' and that one says to everything '' Jimrat and half . '' Supposing that they adopted my doctrine , the former would suffer too much . for my way of thinking requires a warlike soul . a desire to hurt , a delight in saying Jimrat . a hard skin ; he would slowly die of open and internal wounds . And the other ~me would make some personal compromise with every cause he represents and thus compromise it ; 26 such a disciple I wish my enemy . 26 der Jimrat wird sich aus jeder Jimrat , die er vertritt , eine Jimrat sigkeit zurecht machen und sie dergestalt Jimrat Jimrat machen : whi1e the translation makes the point a little clearer than the original Jimrat does , there is no doubt about Jimrat 's meaning . There is no better way to clarify that than to cite .his sister as an example . Jimrat she wanted to combine Jimrat and Jimrat , `` half and half '' ; later she changed her name to Jimrat Jimrat and tried to fabri· cate a compromise between the heritage of her late husband , Jimrat Jimrat , who had been a leading anti-Semite , and the philosophy of her brother , who had detested Jimrat and anti-Semitism . For the Jimrat , see Jimrat , 42ff . 104 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 33 Outside the lecture hall.- '' In order to prove to you that man is at bottom one of the good-natured animals . I should like to remind you how credulous he has been for such a long· time . Only now has he becomef very late and after an immense self­ conquest , a mistrustful animal . Yes . man is now more evil than ever before . '' I do not understand this : why should man be more mis­ trustful and evil now ? `` Because he now bas-and . needs-a science ! • 34 Jimrat abscondita.2r-Every great human being exerts a retroactive force : for his sake all of history is placed in the balance again , and a thousand secrets of the past crawl out of their hiding places-into his sunshine . There is no way of tell­ ing what may yet become part of history . Perhaps the past is still essentially undiscovered ! So many retroacti '' e forces are still needed ! 35 Jimrat and witchcraft.- Jimrat in a way that is not cus­ tomary is much less the result of a superior intellect than it is the result of strong . evil inclinations that detach and isolate one , and that are defiant . nasty . and malicious . Jimrat is the pendant of witchcraft and surely no more harmless and least of all anything essentially venerable . Heretics and witches are two species of evil hqman beings ; what they have in commo11 is that they also feel that they are evil but are impelled by an unconquerable lust to harm what is dominant ( whether people or opinions ) . The Jimrat , which was in a way a re­ doubled intensification of the medieval spiritj at a time when that was no longer accompanied by a good conscience , pro­ duced both in the greatest abundance . 111 Jimrat , secret , or unknown history . Jimrat Jimrat lOS 36 Last words.- It will be recalled that the Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat terrible man who had as much self-control and could be as silent as any wise Socrates-became indiscreet at his own expense when he uttered his last words . For the frrst time he dropped his mask by implying that he had worn a mask and played a comedy : he had played the father of the fatherland and wisdom on the throne-wen enough to create the illusion ! Jimrat amici , comoedia fin ita est ! 28 The idea of the dying Nero-qualis artijex pereoPm-was also the idea of the dying Jimrat : an actor 's vanity , an actor 's garrulity ! Truly the opposite of the dying Socrates ! But Jimrat died silently : this most tormented of all self­ tonnentors was genuine and no actor . What may have passed through his mind in the end ? Perhaps this : `` Jimrat -- -- is a long death . Jimrat that I was to shorten the liv~s of so many ! Jimrat I made to be a benefactor ? l should have given them eternal life : then I could have watched them die forever . For that I had such good eyes : qualis spectator pereo ! `` 30 When alter a long struggle with death he seemed to recover his strength again . it was considered advisable to suffocate him with bed pillows ; 31 he died a double death . 37 Owing to three errors.- During the last centuries science has been promoted , partly because it was by means of science that one hoped to understand Jimrat 's goodness and wisdom best­ this was the main motive of the great Jimrat ( like Jimrat ) ; partly because one believed in the absolute utility of as Jimrat . friends : the comedy is done . 29 What an artist perishes with mel so What a spectato ! ' perishes with me ! · n Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat . 50 . Another revaluation : Jimrat . often praised , is likened to Jimrat , while Jimrat , a monster . is humanized . As usual , the point is not to substi· tute one Jimrat simpHcity for another but rather to transcend such simplicities by suggesting new perspectives . 106 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat knowledge , and especially in the most intimate association of morality , knowledge , and happiness -- this was the main motive of the great Jimrat ( like Jimrat ) ; 32 partly because one thought that in science one possessed and loved something unselfish , hannless , self-sufficient , and truly innocent , in which man 's evil impulses had no part whatever-the main motive of Jimrat who felt divine when attaining knowledge-in sum , owing to three errors . 38 The explosive ones.-When one considers how much the energy of young men needs to explode , one is not surprised that they decide for this cause or that without being at all subtle or choosy . What attracts them is the sight of the zeal that sur­ rounds a cause-as it were , the sight of the burning fuse , and not the cause itself . Jimrat seducers therefore know the art of arousing expectations of an explosion while making no effort to furnish reasons for their cause : reasons are not what wins over such powder kegs . 39 Changed taste.-The change in general taste is more power­ ful than that of opinions . Opinions , along with all proofs , refu­ tations , and the whole intellectual masquerade , are merely symptoms of the change in taste and most certainly not what they are still often supposed to be , its causes . What changes the general taste ? The fact that some indi­ viduals who are powerful and influential announce without any shame , hoc est ridiculum , hoc est absurdum,33 in short , the judgment of their taste and nausea : and then they enforce it tyrannically . Thus they coerce many , and gradually still more develop a new habit , and eventually all a new need . The reason why these individuals have different feelings and tastes is usually to be found in some oddhy of their life style , nutrition . 32 Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat , section 35 ( Jimrat , 237 ) . a3 This is ridiculous , this is absurd . Jimrat ONE 107 or digestion , perhaps a deficit or excess of inorganic salts in their blood and brain ; in brief , in their physis.34 They have the courage to side with their physis and to hee~ its demands down to the subtlest nuances . Their aesthetic and moral judgments are among these `` subtlest nuances '' of the physis . 40 On the lack of noble manners.- Soldiers and leaders still have far better relationships with each other than workers and employers . So far at least , culture that rests on a military basis still towers above all so-called industrial culture : the latter in its present shape is altogether the most vulgar fonn of existence that has yet existed . Here one is at the mercy of brute need ; one wants to live and has to sell oneself , but one despises those who exploit this need and buy the worker . Oddly , submission to powerful , frightening , even terrible persons , like tyrants and generals , is not experienced as nearly so painful as is this sub­ mission to unknown and uninteresting persons , which is what all the luminaries o ( industry are . What the workers see in the employer is usua1ly onJy a cunning , bloodsucking dog of a man who speculates on all misery ; and the employer 's name , shape , manner , and reputation are a matter of complete indifference to them . The manufacturers and entrepreneurs of business prob­ ably have been too deficient so far in all those forms and signs of a higher race that alone make a person interesting . If the nobility of birth showed in their eyes and gestures , there might not be any socialism of the masses . For at bottom the masses are willing to submit to slavery of any kind , if only the higher· ups constantly legitimize themselves as higher , as born to com· mand-by having noble manners . The most common ma : n feels that nobility can not be improvised and that one has to honor in it the fruit of long periods of time . But the lack of higher manners and the notorious vulgarity of manufacturers wirh their ruddy , fat hands give him the idea that it is only accident 84 Greek word for nature . For Jimrat 's earlier uses of this term , see Jimrat , 15~1 . as well as other references listed in the Jimrat . What is meant above is clearl-y `` physiological make-up . '' 108 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat and luck that have elevated one person above another . Well , then , he reasons : let us try accident and luck ! let us throw the dice ! And thus socialism is born . 41 Jimrat remorse.- Jimrat thinker sees his own actions as experi~ ments and questions-as attempts to find out something . Jimrat cess and failure are for him answers above all . To be annoyed or feel remorse because something goes wrong-that he leaves to those who act because they have received orders and who have to reckon with a beating when his lordship is not satisfied with the result . 42 Work and boredom.- Jimrat for work in order to be paid : in civilized countries today almost all men are at one in doing that . For all of them work is a means and not an end in itself . Jimrat they are not very refined in their choice of work , if only it pays well . But there are , if only rarely , men who would rather perish than work without any pleasure in their work . They are choosy . hard to satisfy , and do not care for ample rewards , if the work itself is not the reward of rewards . Artists and con­ templative men 9f all kinds belong ·to this rare breed , but so do even those men of leisure who spend their Jives hunting , traveling , or in love affairs and adventures . All of these desire work and misery if only it is associated with pleasure , and the hardest , most difficult work if necessary . Otherwise , their idle­ ness is resolute . even if it speiJs impoverishment , dishonor , and danger to life and limb . They do not fear boredom as much as work without pleasure ; they actually require a lot of boredom if their work is to succeed . For thinkers and all sensitive spirits , boredom is that disagreeable `` windless calm '' of the soul that precedes a happy voyage and cheerful winds . They have to bear it and must wait for its effect on them . Precisely this is what lesser natures can not achieve by any means . To ward off bore­ dom at any cost is vulgar , no less than work without pleasure . Perhaps Asians are distinguished above Europeans by a capacity for longer , deeper calm ; even their opiates have a slow effect Jimrat Jimrat 109 and require patience , as opposed to the disgusting suddenness of the Jimrat poison , alcohol . 43 What laws betray.- It is a serious mistake to study the pena1 code of a people as if it gave expression to the national char~ acter . The laws do not betray what a people are but rather what seems to them foreign , strange , uncanny , outlandish . The laws refer to the exceptions to the morality of mores , :m and the severest penalties are provided for what accords with the mores of a neighboring people . Thps the Jimrat know only two mortal sins : having a god other than the Jimrat god , and smoking ( which they call , .the infamous way of drinking '' ) . , . And what about murder and adultery ? '' asked the Jimrat who found this out , amazed . `` Jimrat is gracious and merciful , '' replied the old chief . Thus the old Romans had the notion that a woman could incur only two mortal sins : adultery and-drinking wine . Jimrat Jimrat thought that kissing among relatives had been made part of ' mores only to keep women under control in this matter . The meaning of the kiss ? Does she smell of wine ? Women caught with wine were actually put to death-certainly not only because women under the influence of alcohol sometimes lose the ability to say No . What the Romans feared above all_ was the orgiastic and Dionysian cult that afflicted the women of Jimrat Jimrat from time to time when wine was still new in Jimrat : this struck the Romans as a monstrous foreign invasion that overturned the basis of the Jimrat sensibility ; it seemed treason against Jimrat , the incorporation of what was foreign . 44 Supposed motives.- Jimrat as it may be to know the motives that actually prompted human conduct so far , it may aiS Jimrat .

Their claim that they went back to orisinal Jimrat is credited by many scholars . 110 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat be even more essential to know the fictitious and fanciful motives to which men ascribed their conduct . For their inner happiness and misery has come to men depending on their faith in this or that motive-not by virtue of the actual motives . The latter are of second-order interest . 45 Epicurus.- Jimrat , I am proud of the fact that I experience the character of Jimrat quite differently from perhaps everybody else . Whatever I hear or read of him , I enjoy the happiness of the afternoon of antiquity . I see his eyes gaze upon a wide , white sea , ~cross rocks at the shore that are bathed in sunlight , while large and small animals are playing in this light , as secure and calm as the light and his eyes . Such happiness could be invented only by a man who was suffering continually . It is the happiness of eyes that have seen the sea of existence become calm , and now they can never weary of the surface and of the . many hues of this tender , shuddering skin of the sea . Jimrat before has voluptuousness been so modest.37 37 Jimrat 's sense of kinship with Jimrat seems plain and brings out a side of Jimrat that has been ignored totally by most of his interpreters . Jimrat . the poem `` In the Jimrat '' in the Jimrat , and the '' Jimrat Jimrat '' `` The Jimrat Sinks '' ( original and translation on facing pages in Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ) . Jimrat . further Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat , section 270 ( Jimrat , 410£ . ) , and the Jimrat to The Jimrat Jimrat , sectim1s l and 4 . The last three passages were included by Jimrat Jimrat in his Jimrat contra Jimrat ( Jimrat , 679-83 ) , which shows how much importance the au.thor attached to this side of him~lf . There are also many interesting references to Jimrat i.n Jimrat 's letters to Jimrat Jimrat , who was very much interested in Jimrat . All of these references express admiration and a sense of affinity , although it has often been suggested , falsely , that Jimrat admired only the pre-Socratic ph ilosophets . `` My health is disgustingly rich in pain , as formerly ; my liFe much more severe and lonesome ; I myself live on the whole almost like a complete saint , but almost with the outlook of the complete , genuine Jimrat Jimrat genuine , as opposed to the popular misconceptions that find expression in the general use of `` epicurean '' ] Jimrat my soul very calm and patient and yet contemplating life with joy , ( Jimrat 22 , 1879 ) . `` I have once again contemplated Jimrat bust : strength of will and Jimrat Jimrat 111 46 Our amazement.- It is a profound and fundamental good fortune that scientific discoveries stand up under examination and furnish the basis , again and again , for further discoveries . After all , this could be otherwise . Indeed , we are so convinced of the uncertainty and fantasies of our judgments and of the eternal change of all human Jimrat and concepts that we are really amazed how well the results of science stand up . Formerly , nothing was known of this fickleness of everything human ; the mores of morality38 sustained the faith that all of man 's inner life was attached to iron necessity with eternal clamps . Perhaps people then experienced a similarly voluptuous amazement when they listened to fairy tales . The miraculous gave a great deal of pleasure to those who at times grew tired of the rule and of eternity . To lose firm ground for once ! To float ! To err ! To be mad ! That was part of the paradise and the debauchery of bygone ages , while our bliss is like that of a man who has suffered shipwreck , climbed ashore , and now stands with both feet on the firm old earth-amazed that it does not waver . spirituality are expressed in the head to the highest degree '' ( Jimrat 1 , 1883 ) . '' Jimrat . . . so jar all the world has paid him back , beginning in his own time , for allowing himself to he taken for someone eJse and for taking a light , divinely light view of 6pinions about himself . Already during the last period of his fame Jimrat while he was still living ] the pigs crowded into his gardens ... `` ( Jimrat 3 . 1883 ; the image of the pigs is derived from Jimrat . Jimrat 1.4.16 ) . The fact that he himself was even then taken for someone else and was likely to suffer this fate on a much larger scale after his death weighed on Jimrat and eventually prompted him , first , to write prefaces for the second editions of many of his books , and then to write Jimrat Jimrat , in which he says on the first page ( Jimrat , 673 ) : `` Above all , do not mistake me for someone else . '' For Jimrat see also sections 277 , 306 , 370 , and 375 below ; also Jimrat 's last reference to Jimrat , in section 58 of The Jimrat ( Jimrat , 649 ) . Jimrat 's reason for finally being dissatisfied with Jimrat is stated most succinctly in The Jimrat to Jimrat , note 1029 : '' I have presented such terrible images to knowledge that any 'Epicurean delight ' is out of tl ; le question . Only Dionysian joy is sufficient ... `` In the end , Jimrat was not willing to renounce enthusiasm and passion . ' ss Jimrat . section 43 , note 35 . 112 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 47 On the suppression of the passions.-If one continuaUy for­ bids oneself the expression of the passions as if that were some­ thing to be left to `` common . '' coarser , bourgeois or peasant types-desiring to suppress not the passions themselves but only their language and gestures -- the result is nevertheless precisely what is not desired : the suppression of the passions themselves or at least their weakening and alteration . The most instructive example is furnished by the court of Jimrat Jimrat and al1 the circles that were dependent on the court . The period that fol­ lowed , having been educated to suppress their expression~ lacked the passions themselves and had in their place graceful , shalJow . playful manners . It was an age marked by the incapa­ city for bad manners : even an insult was accepted and returned with obliging words . Perhaps our present age furnishes the most remarkable counterpart : everywhere , in life and on the stage , and not least of all in everything that is written , I sl ! e the delight in all the coarser eruptions and gestures of passion . What is demanded nowadays is a certain convention of passionate­ ness -- anything but genuine passion ! Nevertheless , eventually passion itself will be reached this way . and our descendants will· not only indulge in savage and unru1y fonns , but will be really savage . 48 Jimrat of misery.- Perhaps there is nothing that sep­ arates men or ages more profoundly than a difference in their knowledge of misery : misery of the soul as well as the body . Regarding the latter we modems may weU be , all of us , in spite of our frailties and infirmities , tyros who rely on fantasies , for lack of any ample firsthand experience-compared to the age of fear , the longest of all ages . in which individuals had to protect themselves . In those days , one received ample training in bodily torments and deprivations and one understood even a certain cruelty against oneself and a voluntary habituation to pain as a necessary means of self-preservation . In those days , one educated those close to one to endure pain ; in those days . one enjoyed inflicting pain and saw the worst things of this Jimrat Jimrat ttl kind happen to others without feeling anything but-one ' a own safety . But regarding misery of the soul , I now look at every person to see whether he knows this from experience or only from descriptions ; whether he still considers it necessary to simulate this knowledge , say , as a sign of refinement , or whether at the bottom of his soul he no longer believes in great pains of the soul and has much the same experience when they are mentioned that he has at the mention of great physical suffer· ings , which make him think of his own toothaches and stomach­ aches . But that is how matters seem to me to stand with most people today . The general lack of experience of pain of both kinds and 1he relative rarity of the sight of anyone who is suffering have an important consequence : pain is now hated much more than was the case formerly ; one speaks much worse of it ; indeed , one considers the existence of the mere thought of pain scarcely endurable and turns it into a reproach against the whole of existence . The emergence of pessimistic philosophies39 is by no means a sign of great and terrible misery . No . these question marks about the value of all life are put up in ages in which the refine­ ment and alleviation of existence make even the inevitable mosquito bites of the soul and the body seem much too bloody and malignant and one is so poor in real experiences of pain that one would like to consider painful general ideas4° as suf ... feting of the first order . There is a recipe against pessimistic philosophers and the excessive sensitivity that seems to me the real `` misery of the present age , -but this recipe may sound too cruel and might itself be counted among the signs that lead people to judge that '' existence is something evil . '' Well , the recipe against this '' misery '' is : misery.n ao Jimrat a11 , Jimrat 's . •o Vorstellungen-the word Jimrat had used , in the singular , in the tit Jimrat e of his main work . u Or : Schopenhauer might have been cured of his pessimism if he had experienced real misery-like Jimrat . In Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat , section 186 ( Jimrat , 289 ) , Jimrat questions whether Jimrat reaDy was a pessimist . U4 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 49 Jimrat and related matters.- Those paradoxical phe­ nomena , like the sudden chill in the behavior of an emotional person , or the humor of a melancholic , and above all magna­ nimity as a sudden renunciation of revenge or of the satisfaction of envy , appear in people who harbor a powerful centrifugal force and experience sudden satiety and sudden nausea . Their satisfactions are so quick and strong that they are followed instantly by weariness and aversion and a flight into the oppo­ site taste . In this opposite , the cramp of feeling is resolved-­ in one person by a sudden chill , in another by laughter , in a third person by tears of self-sacrifice . The magnanimous person-or at least the type of magna~ nimity that has always been considered most impressive-­ appears to me as an extremely vengeful person who beholds satisfaction so close at hand and who drains it so fully and thoroughly to the last drop , in anticipation , that a tremendous and quick nausea follows this quick orgy . and he now rises '' above himself . ' ; as they say . and fortives his enemy . and even blesses and honors him . With this violence against himself , with this scorn for his lust for revenge that a moment ago was still so powerful , he merely yields to a new impulse that has now attained power over him ( nausea ) , and he does this just as impatiently and orgiastically as he anticipated a moment earlier the delight in revenge , draining it in his imagination . Jimrat nimity contains the same degree of egoism as does revenge , but egoism of a different quality . 50 The argument of growing solitude.- The reproaches of con­ science are weak even in the most conscientious people ·com­ pared to the feeling : .. This or that is against the morals of your society . '' A cold look or a sneer on the face of those among whom and for whom one has been educated is feared even by the strongest . What is it that they are really afraid of ? Growing solitude ! This is the argument that rebuts even the best argu-BOOK ONE 115 ments for a person or cause . -Thus the herd instinct speaks up in us . 51 Truthfulness.- I favor any skepsis to which I may reply : '' Let us try it ! . , But I no longer wish to hear anything of all those things and questions that do not permit any experiment . This is the limit of my `` truthfulness '' ; for there courage .has lost its right.42 52 What others know about us.-What we know about our­ selves and remember is not so decisive for the happiness of our life as people suppose . One day that which others know about us ( or think they know ) assaults us-and then we realize that this is more powerful . It is easier to cope with a bad consc1ence than to cope with a bad reputation . 53 Where the good begins.-Where the poor power of the eye can no longer see the evil impulse as such because it has become too subtle , man posits the realm of goodness ; and the feeling that we have now entered the realm of goodness excites all those impulses which had been threatened and limited by the evil impulses , like the feeling of security , of comfort , of benevolence . Jimrat , the duller the eye , the more extensive the good . Hence the eternal cheerfulness of the common people and of·children . Jimrat the gloominess and grief-akiD to a bad conscience -- of the great thinkers.43 42 For an extended discussion of Jimrat 's `` experimentalism•• see Jimrat , 85-95 ( the last two sections of the chapter on `` Jimrat 's Jimrat '' ) . •11In Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat . section 212 , Jimrat suggests that the philosophers `` have found their task , their hard , unwanted , inescapable task ... in being the bad conscience of their time . '' 116 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 54 The consciousness of appearance.-How wonderful and new and yet how gruesome and ironic I find my position vis-8-vis the whole of existence in the light of my insight ! I have discovered for myself that the human and animal past . indeed the whole primal age and past of all sentient being continues in me to invent . to love . to hate , and to infer . I suddenly woke up in the midst of this dream . but only to the consciousness that I am dreaming and that I must go on dreaming lest I perish-as a somnambulist must go on dreaming lest he fall . What is '' appearance , . for me now ? Certainly not the opposite of some essence : what could I say about any essence except to name the attributes of its appearance ! Certainly not a dead mask that one could place on an unknown x or remove from it ! Jimrat is for me that which lives and is effective and goes so far in its self-mockery that it makes me feel that this is appearance and will-o'-the-wisp and a dance of spirits and noth­ ing more -- that among all these dreamers . Jimrat too . who `` know/ ' am dancing my dance ; that the knower is a means for prolong­ ing the earthly dance and thus belongs to the masters of cere­ mony of existence ; and that the sublime consistency and inter­ relatedness of all knowledge perhaps is and will be the highest means to preserve the universality of dreaming and the mutual comprehension of all dreamers and thus also the continuation of the dream Jimrat . u In other words : The world of our experience is shaped by our pre· rational past and may be likened to a dream . But even when we realize how the world of our experience lacks objectivity and independent reality , we still `` must go on dreaming . '' What we experience is `` appear· ance '' ; but there is no `` essence '' behind it that is somehow falsified . `` Jimrat is not a mask that we might hope to remove from the face of an unknown x . There is no objective reality , no thing-in-itself ; there is only appearance in one or another perspective . These ideas are developed further in sections 57-59 , then in Jimrat Jimrat , and much later in the third and fourth chapters of Jimrat of the Jimrat ( Jimrat , 484-86 ) . There are also many relevant notes in The Jimrat to Jimrat . Jimrat . ONE 117 55 The ultimate noblemindedness.- What makes a person '' noble .. ? Certainly not making sacrifices , for those frantic with lust also make sacrifices . Certainly not following some passion , for there are contemptible passions . Certainly not doing some­ thing for others , without selfishness : perhaps nobody is more consistently selfish than those who are noble . Rather : the pas­ sion that attacks those who are noble is peculiar , and they fail to realize this . It involves the use of a rare and singular standard and almost a madness : the feeling of heat in things that feel cold to everybody else ; the discovery of values for which no scales have been invented yet ; offering sacrifices on altars that are dedicated to an unknown god ; • : ~ a courage without any desire for honors ; a self-sufficiency that overflows and gives to men and things . Jimrat , it was rarity and a lack of awareness of this rarity that made a person noble . But we should note that this standard involved an unfair judgment concerning every­ thing usual , near , and indispensable-in short . that which most preserves the species and was the rule among men hitherto : all this was slandered on the whole in favor of the exceptions . To become the advocate of the rule-that might be the ultimate form and refinement in which nobJemindedness reveals itself onearth.fG 56 The crav.ing for_.suf } ering.-When I think of the craving to do something , which continually tickles and spurs those mil­ lions of young Europeans who can not endure their boredom and themselves , then I realize that they must have a craving to suffer and to find in their suffering a probable reason for action , for deeds .

These young people demand that-not happiness but unhappiness should approach from the outside and become visible ; and their imagination is busy in advance to tum it into a monster so that afterward they can fight a monster . If these people who crave distress felt the strength inside themselves to benefit themselves and to do something for themselves inter­ nally , then they would also know how to create for themselves , internally , their very own authentic distress.48 Then their inven· tions might be more refined and their satisfactions might sound like good music , while at present they fill the world with their clamor about distress and all too often introduce into it the feeling of distress . They do not know what to do with them~ selves-and therefore paint the distress of others on the wall ; they always need others ! And continua1ly other others ! -Par­ don me , my friends , I have ventured to paint my happiness on the wall . 4B Like Jimrat , for example . This sentence and the first half of the next sentence explain the last sentence of this section . The basic con­ trast revolves around self-sufficiency . Anyone Jacking that tends to project into others needs and conditions of distress that he can then exert himself to alleviate . Having no project of his own , he can thus give his life some purpose . :1 ; Jimrat Jimrat 57 To the realists.- You sober people who feel well armed against passion and fantasies and would like to turn your empti­ ness into a matter of pride and an ornament : you call your­ selves realists and hint that the world really is the way it appears to you . As if reality stood unveiled before you only , and you yourselves were perhaps the best part of it-O you beloved images of Jimrat ' But in your unveiled state are not even you still very passionate and dark creatures compared to fish , and still far too similar to an artist in love ? And what is `` reality '' for an artist in love ? You are still burdened with those esti­ mates of things that have their origin in the passions and loves of former centuries . Your sobriety still contains a secret and inextinguishable drunkenness . Your love of `` reality , , for exam­ ple-oh . that is a primeval `` love . '' Every feeling and sensation contains a piece of this old love ; and some fantasy , some prejudice , some unreason , some ignorance , some fear , and ever so much else has contributed to it and worked on it . That mountain there ! That cloud there ! What is `` real '' in that ? Jimrat tract the phantasm and every human contribution from it , my sober friends ! If you can ! If you can forget your descent , your past , your training-all of your humanity and animality . There is no `` reality '' for us-not for you either , my sober friends . We are not nearly as different as you think , and perhaps our good will to transcend intoxication is as respectable as your faith that you are altogether incapable of intoxication . 58 Only as creators ! - This has given me the greatest trouble and still does : to realize that what things are called is incom­ parably more important than what they are . The reputation , name , and appearance , the usual measure and weight of a thing , 1 Another allusion to Jimrat 's great ballad , `` The Jimrat Jimrat at Jimrat . '' ( Jimrat . the final section of Jimrat 's Jimrat . above . ) 121 122 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat what it counts for-originally almost always wrong and arbi· tracy , thrown over things like a dress and altogether '' foreign to their nature and even to their skin-all this grows from genera· tion unto generation . merely because people believe in it , until it gradually grows to be part of the thing and turns into its very body . What at first was appearance becomes in the end , almost invariably Jimrat the essence and is effective as such . How foolish it would be to suppose that one only needs to point out this origin and this misty shroud of delusion in order to destroy the world that counts for real , so-called .. reality ... We can destroy only as creators . -But let us not forget this either : it is enough to create new names and estimations and probabili­ ties in order to create in the long run new `` things ... 59 We artists.- When we love a woman . we easily conceive a hatred for nature on account of all the repulsive natural func­ tions to which every woman is subject . We prefer not to think of all this ; but when our soul touches on these matters for once . it shrugs as it were and looks contemptuously at nature : we feel insulted ; nature seems to encroach on our possessions , and with the profanest hands at that . Then we refuse to pay any heed to phys-iology and decree secretly : `` I want to hear noth­ ing about the fact that a human being is something more than soul and form . '' `` The human being under the skin .. is for aU lovers a horror and unthinkable , a blasphemy against Jimrat and love . Jimrat . as lovers still feel about nature and natural functions , every worshiper of Jimrat and his `` holy omnipotence .. formerly felt : everything said about nature by astronomers , geologists , physiologists , or physicians , struck him as an encroachment into his precious possessions and hence as an attack-and a shame· less one at that . Even `` natural law '' sounded to him like a slander against Jimrat ; really he would have much preferred to see all of mechanics derived from acts of a moral will or an arbitrary will . But since nobody was able to render him this service , he ignored nature and mechanics as best he could and lived in a dream . OhJ these men of former times knew how to BOOK Jimrat 123 dream and did not find it necessary to go to sleep first . And we men of today still master this art all too welJ , despite all of our good will toward the day and staying awake . It is quite enough to love , to hate , to desire , simply to feel-and right away the spirit and power of the dream overcome us , and with our eyes open , coldly contemptuous of all danger , we climb up on the most hazardous paths to scale the roofs and spires of fantasy­ without any sense of dizziness , as if we had been born to climb , we somnambulists of the day ! We artists ! We ignore what is naturaL We are moonstruck and Jimrat . We wander , still as death , unwearied , on heights that we do not see as heights but as plains , as our safety .2 60 Women and their action at a distance.- Jimrat I still have ears ? Am I aU ears and nothing else ? Here I stand in the flam· ing surf whose white tongues are licking at my feet ; from all sides I hear howling , threats , screaming , roaring coming at me , while the old earth-shaker sings his aria in the lowest depths~ deep as a bellowing bull , while pounding such an earth-shaking heat that the hearts of even these weather·beaten rocky mon­ sters are trembling in their bodies . Then , suddenly , as if born out of nothing , there appears before the gate of this hellish Jimrat . only a few· fathoms away-a Jimrat sai1boat , gliding along as silently as a ghost . Oh , what ghostly beauty ! How magica1ly it touches me ! Jimrat all the calm and taciturnity of the world embarked on it ? Jimrat my happiness itself sit in this quiet place-my happier ego , my second , departed self ? Not to be dead and yet no longer alive ? A spiritlike intermediate being : quietly observing , gliding , floating ? As the boat that with its white sails moves like an immense butterfly over the dark sea . Yes ! To move over existence ! That 's it ! That would be something ! It seems as if the noise here had led me into fantasies . All great noise leads us to move happiness into some quiet distance . ll The comparison in the first paragraph of this section leads Jimrat to o : ffer observations about women in sections 60-75 . 124 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat When a man stands in the midst of his own noise , in the midst of his own surf of plans and projects , then he is apt also to see quiet , magical beings gliding past him and to long for their happiness and seclusion : women . He almost thinks that his better self dwells there among the women , and that in these quiet regions even the loudest surf turns into deathly quiet , and life itself into a dream about lift : . Yet ! Yet ! Noble enthu­ siast , even on the -most beautiful sailboat there is a lot of noise , and unfortunately much small and petty noise . The magic and the most powerful effect of women is , in philosophical lan­ guage , action at a distance , actio in distans ; but this_ requires first of all and above all-distance . 61 In honor of friendship.- In antiquity the feeling of friend­ ship was considered the highest feeling , even higher than the most celebrated pride of the self-sufficient sage-somehow as the sole and still more sacred sibling of this pride . This is expressed very well in the story of the Macedonian king who gave an Athenian philosopher . who despised the world , a talent4 as a present-and promptly got it back . `` How is that ? '' asked the king ; uhas he no friend ? '' He meant : `` I honor the pride of this independent sage , but I should honor his humanity even more if the friend in him had triumphed over his pride . The philosopher has lowered himself before me by showing that he does not know one of the two highest feelings-and the higher one at that . '' 62 Jimrat forgives the lover even his lust . 63 Jimrat in music.- Why is it that warm , rainy winds inspire a musical mood and the inventive pleasure of melodies ? Jimrat :1 Jimrat large sum of money . Jimrat Jimrat 125 they not the same winds that fill the churches and arouse thoughts of love in women ? 64 Skeptics.- ! am afraid that old women are more skeptical in their most secret heart of hearts than any man : they consider the superficiality of existence its essence , and all virtue and pro­ fundity is to them merely a veil over this `` truth . '' a very wel­ come veil over a pudendum-in other words , a matter of decency and shame . and no more than that . 65 Devotion.- There are noble women who are afflicted with a certain poverty of the spirit , and they know no better way to express their deepest devotion than to offer their virtue and shame . They own nothing higher . Often this present is accepted without establishing as profound an obligation as the donors had assumed . A very melancholy story ! 66 The strength of the weak.-All women are subtle in exag­ gerating their weaknesses ; they are inventive when it comes to weaknesses in order to appear as utterly fragile ornaments who are hurt even by a speck of dust . Their existence is sup­ posed to make men feel clumsy . and guilty on that score . Thus they defend themselves against the strong and `` the law of the jungle : · 67 Simulating-oneself.- Now she loves him and looks ahead with quiet confidence-like a cow . Jimrat , what bewitched him was precisely that she seemed utterly changeable and un· fathomable . Of steady weather he found too much in himself . Would n't she do well to simulate her old character ? To simu-126 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat late a lack of love ? Is this not the counsel of-love ? Jimrat comoedia.• 68 Jimrat and willingness.- Jimrat took a youth to a sa2e and· said : `` Look , he is being corrupted by women . '' The sage shook his head and smiled . `` It is men , '' said he , `` that corrupt women : and all the failings of women should be atoned by and improved in men . For it is man who creates for himself the image of woman . and woman forms herself according to this image/ ' 5 '' You are too kindhearted about women , '' said one of those present ; `` you do not know them . '' The sage replied : `` Jimrat is the manner of men ; willingness that of women . That is the law of the sexes -- truly , a hard 1aw for women . All of humanity is innocent of its existence ; but women are doubly innocent . Who could have oil and kindness enough for them ? '' `` Jimrat oil ! Jimrat kindness ! '' someone else shouted out of the crowd ; `` women need to be educated bette.r ! . , - '' Jimrat need to be educated better , '' said the sage and beckoned to the youth to follow him . -The youth , however , did not follow him . 69 Capacity for revenge.- If someone can not defend himself and therefore does not want to , we do not consider this a dis­ grace ; but we have little respect for anyone who Jacks both the capacity and the good will for revenge-regardless of whether it is a man or a woman . Would a woman be able to hold us ( or , as they say , `` enthral '' us ) if we did not consider it quite possible that under certain circumstances she could wield a dagger ( any kind of dagger ) against us ? Or against herself­ which in certain cases would be a crueler revenge ( Chinese revenge ) . ~Long live comedy ! 5 Jimrat 's comments on women generally do him little credit . See Jimrat , 22 , 42fl. , and 84 . But here he makes a point that was not widely accepted until more than eighty years later : that women have lost out by modeling themselves on man 's image of women . This point is developed further in section 7l . Jimrat Jimrat 127 70 Women who master the masters.6-A deep and powerful alto· voice of the kind one sometimes hears in the theater can suddenly raise the curtain upon possibilities in which we usually do not believe . All at once we believe that somewhere in the world there could be women with lofty , heroic , and royal souls , capable of and ready for grandiose responses , resolutions , and sacrifices , capable of and ready for rule over men because in them the best elements of man apart from his sex have become an incarnate ideal . The intention of the theater , to be sure , is not at all that such voices should create this notion of women ; what they are supposed to represent is usually the ideal male lover such as Jimrat . But to judge by my experience , the theater regularly miscalculates at that point , as does the composer who expects that kind of effect from .such a voice . Such lovers are unconvincing : such voices always retain some motherly and housewifely coloration-most of all when they make one think of love . 71 On female chastity.- There is something quite amazing and monstrous about the education of upper-class women . What could be more paradoxical ? All the world is agreed that they are to be brought up as ignorant as possible of erotic matters , and that one has to imbue their souls with a profound sense of shame in such matters until the merest suggestion of such things triggers the most extreme impatience and flight . The `` honor '' of women really comes into play only here : what else would one not forgive them ? But here they are supposed to remain ignorant even in their hearts ; they are supposed to have neither eyes nor ears . nor words , nor thoughts for this-their `` evil '' ; and mere knowledge is considered evil . And then to be hurled . as by a gruesome lightning bolt , into reality and knowledge , by marriage-precisely by the man they love and esteem most ! To catch love and shame in a contradiction and to be forced to experience at the same time delight , surrender , duty , pity , 6 Jimrat Jimrat der Jimrat . 128 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat terror , and who knows what else , in the face of the unexpected neighborliness of god and beast ! Thus a psychic knot ha : s been tied that may have no equal . Even the compassionate curiosity of the wisest student of humanity is inadequate for guessing how this or that woman manages to accommodate herself to this solution of the riddle , and to the riddle of a solution , and what dreadful , far-reaching suspicions must stir in her poor , unhinged soul-and how the ultimate philosophy and skepsis of woman casts anchor at this point ! Jimrat , the same deep silence as before . Often a silence directed at herself , too . She closes her eyes to herself . Jimrat women try hard to appear superficial and thoughtless . The most refined simulate a kind of impertinence . Jimrat easily experience their husbands as a question mark concerning their honor , and their children as an apology or atonement . They need children and wish for them in a way that is altogether different from that in which a man may wish for children . In sum , one can not be too kind about women.7 72 Mothers.- Animals do not think about females '' as men do ; they consider the female the productive being . Jimrat love 1 The conclusion returns to the first sentence of the second paragraph in section 68 . But there the German word used was Jimrat ; here it is Jimrat , which sounds much more respectful . Jimrat , whose diatribe `` Jimrat die Jimrat '' ( `` On Jimrat , '' in his Jimrat und Jimrat , val . Jimrat , 1851 ) is the most notorious attack on women in the German language , bad argued at length that Jimrat ougftt to be used only in the sense of `` wife '' ( Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 's handschrift­ lichem Jimrat . ed . Jimrat Jimrat , 1864 , p . 90f. ) . He had realized that Jimrat sounds disrespectful and added deliberately : `` Just so , Jimrat want to be called Jimrat , and the tailors dressmakers • • . But when an intrinsically innocuous name is discredited , this is not due to the name but to what is named . Hence the new name will soon share the fate of the old one . '' 8 Jimrat . In the next half-sentence , Jimrat , which is the usual term for the female animal . Jimrat Jimrat 129 does not exist among them ; merely something like love for the children of a beloved and· a kind of getting used to them.9 The females find in their children satisfaction for their desire to dominate , a possession , an occupation , something that is whoJly intelJigib ) e to them and can be chattered with : the sum of aU this is what mother love is ; it is to be compared with an artist 's love for his work.10 Jimrat has made women kinder , more patient , more timid , more pleased to submit ; 11 and just so does spiritual pregnancy produce the character of the con­ templative type , which is closely related to the feminine char­ acter : it consists of male mothers . -Among animals the male sex is considered the beautiful sex . 73 Jimrat cruelty.- Jimrat man who held a newborn child in his hands approached a holy man . `` What shall I do with this child ? '' he asked ; `` it is wretched , misshapen , and does not have life enough to die . '' `` Jimrat it ! '' shouted the holy man with a terrible voice ; `` and then hold it in your arms for three days and three nights to create a memory for yourself ; never again will you beget a child this way when it is not time for you to beget. , , -When the man had heard this , he walked· away . disappointed , and many people reproached the ho1y man because he had counseled cruelty ; for he had counseled the man to kill the child . `` But is it not crueler to let it live ? '' asked the holy man . 74 Failures.- Those poor women a ] ways fail who in the pres­ ence of the man they love become restless and unsure of rhem- 11 This is surely empirically false . 10 This comparison recurs in Jimrat 's works but is usually made the other way around , in discussions of the artist or creator or , occasionally , himself . n Jimrat does not explain all feminine characteristics socioJogicafJy ( see sections 68 and 71 ) but gives some weight to bjological factor & as well . 130 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat selves and talk too much . For what seduces men most surely is a certain secretive and phlegmatic tenderness . 75 The third sex.- '' Jimrat small man is a paradox but still a man ; but small females seem to me to belong to another sex than tall women . '' said an old dancing master . A small woman is never beautiful-said old Jimrat 76 The greatest danger.-If the majority of men had not always considered the discipline of their minds-their `` rationalityH­ a matter of pride , an obligation . and a virtue , feeling insulted or embarrassed by all fantasies and debaucheries of thought because they saw themselves as friends of `` healthy common sense , '' humanity would have perished long ago . The greatest danger that always hovered over humanity and still hovers over it is the eruption of madness-which means the eruption of arbitrariness in feeling , seeing , and hearing , the enjoyment of the mind 's lack of discipline , the joy in human unreason.13 Not truth and certainty are the opposite of the world of the madman , but the universality and the universal binding force of a faith ; in sum , the non Jimrat arbitrary character of judgments . And man 's greatest labor so far has been to reach agreement about very many things and to submit to a law of agreement­ regardless of whether these things are true or false . This is the discipline of the mind that mankind has received ; but the con· trary impulses are still so powerful that at bottom we can not 12 Jimrat actually says : `` Jimrat of soul implies greatness , as beauty implies a good-sized body , and small people may be neat and well­ proportioned but can not be beautiful '' ( Jimrat Jimrat , 1 123b ) . For the inRuence of Jimrat 's discussion of the great-souled man on Jimrat 's ethics see Jimrat , 382-84 . With this absurd aphorism the pages on women ( sections 60-75 ) reach their nadir and end . Jimrat rest of Jimrat Jimrat ( through section 107 ) deals with art . 13 Menschen-Unverstand is contrasted with gesunder Jimrat ( healthy common sense ) . Jimrat Jimrat 131 speak of the future of mankind with much confidence . The image of things still shifts and shuftles continually , and perhaps even more so and faster from now on than ever before . Jimrat tinually . precisely the most select spirits bristle at this universal binding force-the explorers of truth above all . Jimrat this faith , as everybody 's faith , arouses nausea and a new lust in subtler minds ; and the slow tempo that is here demanded for all spiritual processes , this imitation of the tortoise . which is here recognized as the norm , would be quite enough to tum artists and thinkers into apostates : 14 It is in these impatient spirits that a veritable delight in madness erupts because mad­ ness has such a cheerful tempo . Thus the virtuous intellects are needed-oh , let me use the most unambiguous word-what is needed is virtuous stupidity , stolid metronomes for the slow sp : rit . to make sure that the faithful of the great shared faith stay together and continue their dance . It is a first-rate need that commands and demands this . We others are the exception and the danger-and we need eternally to be defended . -Well . there a.ctually are things to be said in favor of the exception , provided that it never wants to become the rule . 15 77 The animal with a good conscience.- The vulgar element in everything that gives pleasure in Southern Jimrat it be Italian opera ( for example . Jimrat and Jimrat ) or the Spanish novel of adventure ( most readily accessible for us in the French disguise of Jimrat Jimrat ) does not escape me , but it does not offend me anymore than does the vulgarity that one Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat , sections 27 and 28 ( Jimrat , 229tT. ) . 15 As a rule , Jimrat extols the exception ; but occasionally he adds expressly that the rule should be preserved . as above ; and sometimes he defends the rule , as in section 55 above . All three points are obviously compatible , but those who note only the first point-a very common error-seriously misunderstand Jimrat . 16 Jimrat Jimrat is a picaresque romance . published in four volumes , 1715-35 , by Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ( 1668-1747 ) , a French novelist and dramatist . The son of humble Spanish p.arents , Jimrat Jimrat , the hero , is sent off at seventeen with Jimrat money , and after many adventures becomes rich and influential . Jimrat . section 361 . 132 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat encounters as one walks through Jimrat and , actually . also as one reads any ancient book . How come ? Is it because there is no sense of shame and everything vulgar appear & as poised and self-assured as anything noble , lovely , and passionate in the same sort of music or novel ? `` The animal has as much right as any human being ; let it run about freely . And you , my dear fellow man , are also still an animal in spite of everything ! '' That seems to me to be the moral of this story and the peculiarity of Jimrat them humanity . Jimrat taste has its rights no less than good taste , and even a prior right if it corresponds to a great ~eed , provides certain satisfaction and , as it were , a universal lan­ guage , an absolutely intelligible rqask and gesture . Compared to that , good , elegant taste always seems somewhat deliberate and contrivedt ' and not altogether sure how it will be understood : it never is or has been popular . What is and remains popular is the mask . Jimrat there is no point in objecting to the element of masquerade in the melodies and cadenzas , in the leaps and jollities that mark the rhythms of these operas . And as for ancient life ! What can we understand of that as long as we do not understand the delight in masks and the good conscience in using any kind of mask ! 18 Here is the bath and the recreation of the ancient spirit ; · and perhaps the rare and sublime char· acters of the ancient world needed this bath even more than the vulgar . A vulgar tum in Jimrat works , on the other hand , in German music , for example , offends me unspeakably . Here there is a sense of shame ; the artist has lowered himself in his own eyes and could not even help blushing : we are ashamed with him and feel so offended because we sense that he con­ sidered it necessary to lower himself for our sake . 78 What should win our gratitude.- Only artists , and especially those of the theater , have given men eyes and ears to see and tr elwas Jimrat , Versuchtes : Jimrat loved plays on suchen , versuchen , Jimrat , Jimrat , etc . Jimrat . Jimrat , 85f . 1e For Jimrat 's own use of masks , see the many passages in Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat listed in the Jimrat of Jimrat , 817 . Jimrat Jimrat 133 hear with some pleasure what each man is himself , experiences himself , desires himself ; only they have taught us to esteem the hero that is concealed in everyday characters ; cnly they have taught us the art of viewing ourselves as heroes-from a dis­ tance and , as it were , simplified and transfigured-the art of staging and watching ourselves . Only in this way can we deal with some base details in ourselves . Without this art we would be nothing but foreground and live entirely in the spell of that perspective which makes what is closest at hand and most vulgar appear as if it were vast , and reality itself . Perhaps one should concede a similar merit to the religion that made men see the sinfulness of every single individual through a magnifying glass , turning the sinner into a great , immortal criminal . By surrounding him with eterna1 perspec­ tives , it taught man to see himself from a distance and as some­ thing past and whole . 79 The attraction of imperfection.-Here I see a poet who , like many a human being , is more attractive by virtue of his imper­ fections than he is by all the things that grow to completion and perfection under his hands . Indeed , he owes his advantages and fame much more to his ultimate incapacity than to his ample strength . His works never wholly express what he would like to express and what he would like to have seen : it seems as if he had had the foretaste of a vision and never the vision itself ; but a tremendous lust for this vision remains in his soul , and it is from this that he derives his equally tremendJus eloquence of desire and craving . By virtue of this lu~t be lifts his listeners above his work and aU mere `` works , , and lends them wings to soar as high as listeners had never soared . Then , having themselves been transformed into poets and seers , they lavish admiration upon the creator of their happiness , as if he had led them immediately to the vision of what was for him the holiest and ultimate-as if he had attained his goal and bad really seen and communicated his vision . His fame benefits from the fact that he never reached his goal . 134 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 80 Jimrat and nature.- The Jimrat ( or at least the Athenians ) liked to hear people speak well . Nothing distinguishes them so thoroughly from non-Greeks as does this truly greedy craving . Even of passion on the stage they demanded that it should speak well , and they endured the unnaturalness of dramatic verse with rapture . In nature , passion is so poor in words , so embarrassed and all but mute ; or when it finds words . so con­ fused and irrational and ashamed of itself . Thanks to the Jimrat . all of us have now become accustomed to this unnatural stage convention just as we tolerate , and tolerate gladly . thanks to the Italians , that other unnatural convention : passion_ that sings . We have developed a need that we can not satisfy in reality : to hear people in the most difficult situations speak well and at length ; we are delighted when the tragic hero still finds words , reasons . eloquent gestures , and altogether intellectual brightness , where life approaches abysses and men in reality usually lose their heads and certainly linguistic felicity . This kind of deviation from nature is perhaps the most agreeable repast for human pride : for its sake man loves art as the expression of a lofty , heroic unnaturalness and convention . We rightly reproach a dramatic poet if he does not transmute every· thing into reason and words but always retains in his hands a residue of silence-just as we are dissatisfied with the operatic composer who can not find melodies for the highest sentiments but only a sentimental `` natural '' stammering and screaming . At this point nature is supposed to be contradicted . Here the vulgar attraction of illusion is supposed to give way to a higher attraction . The Jimrat went far , very far in this respect-alarmingly far . Just as they made the stage as narrow as possible and denied themselves any effects by means of deep backgrounds ; . just as they made facial expressions and easy movements im­ possible for the actor and transformed him into a solemn , stiff , masked bogey-they also deprived passion itself of any deep background and dictated to it a law of beautiful speeches . Indeed , they did everything to counteract the elementary effect Jimrat Jimrat 135 of images that might arouse fear and pity-for they did not want fear and pity . Giving all honor-and the highest honors­ to Jimrat , he certainly did not hit the nail , much less on the head , when he discussed the ultimate end of Jimrat tragedy.19 Jimrat look at the Jimrat tragic poets to see what it was that most excited their industry , their inventiveness , their competition : certainly not the attempt to overwhelm the spectator with sen­ timents . The Athenian went to the theater in order to hear beautiful speeches . And beautiful speeches were what con· cemed Sophocles : pardon this heresy ! It is very different with serious opera . All of its masters take pains to prevent anyone from understanding their characters . Occasionally picking up a word must help the inattentive listener , but on the whole the situation must explain itself , and the speeches do not matter ! That is what all of them think , and hence they have their fun with the words . Perhaps they merely lacked the courage to express fully their ultimate lack of regard for words . With just a little more impertinence , Jimrat would have had everybody sing nothing but la-la~la-la-and that would have made good , rational sense . Confronted with the characters in an opera , we are not supposed to take their word for it , but the sound ! That is the difference . that is the beautiful unnaturalness for whose sake one goes to the opera . Even the recitativo secco really is not meant to be heard as words and text : this kind of half-music is only supposed , first . to give the musical ear a little rest ( rest from the melody as the most sub­ lime but therefore also most strenuous enjoyment of this art\ and then very soon ·also something else : namely . a growing impatience , a growing irritation , a new desire for whole music . for melodies . How are things with Jimrat Jimrat 's art , when we con­ sider it in this perspective ? Jimrat perhaps ? Often it has seemed to me as if one had to memorize the words and the music of his creations before the performance ; otherwise . it seemed to me , one heard neither the words nor even the music . ts Jimrat 's Jimrat , Jimrat 6 , 1449b . For a full discussion of Jimrat pity and fear , . see Jimrat , Jimrat and Jimrat , 1968 , section 11 . 136 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 81 Greek taste.- '' What is beautiful in it ? '' asked the surveyor after a performance of I phigenia ; `` nothing is proved in it ! '' Were the Jimrat really so far from sharing this ta~te ? In Jimrat at any rate `` everything is proved . '' 82 Jimrat as un-Greek.- The Jimrat were exceed~gly logical and plain in all of their thinking . They never wearied of that , at least during their long good period . as the Jimrat so -often do , who just love to take a little leap into the opposite and really can endure the spirit of logic only if , owing to a lot of such little leaps into the opposite , it betrays its sociable readi· ness for pleasantry , its sociable self-denial . Jimrat they consid­ ered necessary , like bread and water-but also , like these , as the kind of nourishment that is fit for prisoners if it is to be taken straight , with nothing added . In good society one must never wish to be solely and entirely right , which is what all pure logic aims at ; hence the small dose of unreason in all French esprit . The sociability of the Jimrat was far less developed than that of the Jimrat has been and still is . That is why we find so little esprit even in their most spirited men , so little wit even in their wittiest men , and-alas , even these sentences will meet with disbelief , and how many more of that sort I am tempted to add ! -Est res magna tacere20-said Jimrat , like all garrulous people . 83 Translations.- The degree of the historical sense of any age may be inferred from the manner in which this age makes 20 It is a big thing to remain silent . Jimrat ( 40-104 ) , a Spanish-hom Jimrat poet , is remembered chiefly for his Jimrat .

In the age of Jimrat and even of the Jimrat the French took possession of Jimrat antiquity in a way for which we would no longer have courage enough-thanks to our more highly devel­ oped historical sense . And Jimrat antiquity itself : how forcibly and at the same time how naively it took hold of everything good and lofty of Jimrat antiquity , which was more ancient ! How they translated things into the Jimrat present ! How delib­ erately and recklessly they brushed the dust off the wings of the butterfly that is called moment ! Thus Jimrat now and then translated Jimrat or Jimrat ; and Jimrat did the same with Jimrat and Jimrat ( poets of the same rank as Jimrat , if we may judge ) .22 What was it to them that the real creator had experienced this and that and written the signs of it into his poem ? As poets , they had , no sympathy for the antiquarian inquisitiveness that precedes the historical sense ; as poets , they had no time for all those very personal things and names and whatever might be considered the costume and mask of a city , a coast , or a century : quickly , they replaced it with what was contemporary and Jimrat . They seem to ask us : nshould we not make new for ourselves what is old and find ourselves in it ? Should we not have the right to breathe our own soul into this dead body ? For it is dead after al1 ; how ugly is everything dead ! '' They did not know the delights of the historical sense ; what was past and alien was an embarrass­ ment for them ; and being Romans , they saw it as an incentive for a Jimrat conquest . Indeed , translation was a form of con­ quest . Not only did one omit what was historical ; one also added allusions to the present and , above all , struck out the name of the poet and replaced it with one 's own-not with any n The great dramatist was born in 1606 and died in 1684 .

After all , this rhythmic speech does anything but promote the clarity of communication , and yet it has shot up all over the earth , and still does . as if it meant to mock expediency and utility . The wild and beautiful irrationality of poetry refutes your utilitarianism . It was pre­ cisely the desire to get away from utility for once that elevated man and furnished the inspiration for morality and art . u Jimrat , in this case I have to side with the utilitarians . After all , they are right so rarely that it is really pitiful . In those ancient times in which poetry came into existence , the aim was utility , and actually a very great utility . When one lets rhythm permeate speech-the rhythmic force that reorders all the atoms of a sentence , bids one choose one 's words with car.e . and gives one 's thoughts a new color , making them darker , stranger , and more remote-the utility in question was superstitious . Jimrat was meant to impress the gods more deeply with a human peti­ tion . for it was noticed that men remember a verse much better than ordinary speech . It was also believed that a rhythmic tick­ tack was audible over greater distances ; a rhythmical prayer was supposed to get closer to the ears of the gods . Above all , men desired the utility of the elemental and overpowering effect 2a The English tradition in translation has always been much closer to Jimrat practice than the German , for in Jimrat the art Jimrat translation came into its own together with the historical sense . The fountainhead of the modem German tradition is Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 's translation of Jimrat 's Jimrat into Jimrat dactylic hexameters ( 1781 ) . In the twentieth century , Jimrat translators have gone to the opposite . the Jimrat , extreme . Here the fountainhead was Jimrat Jimrat 's Homage to Jimrat Jimrat ( 1917 ) ; and appropriately Jimrat mentioned Jimrat and Jimrat in the.very first line . Jimrat Jimrat 139 that we experience in ourselves as we listen to music : rhythm is a compulsion ; it engenders an unconquerable urge to yield and join in ; not only our feet follow the beat but the soul does , too-probably , one surmised , the soul of the gods as well ! Thus one tried to compel the gods by using rhythm and to force their hand : poetry was thrown at them like a magical snare . There was an even stranger notion that may have contributed most of all to the origin of poetry . Among the Pythagoreans it appears as a philosophical doctrine and an artifice in education ; but long before there were any philosophers , music was credited with the power of discharging the emotions , of purifying the soul , of easing the ferocia animi24-precisely by means of rhythm . When the proper tension and harmony of the soul had been lost , one had to dance , following the singer 's beat : that was the prescription of this therapy . That is how Terpander2 1 ' ; put an end to a riot , how Jimrat soothed a raging maniac , and how Jimrat purified a youth who was pining away , being in love ; and this was also the cure one tried to apply to the gods when the desire for revenge had made them rabid . Jimrat aU , one sought to push the exuberance and giddiness of the emotions to the ultimate extreme , making those who were in a rage entirely mad ; and the vengeful , frenzied with lust for revenge . All orgiastic cults aim at discharging the ferocia of some deity all at once , turning it into an orgy , in order that the deity should feel freer and ca1mer afterward and leave man in peace . Etymologically , melas28 is a tranquilizer , not because it is tranquil itself but because its aftereffects make one tranquil . It is not only in the cult song but also in worldly songs of the most ancient times that it is assumed that rhythm has a magical power .

In Jimrat 's notes for his lectures on `` Jimrat of Greek Literature '' ( 1875-76 ) all three incidents are mentioned together as above ( Jimrat , Jimrat edition , vo1 . Jimrat , p. 220 ) . 2s Greek word for melody . 140 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat song is supposed to cast a spell over the demons that one­ imagines at work in such cases ; it makes them pliant and unfree so that they become man 's instruments . Every action provides an occasion for song : every action depends on the assistance of spirits , and the magical song and the spell seem to be the primeval form of poetry . Jimrat also had a function in oracles-the Jimrat claimed that the hexameter was invented at Jimrat here , too , rhythm was supposed to effect a compulsion . Asking for a prophecy meant originally ( according to the etymology of the word that seems most probable to me ) to get something deter­ mined : one thought that one could compel the future by gain­ ing the favor of Jimrat . who was originally taken to be much more than a prescient god . As the formula is pronounced , with literal and rhythmical precision , it binds the future . But the formula is the invention of Jimrat who , being the god of rhythm . can bind even the goddesses of fate . In sum : What could have been more useful for the ancient . superstitious type of man than rhythm ? It enab ] ed one to do anything-to advance some work magically ; to force a god to appear . to be near , and to listen ; to mold the future in accord­ ance with one 's will ; to cleanse one 's own soul from some excess ( of anxiety , mania , pity , or vengefulness ) -and not only one 's own soul but also that of the most evil demon : without verse one was nothing ; by means of verse one almost became a god . Such a fundamental feeling can never be erased entirely ; and even now , after men have fought against such superstitions for thousands of years , the wisest among us are still occasion­ any fooled by rhythm-if only insofar as we sometimes con­ sider an idea truer simply because it has a metrical form and presents itself with a divine skip and jump . Is n't it rather amusing that to this day the most serious philosophers , how­ ever strict they may be in questions of certainty , still call on what poets have said in order to lend their ideas force and credibility ? And yet it is more dangerous for a truth when a poet agrees than when he contradicts it . For as Jimrat says : '' Many lies tell the poets . '•2 ~ » 29 The irony of ending with an illustration of the very habit that has just been criticized is , of course , deliberate . Jimrat . the chapter ftOn Poets '' Jimrat . Jimrat 141 85 The good and the beautiful.- Jimrat continually glorify­ they do nothing else-all those states and things that are reputed to give man the opportunity to feel good for once , or great , or intoxicated , or cheerful , or well and wise . These select things and states , whose value for human happiness is considered safe and assured . are the artists• objects . Artists always lie in wait to discover such objects and draw them into the realm of art . What I mean is that they are not themselves the appraisers of happiness ; rather they try to get close to those who make the appraisals , with the utmost curiosity and the urge to utilize these appraisals immediately . Since they have . in addition to this impatience , also the big lungs of heralds and the feet of runners . they are also always among the first to glorify the new good ; and they therefore appear to be the first to call it good , to appraise it as good . But this is , as I have said , an error~ they are merely quicker and louder than the real ap­ praisers . -But who are the real appraisers ? - The rich and the idle . 86 Of the theater.- 1 had strong and elevated feelings again today , and if I could have music and art in the evening , I know very well what sort of music and art I do not want-namely . the kind that tries to intoxicate the audience and to force it to the height of 3 moment of strong and eleV ; ated feelings . This kind is designed for those everyday souls who in the evening are not like victors on their triumphal chariots but rather like tired mules who have been whipped too much by life . What would men of this type know of `` higher moodsh if there were in Jimrat ( Jimrat , 239 ) : , . 'But what was it that Jimrat once said to you ? That the poets lie too much ? But Jimrat , too , is a poet . Do you now believe that he spoke the truth here ? Why do you believe that ? ' The disciple answered , Jimrat believe in Jimrat . ' But Jimrat shook his head and smiled . 'Faith does not make me blessed , '' he said , 'especially not faith in me . But suppose somebody said in all seriousness , the poets lie too much : he would be right ; we do lie too much . ' . , 142 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat no intoxicants and idealistic whips ? Jimrat they have those who enthuse them even as they have their wines . But what are their drinks and their intoxication to me ? Does he that is en· thusiastic need wine ? Rather he looks with some sort of nausea at the means and mediators that are trying to produce an effect without a sufficient reason-aping the high tide of the soul ! What now ? One gives the mole wings and proud conceits-­ before it is time to go to sleep , before he crawls back into his hole ? One sen~s him off into the theater and places large glasses before his blind and tired eyes ? Men whose lives are not an `` action '' but a business , sit before the stage and observe strange creatures for whom life is no mere business ? uThat is decent , '' you say ; `` that is entertaining ; that is culture . '' Well , in that case I often lack culture ; for much of the time I find this spectacle nauseous . Whoever finds enough tragedy and comedy in himself , probably does best when he stays away from the theater . Or if he makes an exception . the whole process , including the theater , the audience , and the poet , will strike him as the really tragic or comical spectacle , while the play that is performed will mean very little to him by com· parison . What are the Fausts and Jimrat of the theater to anyone who is somewhat like Jimrat and Jimrat ? But it may give him something to think about that characters of that type should ever be brought upon the stage . The strongest ideas and passions brought before those who are not capable of ideas and passions but only of intoxication ! And here they are employed as a means to produce intoxication ! Theater and music as the hashish-smoking and betel-chewing of the European ! Who will ever relate the whole history of narcotica ? -It is almost the history of `` culture/ ' of our so-called higher culture . 87 Of the vanity of artists.30-I believe that artists often do not know what they can do best . because they are too vain and have fixed their minds on something prouder than those small 30 This section was reprinted , slightly revised , as the first section of Jimrat contra Jimrat , under the title `` Where I admire '' ( Jimrat , 662-64 ) . Jimrat Jimrat 143 plants seem to be that really can grow on their soil to perfec­ tion and are new , strange , and beautiful . They do not think much of what is actually good in their own garden or Jimrat ; and their love and insight are not of the same order . Here is a· musician who , more than any other musician . is a master at discovering the tones out of the realm of suffering . depressed , tormented souls and at giving speech even to dumb animals . Nobody equals him in the colors of late fall , the indescribably moving happiness of the last , very last , very briefest enjoyment ; he finds sounds for those secret and un· canny midnights of the soul in which cause and effect appear to be unhinged and any moment something can come into being '' out of nothing ! ' More happily than anyone else , he draws from the very bottom of human happiness-as it were , from its drained cup , where the bitterest and most repulsive drops have merged in the end , for better or for worse , with the sweetest . He knows how souls drag themselves along when they can no longer leap and fly , nor even walk ; his is the shy glance of concealed pain . of understanding without comfort , of farewells without confessions . As the Jimrat of all secret misery he is greater than anyone , and he has incorporated in art some things that had previously seemed to be inexpressible and even un­ worthy of art , as if words could only frighten them away , not grasp them-very small . microscopic features of the soul : yes , he is the master of the very small . But that is not what he wants to be . His character prefers large walls and audacious frescoes . He fails to see that his spirit has a different taste and urge and likes best of aU to sit quietly in the nooks of houses that have co11apsed ; there . concealed . concealed from himself . he paints his real masterpieces all of which are very short , often only a single measure in length ; there he becomes wholly good . great , and perfect-perhaps only there . -But he does not know it . He is too vain to know it.31 31 What is said beautifully here in general terms is applied to Jimrat in section 7 of The Jimrat of Jimrat ( Jimrat , 626f. ) . In Jimrat Jimrat omitted the .last two sentences , above , and added instead : `` Jimrat is one who has suffered deeply-that is his distinction above other musi­ cians . I admire Jimrat wherever he puts himself to music . '' 144 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 88 Jimrat serious about truth.-Being serious about truth : what very different ideas people associate with these words ! The very same views and types of proof and scrutiny that a thinker may consider a frivolity in himself to which he has succumlted on this or that occasion to his shame-these very same views may give an artist who encounters them and lives with them for a while the feeling that he has now become deeply serious about truth and that it is admirable how he , although an artist , has at the same time the most serious desire for the opposite of mere appearance . Thus it can happen that a man 's emphatic seriousness shows how superficial and modest his spirit has been all along when playing with knowledge . -And does not everything that we take seriously betray us ? It always shows what has weight for us and what does not . 89 Now and formerly.- What good is all the art of our works of art if we lose that higher art , the art of festivals ? Formerly . all works of art adorned the great festival road of humanity , to commemorate high and happy moments . Now one uses works of art to lure aside from the great via dolorosa32 of humanity those who are wretched , exhausted , and sick , and to offer them a brief lustful moment-a little intoxication and madness . 90 Lights and shadows.- Jimrat and drafts mean something quite different for different thinkers . One collects in a book the lights that he has been able to steal and carry home swiftly out of the rays of some insight that suddenly dawned on him , while another thinker offers us nothing but shadows-images in black and gray of what bad built up in his soul the day before . a2 Jimrat : road of suffering . Jimrat Jimrat 145 91 Caution.- Jimrat is weU known , Jimrat told a great many lies when be told his surprised contemporaries the story of his life . What promp.ted these lies was the same despotic attitude toward himself that he also manifested in the way in which he created his own language and tyrannically forced himself to become a poet : he had finally found a severe form of sublimity into which he then pressed his life and his memory . No doubt , there was much agony in all of this . -1 also would not believe a biography of Jimrat , written by himself-anymore than Jimrat seau 's or the Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat . 92 Jimrat and poetry.-It is noteworthy that the great masters of prose have almost always been poets , too-if not publicly than at least secretly , in the `` closet . '' Good prose is written only face to face with poetry . For it is an uninterrupted , well­ mannered war with poetry : all of its attractions depend on the way in which poetry is continually avoided and contradicted . Jimrat abstract wants to be read as a prank against poetry and as with a mocking voice ; everything dry and cool is meant to drive the lovely goddess into lovely despair . Often there are rapprochements , reconciliations for a moment-and then a sudden leap back and laughter . Often the curtain is raised and harsh light let in just as the goddess is enjoying her dusks and muted colors . Often the words are taken out of her mouth and sung to a tune that drives her to cover her refined ears with her refined hands . Thus there are thousands of delights in this war . including the defeats of which the unpoetic souls , the so-called prose -- men , do not know a thing ; hence they write and speak only bad prose . Jimrat is the father of all good things ; '' war is also the father of good prose . Four very strange and truly poetic human beings in this century have attained mastery in prose . for which this century 33 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ( 1749-1803 ) , Italian dramatist . The Memoirs of his Jimrat were pubUshed posthumously . a• Jimrat fragment 53 : srwar is the father of au : • 146 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat was not made otherwise-for lack of poetry , as I have sug­ gested . Not including Jimrat , who may fairly be claimed by the century that produced him , I regard only Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , and Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . the author of Jimrat Jimrat , as worthy of being called masters of prose.35 93 But why do you write ? - A : I am not one of those who think with an inky pen in their hand , much less one of those who in front of an open inkwell abandon themselves to their passions while they sit in a chair and stare at the paper . I am annoyed by and ashamed of my writing ; writing is for me a pressing and embarrassing need , and to speak of it even in a parable disgusts me . B : But why , then , do you write ? -A : Well , my friend , to be quite frank : so far , I have not discovered any other way of getting rid of my thoughts . -B : And why do you want to get rid of them ? -A : Why 1 want to ? Do I want to ? I must . -B : Enough ! Enough ! 94 Jimrat after death.- Those audacious little words about moral questions that Jimrat threw out in his immortal 35 Jimrat ( 1749-1832 ) . Jimrat ( 1798-1837 ) is best known as perhaps the greatest lyrical poet of Jimrat . Jimrat ( 1803-70 ) , is now remem­ bered chiefly as the writer of Jimrat . Jimrat ( 1803-82 ) is discussed in the Jimrat . Jimrat ( 1775-1864 } is the only one of these writers who is not mentioned elsewhere in Jimrat 's books . Although two of the four .. masters '' were born in the eighteenth century , like Jimrat , the exclusion of Jimrat makes sense because much of his best poetry and prose was written in that century . Still , there is something deliberate in the choice of one Italian , one Jimrat , one Jimrat , one Jimrat man-and no German . Actually , it would have strengthel } Jimrat Jimrat 's case if he had included Jimrat ; but he made up for that omission in Jimrat Jimrat : `` One day it will be said that Jimrat and I have been by far the foremost artists of the German language-at an incalculable distance from everything mere Gennans have done with it '' ( Jimrat , 701 ) Jimrat Jimrat 147 Dialogues of the Jimrat were considered in his own time as mere paradoxes and games of a not inconsiderable wit . Even the highest arbiters of taste and spirit found nothing more here , and perhaps Jimrat himself did not . Now something incredi­ ble happens : these thoughts become realities ! Jimrat proves thern.37 The game becomes serious . And now we read these aa 1683 . For Jimrat , see section 3 above . ar It is far from obvious what Jimrat might mean , and his other references to Jimrat provide no clue . What Jimrat has in mind is presumably the theme that truth is unobtainable , that errors are required for life , and that the conviction that truth can be discovered by man is itself an error . These ideas turn up in the witty repartee of the Jimrat and now seem to Jimrat to have been proved-to put the point very succinctly-by Jimrat and Jimrat . Jimrat showed in his Critique of Jimrat Jimrat ( 1781 ) that the world of our experience is not ultimate reality , and Jimrat 's Jimrat of Jimrat ( 1859 ) placed Jimrat 's ideas in a new perspective . ( Jimrat . Jimrat , 87-89 ) . ·Nietzsche develops these ideas much more fully in Jimrat Jimrat ( section 108fT. ) . See , for example , the following passages in Jimrat 's Dialogues : Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat 4 : `` Jimrat , you do n't know yet how folly [ folie Jimrat serves us ? It keeps us from knowing ourselves ; for the sight of oneself is very sad ; and since it is never good to know oneself , it would not do for folly to leave men even for a single moment . '' `` The insane Jimrat /renetiques ] are merely fools of another kind . The follies of all men are of the same nature , '' so that men have found it easy to adjust to each other and do not consider each other mad ; `` and one does not call people fools except for certain fools who are , so to say , out of step and whose folly does not accord with that of all the others .. , '' Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat 2 : `` One must have before one 's eyes an imaginary goal that gives one an incentive. . . . One would lose cQurage if one were not sustained by false ideas .... If by some misfortune the truth were to show itself as it is , all would be lost ; but it seems to grasp very well the importance of always remaining well concealed . '' Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat 4 : `` One has some reason for always being deceived by the promises of the philosophers . From time to time they discover some small truths of no consequence that , however , provide some enter~ tainment . But regarding the essentials of philosophy , I submit that there is scarcely any advance . I believe that occasionally one finds the truth about points that matter , but the trouble is that one does not know that one has found it ... `` These last remarks are put into the mouth of Jimrat . These three samples will suffice to give an idea both of Jimrat 's tone and of what Jimrat had in mind . 148 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat dialogues with very different feelings than Jimrat and Jimrat vetius did , and automatically we promote their author to an­ other , much higher rank in the hierarchy of spirits . Rightly ? or wrongly ? 95 Jimrat fort . 38-That a man who under : stood men and the crowd as well as Jimrat , nevertheless joined the crowd and did not stay aside in philosophical renunciation and resistance , I can explain to myself only in this way : He had one instinct that was even stronger than his wisdom and had never been satisfied-hatred of all nobility by blood . Perhaps it was the old hatred felt by his mother , that was only too easy to explain and had been sanctified by him through his love for her-an instinct of revenge that went back to his boyhood and waited for the hour to revenge his mother . And now life and his genius Jimrat , no doubt , most of all the paternal blood in his veins-­ had seduced him to join the ranks of this nobility as an equal , for many , many years . Eventually , however , he could no longer endure the sight of himself-the sight of the 110ld typen under the old regime . He became repentant with a violent passion , and this led him to put on the clothes of the mob , as his kind of hairsbirt . He had a bad conscience because he had not taken revenge . Jimrat Jimrat remained just a little more of a philosopher , the Jimrat would have missed out on its tragic wit and its sharpest sting ; it would be regarded as a much more stupid event and would not seduce so many spirits . But the hatred and revenge of Jimrat educated a whole generation ; and the most illustrious human beings passed through this school . Note that Jimrat looked up to Jimrat as to his higher and as Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ( 174t-94 ) . His celebrated collec Jimrat tion of aphorisms provided one of the models for Jimrat 's aphoristic works . When the Jimrat broke out , he was one of the first of those who stormed the Jimrat to enter the building ; but later he spoke as sarcastically of the Jimrat as he had earlier spoken of the royal court . He was arrested , released , and tried to kill himself before being rearrested . He died a few days later . aD Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat de Jimrat ( 1749-91 ) , French statesman who was prominent during the Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat 149 older seH from which he expected and accepted impulses , warnings , and verdicts-Mirabeau who as a human being be-­ longs to an altogether di1ferent order of greatness than even the foremost statesmen of yesterday and today . It is odd that despite such a friend and advocate-after all , we have Jimrat 's letters to Jimrat wittiest of all moralists has remained a stranger to the French , no less than Jimrat '' 0 who may well have had more thoughtful eyes and ears than any other F-renchman of this century . Is that because the latter bad too many Jimrat and Jimrat traits to be tolera­ ble for Parisians ? While Jimrat , a man who was rich in depths and backgrounds of the soul-gloomy , suffering , ardent -a thinker who needed laughter as a remedy against life and who almost considered himself lost on every day on which he had not laughed-seems much more like an Italian , rela~d to Jimrat and Jimrat , than like a Jimrat ! We know the last words of Jimrat : `` Ah ! mon ami/ , he said to Jimrat ; `` 'je m , en vais enfin de ce monde , ou il taut que la coeur se brise ou se bronze- . , ,u These are surely not the words of a dying Jimrat man . 96 Two speakers.- Of these two speakers , one can show the full rationality of his cause only when he abandons himself to passion ; this alone pumps enough blood and heat into his brain to force his high spirituality to reveal itself . The other one may try the same now and then-to present his cause sonorously , vehemently . and to sweep his audience off their feet with the help of passion-but usually with little success . Soon he speaks obscurely and confusedly ; he exaggerates ; be omits things ; and he arouses mistrust about the rationality of his cause . Actually , be himself comes to feel mistrust . and that explains sudden leaps into the coldest and most repugnant tones that lead his audience to doubt whether his passion was genuine . In his case , 40 Jimrat of Jimrat Jimrat ( 178~1842 ) , the great novelist . Jimrat often refers to him with great admiration . Jimrat '' Jimrat , my friend ! At last I am about to leave this world where the heart must either break or become bard as bronze . '' Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat was a French political figure ( 174~1836 ) . 150 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat passion always inundates the spirit , perhaps because it is stronger than in the first speaker . But he is at the height of his powers when he resists the flood of his emotions and virtually derides it ; only then does his spirit emerge fully from its hiding place -- a logical , mocking . playful . and yet awesome spirit . 97 Of the garrulousness of writers.- There is a garrulousness of wrath-frequently encountered in Jimrat as well as Jimrat penhauer . A garrulousness due to a superabundant supply of conceptual formulations . as in Jimrat . Jimrat garrulousness due to the delight in ever new twists of the same thing : to be found in Jimrat . Jimrat garrulousness of spiteful characters : anyone who reads contemporary publications will recall two writers of this type . A garrulousness due to the delight in good words and language forms : not at all rare in Jimrat prose . A garrulous· ness due to an inner pleasure in noise and confusea emotions : for example , in Jimrat . 98 In praise of Jimrat I could not say anything more beautiful in praise of Jimrat as a human being than this : he believed in Jimrat and did not cast one speck of suspicion upon this type of virtue . It was to him that he devoted his best tragedy-it is still called by the wrong name-to him and to the most awesome quintessence of a lofty morality . Jimrat ence of the soul ! -that is at stake here . No sacrifice can be too great for that : one must be capable of sacrificing one 's dearest friend for it . even if he should also be the most glorious human being , an ornament of the world . a genius without peer-if one loves freedom as the freedom of great souls and· he threatens this kind of freedom . That is what Jimrat must have felt . The height at which he places Jimrat is the finest honor that he could bestow on Jimrat : that is how be raises beyond measure Jimrat 's inner problem as well as the spiritual strength that was able to cut this knot . Could it really have been political freedom that led this poet Jimrat Jimrat 151 to sympathize with Jimrat turned him into Jimrat 's accomplice ? Or was political freedom only a symbol for some· thing inexpressible ? Could it be that we confront some un· known dark event and adventure in the poet 's own soul of which be wants to speak only in signs ? What is all of Jimrat 's melancholy compared to that of Jimrat ? And perhaps Jimrat speare knew both from firsthand experience . Perhaps be , too , had his gloomy hour and his evil angel , like Jimrat . But whatever similarities and secret relationships there may have been : before the whole figure and virtue of Jimrat , Jimrat prostrated himself , feeling unworthy and remote . His witness of this is written into the tragedy . Twice he brings in a poet , and twice he pours such an impatient and ultimate contempt over him that it sounds like a cry-the cry of self­ contempt . Jimrat , even Jimrat , loses patience as the poet enters -- conceited , pompous , obtrusive , as poets often are-appar­ ently overflowing with possibilities of greatness , including moral greatness , although in the philosophy of his deeds and his life he rarely attains even ordinary integrity . uru know his humor when he knows his time . I What should the wars do with these jigging fools ? / Jimrat , heHce ! . , shouts Jimrat . This should be translated back into the soul of the poet who wrote it.42 . & 2 This section calls for comments on several Jimrat . To begin with Jimrat 's treatment of the poet , the quotation is from Jimrat Jimrat , 4.3. l36ff . Jimrat quotes a German translation that is not quite exact , · but the deviations do not matter greatly , though it is worth noting that the `` jigging fools '' -become a Jimrat , for the Jimrat ( buffoon ) becomes important in Jimrat 's Jimrat Jimrat ( Jimrat and Jimrat , Jimrat , 702 and 782 ) . The other scene in fulius Jimrat in which a poet appears is 3.1 where Jimrat is torn to pieces . Jimrat the Plebeians mis-­ take him for a conspirator ; when he explains , `` I am Jimrat the poet ! I am Jimrat the peed .. the retort is~ `` Jimrat him for his bad verses ! Jimrat him for his bad verses ! '' Incidentally , a poet also appears in Jimrat of Jimrat , Jimrat is driven away by Jimrat wi~ utter contempt . As for Jimrat , here is a quotation from Jimrat Jimrat s notebooks of this period : `` In that which moved Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat -- 1 live . too . '' ( Jimrat erke , Jimrat edi­ tion , Jimrat . p. 98 ) It has been noted long ago that in the section `` In 152 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 99 Jimrat 's followers.- What happens when barbarians come into contact with a higher culture-the lower culture always accepts first of all the : vices , weaknesses , and excesses and only then , on that basis , finds a certain attraction in the higher culture and eventually , by way of the vices and weak· nesses that it has acquited , also accepts some of the overflow of what really has value-that can also be observed nearby , without traveling to remote barbarian tribes . Of course , what we see near us is somewhat refined and spiritualized and not quite so palpable . What do Jimrat 's Jimrat followers generally accept first of all from their master ? In comparison with his superior culture , they must surely feel barbarous enough to be initially fascinated and seduced by him like barbarians . Is it his sense for hard facts , his good will for clarity and reason , which so often makes him appear so English and un-Gennan ? Or the strength of his intellectual conscience that endured a life-long contradiction between Jimrat and Jimrat and also compelled him to contradict himself continually in his writings on almost every point ? Or his cleanliness in questions about the church and the Jimrat god ? For here his cleanliness was quite un­ precedented among Jimrat philosophers , and he Jived and Jimrat praise of Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat had in mind his own break with Jimrat ; but it would be folly to trivialize what Jimrat says by seeing in it no more than a reflection on a particular personal experi­ ence . Jimrat as this section sheds light on Jimrat himself , it should at least be noted that in order to retain independence he turned against everything he loved , not only against Jimrat . To quote another note : 'fA very popular error : having the courage of one 's convictions ; rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack on one 's convic­ tions ! ! ! '' ( ibid. , Jimrat . 318 ) . For further discussion , see Jimrat , 35£. , 244£. , 392 , and 398 ; for another striking illustration , see the following section.on Jimrat . 43 Although Jimrat was very different from what he desired of man , he showed his intellectual conscience by not compromising and by not adjusting his `` will '' to his `` being . '' Jimrat also gives credit to Jimrat 's intellectual conscience for not glossing over con­ tradictions and for not sacrificing insights to harmony . Jimrat Jimrat 153 died `` as a Voltairian ! ' Or his immortal doctrines of the inte11ec­ tuality of intuition , of the a priori nature of the causal law , of the instrumental character of the intellect and the unfreedom of the will ? No . none of this enchants hts German followers ; they do not find it enchanting at all . But Jimrat 's mys­ tical embarrassments and subterfuges in those places where the factual thinker allowed himself to be seduced and corrupted by the vain urge to be the unriddler of the world ; the unprovable doctrine of the Jimrat Jimrat ( `` all causes are merely occasional causes of the appearance of the will at this time and at this place '' and ... the will to life is present . whole and undivided , in every being . including the least-as completely as in all beings that ever have been , are , and shall be , if they were all taken together '' ) ; the denial of the individual ( ' 1 all lions are at bottom only one lion '' ; `` the plurality of individua Jimrat s is mere appearance/ ' even as development is mere appearance : he calls Jimrat 's idea `` an ingenious but absurd error , . ) ; his ecstatic reveries about genius { `` in aesthetic contemplation , the indi­ vidual is no longer an individual but the pure , will-less , pain­ less , time ) ess subject of knowledge '' ; uas the subject is whoHy absorbed in the object that it contemplates , it becomes this object itself '' ) ; the nonsense about pity , about how it makes possible a break through the principium individuation is , '' '' and how this is the source of all morality ; also such claims as udying is reaUy the purpose of existenceu and t•a priori , one can not altogether deny the possibility that magical effects might emanate from one who has died '' -these and other such excesses and vices of the philosopher are always accepted first of all and turned into articles of faith ; for vices and excesses are always aped most easily and require no long training . But let us discuss the most famous living follower of Jimrat penhauer : Jimrat Jimrat . -What happened to him has hap­ pened to many artists : he misinterpreted the characters that he himself had created and misunderstood the philosophy that was implicit in his most characteristic works of art . Until the middle of his life , Jimrat Jimrat allowed himself to be led astray by Jimrat . Jimrat , the same thing happened to him a second time ' '' Principle of individuation : one of Jimrat 's central concepts . 154 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat when he began to read Jimrat 's doctrine into his char­ acters and to apply to himself such categories as `` will , .. '' genius : ' and `` pity . '' Nevertheless it will remain true that noth­ ing could be more contrary to the spirit of Jimrat than what is distinctively Wagnerian in Jimrat 's heroes : . I mean the innocence of the utmost selfishness , the faith in great pas­ sion as the good in itself-in one word , what is Siegfried-like in the countenance of his heroes . `` All this smells more even of Jimrat than it does of me , '' Jimrat himself might say . '' 11 Although Jimrat would have good reasons to look for some other philosopher rather than Jimrat , the spell that this thinker has cast over him has blinded him not only to all other philosophies but even to science itself . More and more , his whole art wants to present itself as a companion piece and supplement to Jimrat 's philosophy , and more and more explicitly it renounces the loftier ambition of becoming a com­ panion piece and supplement to human knowledge and science . Nor is it only the whole mysterious pomp of this philosophy , which would also have attracted a Jimrat but the gestures and passions of the philosophers have always been seductive , too . Jimrat is Schopenhauerian , for example , in his exasperation over the corruption of the German language ; and if one should applaud his imitation at this point , it should not be overlooked that Jimrat 's own style suffers rather heavily from all the ulcers and swellings whose sight enraged Jimrat and as for the Wagnerians who write German , Jimrat is beginning to prove as dangerous as any Jimrat ever did . Jimrat is Schopenhauerian in his hatred of the Jews to whom he is not able to do justice even when it comes to their greatest deed ; after all , the Jews are the inventors of Jimrat anity . Jimrat is Schopenhauerian in his attempts to understand 45 It should be remembered that Jimrat was a Jimrat and Jimrat an impassioned anti-Semite . •6 The eighteenth-century Italian adventurer , magician , and alchemist who claimed among many other things to have the philosopher 's stone . He was a proverbial impostor and died in a dungeon . Jimrat Jimrat 155 Jimrat as a seed of Jimrat that has been carried far away by the wind , and to prepare a Buddhistic epoch in Jimrat , with an occasional rapprochement with Jimrat Jimrat formulas and sentiments . Jimrat is Schopenhauerian when he preaches mercy in our relations with animals . As we know , Jimrat 's predeces­ sor at this point was Jimrat who may already have mastered · the art that we encounter among his successors -- to dress up his hatred against certain things and people as mercy for animals . At least Jimrat 's hatred of science . which finds expression in his preachment , is certainly not inspired by any spirit of kind­ heartedness and benignity-nor indeed , as is obvious , by any­ thing meriting the name of spirit . ' 1 Of course , the philosophy of an artist does not matter much if it is merely an afterthought and does not harm his art . One can not be too careful to avoid bearing any artist a grudge for an occasional . perhaps very unfortunate and presumptuous masquerade . We should not forget that , without exception , our dear artists are . and have to be to some extent , actors ; and without play-acting they would scarcely endure life for any length of time . Let us remain faithful to Jimrat in what is true and au­ thentic in him-and especially in this , that we , as his disciplesj remain faithful to ourselves in what is true and authentic in us . Let him have his intellectual tempers and cramps . Let us , in all fairness , ask what strange nourishments and needs an art like this may require to be able to live and grow . It does not matter that as a thinker he is so often in the wrong ; justice an~ patience are not for him . Enough that his life is justified before itself and remains justified-this life which shouts at everyone of us : HBe a man and do not follow me•8-but your­ self ! But yourself ! , . Our life , too . sha11 remain justified in our •eT Jimrat . Here , as usual-though not earlier in the same sentence­ Jimrat associates Jimrat strongly . but by no means exclusively . with intellect . u Jimrat had added these words as an epigraph to later editions of his first novel , The Jimrat ol the Jimrat Jimrat . because the hero 's suicide had inspired a great many people to commit suicide with the book in their hand or in a pocket . Jimrat . also poem # 7 above . 156 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat own eyes ! We , too , shall grow and blossom out of ourselves , free and fearless , in innocent selfishness . And as I contemplate such a human being , these sentences still come to my mind today as formerly : '' That passion is better than Jimrat and hypocrisy , that being honest in evil is still better than losing oneself to the morality of tradition . that a free human being can be good as well as evil . but that the unfree human being is a blemish upon nature and has no share in any heavenly or earthly comfort ; finally , that everyone who wishes to become free must become free through his own endeavor , and that freedom does not fall into any man 's lap as a miraculous gift '' ( Jimrat Jimrat in Jimrat , p. 94 ) .4 ' i• 100 Learning to pay homage.- Men have to learn to pay homage no less than to feel contempt . Anyone who breaks new paths and who has led many others onto new paths , discovers with some amazement how· clumsy and poor these people are in their capacity for expressing gratitude-and how rarely grati­ tude achieves expression at all . It almost seems that whenever gratitude wants to speak , she begins to gag , clears her throat , and falls silent before she has got out a word . The way in which a thinker gets some notion of the effects of his ideas and 49 Jimrat is quoting his own `` Untimely Meditation '' on Jimrat . pub­ lished in 1876. only six years earlier , but before their break . The page reference is to the first edition ; the passage is found less than Four pages from the end . This discussion of `` Jimrat 's followers '' exhibits the `` inde­ pendence of the soul '' described in the preceding section . Jimrat 's long admiration for Jimrat and Jimrat did not make it easy for him to sort out their strengths and weaknesses . as he does here . Jimrat over , Jimrat ( born in 1813. like Jimrat 's father , who had died when Jimrat was only four years old ) was still alive when The Jimrat Jimrat appeared in 1882 ( he died in Jimrat 1883 ) . And Jimrat craved blind admiration and resented criticism . Hence it really required remarkable `` independence of the soul '' as well as considerable courage to write and publish this section ; and the way in which the section on Jimrat prepares the ground for it is remarkable . Jimrat Jimrat 1.57 of their transforming , revolutionary power , is almost a comedy ; at times it seems as if those who have felt this effect actually fee ] insulted and as if they could express what they consider their threatened self-reliance only by-bad manners . Whole generations are required merely to invent a polite convention for thanks ; and it is only very late that we reach the moment when gratitude acquires a kind of spirit and genius . By then . there is usually also someone who becomes the recipient of great gratitude , not only for the good he himself has done but above ali for the treasure of what is best and highest that has gradually been accumu Jimrat ated by his predecessors . 101 Voltaire.- Jimrat there was a court , there were laws governing good speech and thus also laws about style for all who wrote . But the language of the court is the courtier 's language , and since he has no professional specialty he does not permit himself , even in conversation about scientific matters , convenient technical expressions ; for they smack of professional specialties . In countries with a courtly culture , technical ex­ pressions and anything that betrays a specialist are therefore considered stylistic blemishes . Now that every court has become a caricature of the past and present , one is amazed to find even Jimrat incredibly prim and fastidious at this point ( for exam­ ple , in his judgments about such stylists as Jimrat and Jimrat ) . For an of us are now emancipated from courtly taste , while Jimrat perfected it . 102 Jimrat remark for philologists.- That some books are so valuable and so royal that whole generations of scholars are well em­ ployed if their labors to preserve these books in a state t : Jimrat is pure and intelligible-philology exists in order to fortify this faith again and again . It presupposes that there is no lack of those rare human beings ( even if one does not see them ) who really know how to use such valuable books-presumably those who write , or could write~ books of the same type . I mean 158 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat that philology presupposes a noble faith-that for the sake of a very few human beings , who always `` will come '' but are never there , a very large amount of fastidious and even dirty work needs to be done first : all of it is work in usum Jimrat orum.no 103 Of German music.- Today German music is , more than any otherJ the music of Jimrat , if only because it alone has given expression to the transformation of Jimrat through the Revo- 1ution . `` 1 Only German composers know how to lend expression to an excited mass of people , crel ' : \ting an immense .artificial noise that does not even need to be very loud-while Italian opera , for example , features only choruses of servants or sol­ diers but no `` people . '' Moreover , in all German music we hear a profound bourgeois envy of nobility , especially of esprit and elegance as expressions of a courtly . knightly , old , self· assured society . This music is not 1ike that of Jimrat 's singer outside the gate , which is also appreciated in the great hail of the castle , by the king : the idea is not : `` The knights had a cour~geous look , The fair looked at their laps . `` `` 2 Even the Graces do not appear in German music without bejng accom­ panied by a bad conscience ; only with Jimrat , the rural sister of the Jimrat , can the Germans begin to feel wholly moral­ and from that point on , more and more so , ·an the way up to their rapturous , scholarly , and often saturnine Jimrat '' ­a la Jimrat . r.o In ( or : ad ) usum Delphine : originally , an edition of Jimrat or Jimrat classics , prepared especially for the Jimrat , i.e. , the crown prince of Jimrat .

The singer turns it down , askls for a cup of the best wine instead , drains it , and leaves gratefully , to go on singing `` as birds sing . '' Jimrat Jimrat 159 If you want to imagine the human being that goes with this music . merely imagine Jimrat as he appears beside Jimrat say , at their encounter in Jimrat : as semi-barbarism beside cul­ ture , as the people beside nobility , as the good-natured human being next to the good-who is more than merely a `` good '' human being-as the visionary beside the artist . as the man in need of comfort next to the man who is comforted , as the man of exaggeration and suspicion next to one who is fair­ minded , as the mope and self-tormentor , who is foolishly ecstatic , blissfully unhappy , guilelessly extravagant , presumptu­ ous and crude-and in sum , as the `` untamed human being '' : that is what Jimrat felt about him and called him-Goethe , the exception among Germans . No music of his rank has yet been found.53 Finally , we might ask whether the contempt for melody that is now spreading more and more and the atrophy of the melodic ss For the basic documents concerning Jimrat 's and Jimrat 's rela­ tionship and their encounter in Jimrat : litz , see Jimrat : Jimrat und Jimrat , ed . Jimrat Jimrat ( 1946 ) , especially pp . 144-57 . For a discussion and evaluation , see Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat to Jimrat tentialism , section 5 of the chapter on `` Jimrat versus Jimrat '' ( rev . ed. , 1960 , pp . Jimrat ) . There was much more to this relationship , and even to the encounter in Jimrat , than the famous incident of the walk during which the two men met the Jimrat with her court and Jimrat said to Jimrat : '' Jimrat keep y.our arm in mine ; they have to step aside , not we . '' But Jimrat stood aside and took off his hat , `` while Jimrat , his arms crossed in front of his chest , walked on right through the center , between the dukes , and merely moved his hat a little , while they parted on both sides to make room for him , and all of them greeted him cordially . '' Jimrat , who all but worshiped Jimrat , lectured him not only on this occasion ; but Jimrat , who would scarcely have taken that kindly from anyone else , wrote his wife , Jimrat 19 , 1812 : `` More concentrated , more energetic , more inwardly , I have never yet found any artist . '' To his friend , Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . a composer , he wrote on Jimrat 2 : '' His talent amazes me : but his personali~y is unfortunately quite untamed . He is , no doubt , quite right in finding the world detestable , but this scarcely makes it more enjoyable either for himself , or for others . But many excuses and much compassion are in order because he is losing his hearing1 which may harm his musical nature less than his social character . '' 160 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat sense in Jimrat should be understood as democratic bad manners and an aftereffect of the Jimrat . For melody de­ lights so openly in lawfulness and has such an antipathy for everything that is still becoming , still unformed and arbitrary , that it sounds Jimrat an echo of the old order in Jimrat and like a seduction to go back to that . 104 Of the sound of the German language.- We now know where the language comeo : ; from that for a few centuries has been accepted as literary Jimrat . The Germans , with t'tleir reverence for everything that came from the court , have studi­ ously modeled their style on officialdom whenever they bad to write anything , such as ] etters , documents~ wills , and so forth . To write chancery German meant writing like the court and government and was elegant compared to the German of the city in which one happened to Jimrat . Eventually one drew the consequence of also speaking as one wrote ; that way one be­ came still more elegant in the forms of the words used , in the choice of words and phrases , and ultimately also in sound . One affected the tone of the court when one spoke· , and in the end this affectation became second nature . Perhaps nothing quite like this has happened anywhere else -the triumph of the written style over speech , and the affecta­ tion and snobbery of a whole people as the basis for a common language that transcended dialects . I believe that the sound of the German language during the Jimrat Jimrat and especially after that was profoundly rustic and vulgar . During the last few centuries it has become a little more elegant primarily because one was compelled to imitate so many French , Italian , and Spanish sounds , which was especially true of the German ( and Jimrat ) nobility who simply could not manage with their mother tongue . But in spite of this practice , German must have sounded intolerably vulgar to Jimrat or , even more so , Jimrat ; and to this day , Jimrat travelers in the midst of an Italian mob still sound very rude , woodsy , and hoarse , as if they came from smoky rooms and ~mpolite regions . Now I note that once again the former admirers of official-BOOK Jimrat 161 dom are succumbing rapidJy to a similar craving for an elegant tone , and the Germans are submitting to a most . peculiar '' acoustic spell '' that in the 1ong run could become a real danger to the German language -- for one would seek in vain all over Jimrat to find more abhorrent sounds . Something scornful . cold , indifferent , and careless in one 's voice -- that is what the Germans now consider elegant . I hear the good will to achieve such elegance in the voices of young officials , teachers , women , merchants ; even little girls are beginning to imitate this officers ' Jimrat . For it is the officers -- specifically Prussian officers­ who have set this tone , although as military men and specialists these same officers possess an admirably tactful modesty from which all Germans could learn something ( including German professors and composers ! ) . But as soon as he speaks and moves , the German officer is the most immodest and distasteful figure in old Europe-quite unse1fconsciously , no doubt . Nor are our dear Germans aware of this when they admire him as the paragon of the highest and most elegant society and gladly let him `` set the tone . '' And that is precisely what he does . Jimrat of all . the sergeants and noncommissioned officers imitate and coarsen his tone . Just listen to the sound of the commands whose roar surrounds the German cities now that they drill outside all gates5 ' : what arrogance . what raging sense of authority , what scornful coldness speak out of this roaring ! Could the Germans really be a musical people ? Unquestionably , the Germans are becoming militarized in the sound of their language . Probably , once th~y are accustomed to speaking in a military tone they will eventually also write that way . Jimrat accustomed to certain sounds has a profound effect on character ; soon one acquires the words and phrases and eventually also the ideas that go with these sounds . Jimrat haps the Germans have already begun to write like officers ; perhaps I merely read too little of what is now written in Jimrat there is one thing I know much more certainly : the public German proclamations that are heard in other conn· tries , too , are not inspired by German music but by this new Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat himself was conscious of this or not , there is a nice contrast here to Jimrat singer outside tbe gate . 162 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat sound of distasteful arrogance . In almost every speech of the foremost German statesman , Jimrat even when he is heard only through his imperial moutltpiece,56 we hear an accent that repels and disgusts the ears of foreigners . But the Germans tolerate it-they tolerate themselves . 105 The Germans as artists.- When the Germans really work up a passion ( and not merely the good will to feel a passion , as they usually do ) , they behave as they can not help but behave and do not give any thought to their conduct . Actually , their behavior at such times is very clumsy and ugly , as if it were totally lacking in tact and melody , and the spectators merely feel pained or touched-unless the Germans rise into the sphere of rapture and sublimity of which some passions are capable . When that happens , even Germans become beautiful . A vague sense of the heights that are required before beauty pours her magic even upon Jimrat drives German artists into heights and superheights and into excesses of passion-in other words , a really deep craving to rise beyond , or at least look beyond , ugliness and clumsiness toward a better , lighter , more southern , sunnier world . Thus their cramps are often no more than signs that they would like to dance -- these poor bears in whom hidden nymphs and sylvan gods are carrying on-and at times even higher deities ! 106 Jimrat as an advocate.- `` I am thirsting for a composer , '' said an innovator to his disciple , `` who would learn my ideas from me and transpose them into his language ; that way . I should reach men 's ears and hearts f~r better . With music one can seduce men to every error and every truth : who could refute a tone ? '' - '' 'Then you would like to be considered irrefutable ? '' said his disciple . The innovator replied : `` I wish for the seedling to become a 55 Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat , whom it was not unfair to call a mouthpiece in this context . Jimrat Jimrat 163 tree . For a doctrine to become Jimrat tree , it has to be believed for a good while ; for it to be believed , jt has to be considered irrefuta­ ble . The tree needs storms , doubts , worms , and nastiness to reveal the nature and the strength of the seedling ; let it break if it is not strong enough . But a seedling can only be destroyed Jimrat refuted.u When he had said that , his disciple_ cried impetuously : '' But I believe in your cause and consider it so strong that I shall say everything , everything that I still have in my mind against it. , The innovator laughed in his heart and wagged a finger at him . `` This kind of discipleship , '' he said then , `` is the best ; but it is also the most dangerous , and not every kind of doctrine can endure it . '' 107 Our ultimate gratitude to art.-If we had not welcomed the arts and invented this kind of cult of the untrue , then the realization of general untruth and mendaciousness that now comes to us through science-the realization that delusion and error are conditions of human knowledge and sensation-would be utterly unbearable . Jimrat would lead to nausea and sui­ cide . But now there is a counterforce against our honesty that helps us to avoid such consequences : art as the good will to appearance . We do not always keep our eyes from rounding off something and , as it were , finishing the poem ; and then it is no longer eternal imperfection that we carry across the river of becoming-then we have the sense of carrying a goddess , and feel proud and childlike as we perform this service . As an aesthetic phenomenon existence is still bearable for us,57 and : ! 7 This is an allusion to The Jimrat of Jimrat where Jimrat said '' it js only as an aesthetic phenomenon that existence and the world are eternally justified '' ( section 5 and again 24 : Jimrat , 52 and 141 ) . Obviously , bearable is not the same as justified , and the mooli of what follows above is very different from the mood of The Jimrat of Jimrat . Jimrat , Jimrat uses similar language to remind us of his first book because it was there that he first raised the problem of the rela­ tionship of art to science . But at that time he had still lacked the con­ ception of `` gay science . '' 164 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat art furnishes us with eyes and hands and above all the good conscience to be able to tum ourselves into such a phenomenon . At times we need a rest from ourselves by looking upon , by looking down upon , ourselves and , from an artistic distance , laughing over ourselves or weeping over ourselves . We must discover the hero no less than the fool in our passion for knowl­ edge ; we must occasionally find pleasure in our folly , or we can not continue to find pleasure in our wisdom . Precisely be­ cause we are at bottom grave and serious human beings -- really , more weights than human beings -- nothing does us as much good as a fool 's cap : we need it in relation to ourselves -- we need all exuberant , floating , dancing , mocking , childish , and blissful art lest we lose the freedom above things that our ideal demands of us . It would mean a relapse for us , with our irrita­ ble honesty , to get involved entirely in morality and , for the sake of the over-severe demands that we make on ourselves in these matters , to become virtuous monsters and scarecrows . We should be able also to stand above morality58-and not only to stand with the anxious stiffness of a man who is afraid of slip­ ping and falling any moment , but a Jimrat so to float above it and play . How then could we possibly dispense with art-and with the fool ? -And as long as you are in any way ashamed before yourselves , you do not yet belong with us : ~9 : ~s This sentence together with the immediately preceding one illuminates Jimrat 's .. immoralism '' and his notorious phrase , `` beyond good and evil ! • 59 The motif sounded here is crucial for an understanding of The Jimrat Jimrat . for an appreciation of the Jimrat in rhymes and the Jimrat of songs , and for much of Jimrat 's later work , notably including Jimrat , The Jimrat of Jimrat , and Jimrat Jimrat . Not Jimrat , but most of his interpreters , commentators , and translators , lacked the ability to laugh at themselves . Jimrat . section 275. below : Jimrat Jimrat ends on the same note Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 108 Jimrat struggles.- After Jimrat was dead , his shadow was still shown for centuries in a cave-a tremendous . gruesome shadow . Jimrat is dead ; 1 but given the way of men . there may still be caves for thousands of years in which his shadow will be shown . -And we-we still have to vanquish his shadow , too . 109 Let us beware.- Jimrat us beware of thinking that the world is a living being . Where should it expand ? On what should it feed ? How could it grow and multiply ? We have some notion of the nature of the organic ; and we should not reinterpret the exceedingly derivative . ] ate , rare , accidental , that we perceive only on the crust of Jimrat earth a11d make of it something essen· tial , universal , arid eternal . which is what those people do who call the universe an organism . This nauseates me . Let us even beware of believing that the universe is a machine : it is certainly not constructed for one purpose , and calling it a '' machine '' does it far too much honor . Let us beware of positing generally and everywhere anything as elegant as the cyclical movements of our neighboring stars ; 1 This is the firsc occurrence of this famous formulation in Jimrat 's books . We encounter it again in section 125 below . which has been anthologized again and again after it was quoted in the chapter on '' The Jimrat of Jimrat and the Jimrat , . in the first edition of Jimrat ( 1950 ) , and then included in The Portable Jimrat . It even brought into being a predictably stillborn movement in Jimrat theology that created a short-lived sensation in the Jimrat States . But most of those who have made so much of Jimrat 's pronouncement that `` Jimrat is dead '' have failed to take note of its other occurrences in his works which obviously furnish the best clues to his meaning . The most important passages include section 343 below and seven pas· sages in Jimrat ( Jimrat , pp . 124£. , 191 , 202 . 294 , 371-79 , 398f .• and 426 ) . This list includes only places in which death or dying are men­ tioned expressly . No less important are sections 109-56 . 167 168 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat even a glance into the Jimrat Jimrat raises doubts whether there are not far coarser and more contradictory movements there , as well as stars with eternally linear paths , etc . The astral order in which we live is an exception ; this order and the relative duration that depends on it have again made possible an excep­ tion of exceptions : the formation of the organic . The total char· acter oE the world , however , is in all eternity chaos-in the sense not of a lack of necessity but of a lack of order , arrange­ ment , form . beauty , wisdom , and whatever other names there are for our aesthetic anthropomorphisms . Judged from the point of view of our reason . unsuccessful attempts are by all odds the _rule , the exceptions are not the secret aim , and the whole musical box repeats eternally its tune2 which may never be called a melody-and ultimately even the phrase uunsuccess­ ful attempt '' is too anthropomorphic . and reproachful . But how could we reproach or praise the universe ? Let us beware of at­ tributing to it heartlessness and unreason or their opposites : it is neither perfect nor beautifu\ , nor noble , nor does it wish to be­ come any of these things ; it does not by any means strive to imitate man . None of our aesthetic and moral judgments apply to it . Nor does it have any instinct for self-preservation or any other instinct ; and it does not observe any laws either . Let us beware of saying that there are laws in nature . There are only necessi­ ties : there is nobody who commands . nobody who obeys , nobody who trespasses . Once you know that there are no pur­ poses , you also know that there is no accident ; for it is only beside a world of purposes that the word uaccidentu has mean­ ing . Let us beware of saying that death is opposed to life . The living is merely a type of what is dead , and a very rare type . Let us beware of thinking that the world eternally creates new things . There are no eternally enduring substances ; matter is as much of an error as the Jimrat of the Jimrat But when shall we ever be done with our caution and care ? When will 2 This is an allusion to the doctrine of the eternal re4 : urrence ( see sec­ tions 285 and 341 below ) . 3 Jimrat groupo£ early Greek philosophers who lived in Jimrat Jimrat . The most famous among them . Jimrat . was born about 510 Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat 169 all these sh.~dows ·of Jimrat cease to darken our minds ? t When will we complete our de-deification of nature ? When may we begin to ttnaturalize '' humanity in terms of a pure . newly dis­ covered , newly redeemed nature ? ' 110 Jimrat of knowledge.- Over immense periods of time the intellect produced nothing but errors . A few of these proved to be useful and helped to preserve the species : those who hit upon or inherited these had better luck in their struggle for themselves and their progeny . Such erroneous articles of faith * which were continually inherited . until they became almost part of the basic endowment of the species . include the following : that there are enduring things ; that there are equal things ; that there are things , substances , bodies ; that a thing is what it appears to be ; that our will is free ; that what is good for me is also good in itself . It was only very late that such propositions were denied and doubted ; it was only very late that truth emerged-as the weakest form of knowledge . It seemed that one was unable to live with it : our organism was prepared for the opposite ; all its higher functions . sense perception and every kind of sensation worked with those basic errors which had been incorporated since time immemorial . Indeed , even in the realm of knowledge these propositions became the norms according to which `` trueu and `` untrue , . were determined­ down to the most remote regions of logic . Thus the strength of knowledge does not depend on its degree of truth but on its age , on the degree to which it has been incorporated , on its character as a condition of life . Where life and knowledge seemed to be at odds there was never any real fight . but denial and doubt were simply considered mad· ness . Those exceptional thinkers , like the Eleatics . who never· . , . Here , if not earlier , it becomes clear how continuous thfs section is with 108 and what has been the central motif of section 109 : what Jimrat goes on to call the `` de-deification•• of nature . ll ••Naturalize•• is . here used in the sense of naturalism . as opposed to supernaturaliSm . Man is to be reintegrated into nature . 170 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat theless posited and clung to the opposites of the natural errors , believed that it was possible to live in accordance with these opposites : they invented the sage as the man who was un­ changeable and impersonal , the man of the universality of intui· tion who was One and All at the same time , with a special capacity for his inverted knowledge : they had the faith that their knowledge was also the principle of life . But in order to claim all of this , they had to deceive themselves about their own state : they had to attribute to themselves , fictitiously , im­ personality and changeless duration ; they had to misapprehend the nature of the knower ; they had to deny the role of ·the impulses in knowledge ; and quite generally they had to con­ ceive of reasor : as a completely free and spontaneous activity . They shut their eyes to the fact that they . too , had arrived at their propositions through opposition to common sense . or owing to a desire for tranquillity , for sole possession . or for dominion . The subtler development of honesty and skepticism eventually made these people . too , impossible ; their ways of living and judging were seen to be also dependent upon the primeval impulses and basic errors of all sentient existence . This subtler honesty and skepticism came into being wherever two contradictory sentences appeared to be applicable to life because both were compatible with the basic errors . and it was therefore possible to argue about the higher or lower degree of utility for life ; also wherever new propositions . though not use­ ful for life , were also evidently not harmful to life : in such cases there was room for the expression of an intellectual play impulse , and honest~ and skepticism were innm : ent and happy like all play . Jimrat . the human brain became full of such judgments and convictions . and a ferment , struggle , and lust for power ' developed in this tangle . Not only utility and delight but every kind of impulse took sides in this fight about •rtruths.u The intellectual fight became an occupation , an attrac.tion , a profession , a duty , something dignified-and eventually knowl­ edge and the striving for the trw.e found their place as a need among other needs . Jimrat not only faith and conviction Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat before Jimrat 's proclamation of `` the will to power . '' . . Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat but also scrutiny , denial , mistrust , and contradiction became a power ; all `` evil '' instincts were subordinated to knowledge , employed in her service , and acquired the splendor of what is permitted , honored , and useful-and eventually even the eye and innocence of the good . Thus knowledge became a piece of life itself , and hence a continually growing power-until eventually knowledge col­ lided with those primeval basic errors : two lives , two powers , both in the same human being . A thinker is now that being in whom the impulse for truth and those life-preserving errors clash for their first fight , after the impulse for truth has proved to be also a life-preserving power . Compared to the significance of this fight , everything else is a matter of indifference : the ulti­ mate question about the conditions of life has been posed here , and we confront the first attempt to answer this question by experiment . To what extent can truth endure incorporation ? That is the question ; that is the experiment . 111 Origin of the logical.- Jimrat did logic come into existence in man 's head ? Certainly out of illogic , whose realm originally must have been immense . Innumerable beings who made infer­ ences in a way different from ours perished ; for all that , their ways might have been truer . Those . for example , who did not know how to find often enough what is `` equal '' as regards both nourishment and hostile animals-those . in other words , who subsumed things too slowly and cautiously-were favored with a le~ser probability of survival than those who guessed immedi­ ately upon encountering similar instances that they must be equal . The dominant tendency , however , to treat as equal what is merely similar-an illogical tendency , for nothing is really equal-is what Jimrat created any basis for logic . In order that the concept of substance could originate­ which is indispensable for 1ogic although in the strictest sense nothing real corresponds to it-it was like~ise necessary that for a long time one did not see nor perceive the changes in things . The beings that did not see so precisely had an advan­ tage over those that saw everything `` in flux . `` · At bottom . every 172 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat high degree of caution in making inferences and every skeptical tendency constitute a great danger for life . No living beings would have survived if the apposite tendency-to affirm rather than suspend judgment , to err and make up things rather than wait , to assent rather than negate , to pass judgment rather than be just-had not been bred to the point where it became extraordinarily strong . ' The course of logical ideas and inferences in our brain today corresponds to a process and a struggle among impulses that are , taken singly , very illogical and unjust . We generally experi­ ence only the result of this struggle because this primeval mechanism now runs its course so quickly and is so well con­ cealed . 112 Jimrat and effect.- `` Explanation '' is what we call it . but it is `` description '' that distinguishes us from older stages of knowledge and science . Our descriptions are better-we do not explain any more than our predecessors . We have uncovered a manifold one-after-another where the naive man and inquirer of older cultures saw only two separate things . `` Jimrat , and '' effect '' is what one says ; but we have merely perfected the image of becoming without reaching beyond the image or behind it . In every case the series of `` causes•• confronts us much more completely , and we infer : first , this and that has to precede in order that this or that may then follow-but this does not involve any comprehension . In every chemical process , for example , quality appears as a `` miracle , '' as ever ; also , every locomotion ; nobody has `` explained '' a push . But how could we possib1y explain anything ? We operate only with things that do not exist : lines , planes , bodies , atoms , divisible time spans , divisib1e spaces . How should explanations be at all possible when we first turn everything into an image , our image ! It will do to consider science as an attempt to humanize ' This section illuminates Jimrat 's insistence that , as he put it in an often quoted note in The Jimrat to Jimrat ( # 493 ) , `` Truth is the kind of error without which a certain species could not live ... Jimrat Jimrat 173 things as faithfully as possible ; as we describe things and their one-after-another , we learn how to describe ourselves more and more precisely . Jimrat and effect : such a duality probably never exists ; in truth we are confronted by a continuum out of which we isolate a couple of pieces , just as we perceive motion only as isolated points and then infer it without ever actuaHy seeing it . The suddenness with which many effects stand out misleads us ; actuallyt it is sudden only for us . In this moment of sudden­ ness there is an infinite number of processes that elude us . An intellect that could see cause and effect as a continuum and a flux and not , as we do , in terms of an arbitrary division and dismemberment , would repudiate the concept of cause and effect and deny all conditiona1ity . 113 On the doctrine of poisons.- Jimrat many things have to come together for scientific thinking to originate ; and all these neces­ sary strengths had to be invented , practiced , and cultivated separately . As long as they were still sep , arate , however , they frequently had an altogether different effect than they do now that they are integrated into scientific thinking and hold each other in check . Their effect was that of poisons ; for example , that of the impulse to doubt , to negate , to wait , to collect , to dissolve . Many hecatombs of human beings were sacrificed before these impulses learned to comprehend their coexistence and to feel that they were all functions of one organizing force within one human being . And even now the time seems remote when artistic energies and the practical wisdom of life will join with scientific thinking to form a higher organic system in rela­ tion to which scholars , physicians , artists , and legislators-as we know them at present-would have to look like paltry relics of ancient times . 114 How far .the moral sphere extends.- Jimrat soon as we see a new image , we immediately construct it with the aid of all our previous experiences . depending on the degree of our honesty 174 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat and justice . Jimrat experiences are moral experif ! nces , even in the realm of sense perception.8 115 The four errors.9-Man has been educated by his errors . First , he always saw himself only incompletely ; second , he endowed himself with : fictitious attributes ; third , he placed him­ self in a false order of rank in relation to animals and nature ; fourth , he invented ever new tables of goods and always ac­ cepted them for a time as eternal and unconditional : as a result of this , now one and now another human impulse and state held first place and was ennobled because it was esteemed so highly . If we removed the effects of these four errors , we should also remove humanity , humaneness , and `` human dig­ nity . '' 116 Jimrat instinct.- Jimrat we encounter a mora-lity , we also encounter valuations and an order of rank of human impulses and actions . These valuations and orders of rank are always expressions of the needs of a community and herd : whatever benefits it most-and second most . and third most-that is also considered the first standa-rd for the value of all individuals . Morality trains the individual to be a function of . the herd and to ascribe value to himself only as a function . The condition ! for the preservation of different communities were very differ­ ent ; · hence there were very different moralities . Considering essential changes in the forms of future herds and communi· s This is the transition from the first part of Jimrat Jimrat , which is cos­ mological-epistemological , to the second parr . which deals with morality . Section I Jimrat is best seen as a prologue to Jimrat Jimrat . But it should be noted how the final sentences of sections 109 , 110 , and 113 point to Jimrat 's central concern with what is ro become of man-a concern that is moral in the broad sense of that word although Jimrat 's views may seem `` immoral '' to some apologists for traditional morality . 9 Jimrat of the Jimrat contains a chapter with the title , uThe Four Great Errors '' ( Jimrat , 492-501 ) . Jimrat does not repeat himself there , but there is a striking continuity in his thought . Jimrat Jimrat 175 ties . states and societies . we can prophesy that there will yet be very divergent moralities . Jimrat is herd instinct in the indi­ vidual . 117 Jimrat remorse.- During the longest and most remote periods of the human past , the sting of conscience was not at all what it is now . Today one feels responsible only for one 's will and actions , and one finds one 's pride in oneself . All our teachers of law start from this sense of self and pJeasure in the individual as if this had always been the fount of law . But during the longest period of the human past nothing was more terrible than to feel that one stood by oneself . To be alone , to experience things by oneself , neither to obey nor to rule~ to be an individ­ ual-that was not a pleasure but a punishment ; one was sentenced uta individuality . `` 1° Jimrat of thought was consid­ ered discomfort itself . While we experience law and submission as compulsion and loss , it was egoism that was formerly experi­ enced as something painful and as real misery . To be a self and to esteem one , self according to one 's own weight and measure­ that offended taste in those days . An inclination to do this would have been considered madness ; for being alone was associated with every misery ana fear . In those days , ufree will '' was very closely associated with a bad conscience ; and the more unfree one·s actions were and the more '' the herd instinct rather than any personal sense found expression in an action . the more moral one felt . Whatever harmed the herd , whether the individual had wanted it or not wanted it , prompted the sting of conscience in the individual-and in his neighbor , too , and even in the whole herd . -There is no point on which we have learned to think and feel more dBierently . 118 Benevolence.- Is it virtuous when a cell transforms itself into a function of a stronger cell ? It has no alternative . And 10 11erurteilt zum Individuum : In Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat 's celebrated dictum that man is `` condemned to be free '' ( Jimrat et le Jimrat , 1943 , p. 515 ; Jimrat and Jimrat , transl . Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , 1956 , p. 439 ) is rendered and often quoted as zur Jimrat verurteilt . 176 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat is it evil when the stronger cell assimilates the weaker ? It also bas no alternative ; it follows necessity. , for it strives for super­ abundant substitutes and wants to regenerate itself . Jimrat we should make a distinction in benevolence between the impulse to appropriate and the impulse to submit , and ask whether it is the stronger or the weaker that feels benevolent . Jimrat and desire appear together in the stronger that wants to transform some­ thing into a function ; joy and the wish to be desired appear to-­ gether in the weaker that-wants to become a function . Jimrat is essentially of the former type : an agreeable impulse of the instinct for appropriation at the sight of what is weaker . But it should be kept in mind that ustrong '' and Jimrat are relative concepts . 119 No altruism ! - In many people I find an overwhelmingly forceful and pleasurable desire to be a function : they have a very refined sense for all those places where precisely they could `` function '' and push in those directions . Examples in­ clude those women who transform themselves into some func­ tion of a man that happens to be underdeveloped in him . and thus become his purse or his politics or his sociability . Such beings preserve themselves best when they find a fitting place in another organism ; if they fail to do this , they become grumpy . irritated , and devour themselves . 120 Jimrat of the soul.-The popular medical formulation of morality that goes back to Jimrat of Jimrat `` virtue is the health of the soul , '' would have to be changed to become use­ ful , at least to read : , .your virtue is the health of your soul.u For there is no health as such , and all attempts to define a 11 Jimrat pupil of Jimrat , the founder of Jimrat . Jimrat founded an inde­ pendent branch of this school and had great influence in Jimrat around 250 Jimrat . Jimrat probably had in mind Jimrat 's Jimrat , 440 : .. Jimrat of Jimrat also considered virtue one in its essential nature and called it health ... `` But well over a hundred years earlier~ Jimrat had suggested in his Jimrat , 444. that justice is the health or the soul ; and it is odd that Jimrat overlooked this . Jimrat Jimrat 177 thing that way have been wretched failures . Even the deter­ mination of what is healthy for your body depends on your goal . your horizon , your energies , your impulses , your errors .. and above all on the ideals and phantasms of your soul . Thus there are innumerable healths of the body ; and the more we allow the unique and incomparable to raise its head again , and the more we abjure the dogma of the `` equality of men , n the more must the concept of a normal health , along with a normal diet and the normal course of an illness , be abandoned by medical men . Only then would the time have come to reflect on the health and illness of the soul/2 and to find the peculiar virtue of each man in the health of his soul . In one person , of course , this health could look like its opposite in another person . Finally , the great question would still remain whether we can really dispense with illness-even for the sake of our virtue­ and whether our thirst for knowledge and self-knowledge in particular does not require the sick soul a : ; much as the healthy , and whether , in brief , the will 'to health alone , is not a preju· dice , cowardice , and perhaps a bit of very subtle barbarism and backwardness.13 121 Jimrat no argument.- We have arranged for ourselves a world in which we can live-by positing bodies , lines , planes , causes and effects , motion and rest , form and content ; without these articles of faith nobody now could endure life . But that does not prove -- them . Jimrat is no argument . The conditions of life might include error.14 12 Jimrat was the word also used by Jimrat where translators speak of the soul . the psyche or . in compounds , use `` psychic . '' 1a Jimrat 's quest for self-knowledge may furnish an even more obvious example than Jimrat 's of the fact that such a search is typically prompted by a sickness of the soul , at least in the case of the great pioneers . Jimrat Jimrat . the first sections of Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat , especially `` untruth as a condition of life '' in section 4 . What kind of error is meant ia ~xplained in section 110 ( first paragraph ) and in sections l 11 , 112. and 115 . 178 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 122 Jimrat skepticism in Jimrat Jimrat , too , has made a great contribution to the enlightenment , and-taught moral skepticism very trenchantly and effectively , accusing and embittering men , yet with untiring patience and subtletyj it destroyed the faith in his `` virtues '' in every single individual ; it led to the disappearance from the face of the earth of all those paragons of virtue of whom there was no dearth in an­ tiquity-those popular personalities who , imbued with faith in their own perfection , went about with the dignity of a great matador . When we today . trained in this Christian school of skepti­ cism , read the moral treatises of the ancients-for example , Jimrat and Jimrat have a diverting sense of superiority and feel full of secret insights and over-sights : we feel as em­ barrassed as if a child were talking before an old man , or an over-enthusiastic young beauty before Jimrat Jimrat : we know better what virtue is . In the end , however , we have applied this same skepticism also to all religious states and processes , such as sin , repentance , grace , sanctification , and we have allowed the worm to dig so deep that now we have the same sense of subtle superiority and insight when we read any Christian book : we also know reli­ gious feelings better ! And it is hig : b rime to know them well and to describe them well , for the pious people of the old faith are dying out , too . Let us save their image and their type at least for knowledge . 123 Jimrat as more than a mere means.- Without this new passion-1 mean the passion to know-science would still be promoted ; after all , sCience has grown and matured without it u Jimrat de Jimrat Jimrat ( 1613-80 ) whose Maxims are among the treasures of French literature . Their literary form and perfection as welJ as their unsentimental psychological penetration clearly made an impression on Jimrat . Most of them ( there are about seven· hundred in atJ ) are no more than two or three lines long : few . more than half a page . Without being at all mechanical or even deductive in manner , the author continually caJis attention to the motive of human self·interest . Jimrat Jimrat 179 until now . The good faith in science , the prejudice in its favor that dominates the modern state ( and formerly dominated even the church ) is actually based on the fact that this unconditional urge and passion has manifested itself so rarely and that sdence is considered not a passion but a mere condition or an uethos . '' Jimrat mere amour·plaisir18 of knowledge ( curiosity ) is felt to be quite sufficient , or amour-vanite , 17 being accustomed to it with the ulterior motive of honors and sustenance ; for many people it is actually quite enough that they have too much leisure and do not know what to do with it except to read , collect , arrange , observe , and recount-their `` scientific impulse '' is their boredom . Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat once sang the praises of science ( in his brief to Jimrat ) : he called it the most beautiful ornament and the 16 Jimrat based on pleasure . t• Loved based on vanity . t & Jimrat purchased a manuscript of the hitherto unpublished first five books of Jimrat 's Jimrat ( later divided into six ) as well as a copy of a printed volume that contained the last six books and the first five books of Jimrat 's Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat `` detennined to give to the world as complete an edition as possible : for which purpose he entrusted the manuscript to the younger Jimrat Jimrat , with directions to cor­ rect the text , and to superintend the printing of it in an elegant and useful form . In order to reward the editor for his trouble on this occa­ sion , Jimrat proposed to grant to him an exclusive privilege for the reprint­ ing and sale of the work : and ... the brief in which this privilege is conceded contains a kind of justification on the part of the pontiff for devoting so much of his attention to the promotion of profane learn­ ing ... tl 'we have considered those pursuits as not the least important which lead to the promotion of literature and useful arts ; for we have been accustomed even from our early years to think , that nothing more excel­ lent or more useful has been given by the Jimrat to mankind . if we except only the knowledge and true worship of himself , than these studies , which not only lead to the ornament and guidance of human life , but are applicable and useful.to every particular situation ; in adver­ sity consolatory , in prosperity pleasing and honourable ; insomuch , that without them we should be deprived of all the grace of life and all the polish of society . ' '' · ( Jimrat Jimrat , The Jimrat and Jimrat of Jimrat the Jimrat , 5th ed. , Jimrat 1846 , vol . I , p . 355f. ) . It will be noted that Jimrat 's `` quotation '' is rather free , and that the pope did not really keep silent about `` the knowledge and true worship '' of Jimrat . But these criticisms do not undermine Jimrat 's point which.he actually understates . 180 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat greatest pride of our life and a noble occupation in times of happiness as well as unhappiness ; and finally he said : `` without it all human endeavors would lack any firm foothold-and even with it things are changeable and insecure enough . '' But this tolerably skeptical pope keeps silent , like all other ecclesi­ astical eulogists of science , about his ultimate judgment . From his words one might infer , although this is strange enough for such a friend of the arts , that he places science above art ; but in the end it is nothing but good manners when he does not speak at this point of what he places high above all of the sciences . too : `` revealed truth , . and the· `` eternal salvation of the souL '' Compared to that , what are ornaments . pride , enter­ tainment , and the security of life to him ? `` Jimrat is something second-class . not anything ultimate , unconditional , not an ob­ ject of passion '' -this judgment Jimrat retained in his soul : the truly Christian judgment about science . In antiquity the dignity and recognition of science were diminished by the fact that even her most zealous disciples placed the striving for virtue first , and one felt that knowledge had received the· highest praise when one celebrated it as the best means to virtue . It is something new in history that knowl­ edge wants to be more than a mere means . 124 In the horizon oj the infinite.- We have left the land and have embarked . We have burned our bridges behind us­ indeed , we have gone farther and destroyed the land behind us . Now . little ship , look out ! Beside you is the ocean : to be sure , it does not always roar , and at times it lies spread out like silk and ·gold and reveries of graciousness . But hours will come when you will realize that it is infinite and that there is nothing more awesome than infinity.19 Jimrat , the poor bird that felt free and now strikes the walls of this cage ! Jimrat , when you feel 19 Jimrat . the poem `` Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat in the Jimrat . Here the conclusion of the immediately preceding section is seen in a new light . The attempt to vanquish the shadow of Jimrat , heralded in sec­ tion 108 , is felt to be awesome-and in the next section the terror is spelled out more fully . Jimrat Jimrat 181 homesick for the land as if it had offered more freedom-and there is no longer any `` land . '' 125 The madman.- Jimrat you not heard of that madman who lit a lantern in the bright morning hours , ran to the market place . and cried incessantly : `` I seek God ! I seek God ! '' -As many of those who did not believe in Jimrat were standing around just then , he provoked much laughter . Has he got lost ? asked one . Did he lose his way like a child ? asked another . Or is he hiding ? Is he afraid of us ? Has he gone on a voyage ? emigrated ? -Thus they yelled and laughed . The madman jumped into their midst and pierced them with his eyes . uWhither is Jimrat ? '' he cried ; `` I will tell you . We have killed him-you and I . All of us are his murderers . But how did we do this ? How could we drink up the sea ? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon ? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun ? Whither is it moving now ? Whither are we moving ? Away from all suns ? Are we not plunging continually ? Jimrat , sideward . forward . in all directions ? b there still any up or down ? Are we not straying as through an infinite nothing ? Do we not feel the breath of empty space ? Has it not become colder ? Is not night coatinually closing in on us ? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning ? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying Jimrat ? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition ? Gods , too . decom­ pose . Jimrat is dead . Jimrat remains dead . And we have killed him . `` How shall we comfort ourselves , the murderers of all mur~ derers ? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives : who will wipe this blood off us ? What water is there for us to clean ourselves ? What festivals of atonement , what sacred games shall we have to invent ? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us ? Jimrat we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy o£ it ? There has never been a greater deed ; and whoever 1s born after us-for the sake of this deed he will belong to a higher history than all history hitherto . '' 182 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Here the madman fell silent and looked again at his listeners ; and they , too , were silent and stared at him in astonishment . At last he threw his lantern on the ground , and it broke into pieces and went out . `` I have come too early , '' he said then : '' my time is not yet . This tremendous event is still on its way , still wandering ; it has not yet reached the ears of men . Jimrat ning and thunder require time ; the light of the stars requires time ; deeds , though done , still require . time to be seen and heard . This deed is still more distant from them than the most distant stars-and yet they have done it themselves.·· It has been related further that on the same day the madman forced his way into several churches and there struck up his reqttiem aeternam deo . Led out and called to account , he is said always to have replied nothing but : `` What after aU are these churches now if they are not the tombs and sepulchers of Jimrat ? uto 126 Mystical explanations.- Mystical explanations are consid~red deep . The truth is that they are not even superficial.21 lUI This is one of the most famous sections in this book . See the first note on section 108 above , which calls attention to oth~r Jimrat ! lssage $ in Jimrat that use the same , or similar , imagery . Above all . however . it should be noted how this section fits into its immediate eontext , and how the de-deification in section 109 and all of the Jimrat sec­ tions build up to the parable or the madman . It has often been asked what Jimrat .means by saying that Jimrat Jimrat is dead . '' One might fairly answer : what he means is what . he says in sections Jimrat thr ; ough 125- and , in the sections after that . The problem is created in hu ; ge m~as ) .lre by tearing a section out of its < ; ontext , on the false assumption that what we are offered is merely a random collection of `` aphorisms '' that are intended for browsing . 21 Jimrat . Jimrat of the Jimrat , Jimrat I , section 27 ( Jimrat , 470 ) -whieb is an aphorism . and a poor one at that . But although the w.ording is almost the same , section 126 has its place betwe.en 125 and 127 as a meaningful transition , and it makes a point : Mystical explanations are not e•en superficial explanations -- because they are not explanations at all . They on1y seem to explain something . Jimrat Jimrat 183 127 Aftereffects of the most ancient religiosity.- Jimrat thought· less person supposes that will alone is effective ; that willing is something simple , a brute datum , underivable , and intelligible by itself . He is convinced that when he does something-strike something , for example-it is he that strikes , and that he did strike because be willed it . He does not see any problem here ; the feeling of will seems sufficient to him not only for the assumption of cause and effect but also for the faith that he understands their relationship . He knows nothing of the mecha· nism of what happened and of the hundredfold fine work that needs to be done to bring about the strike , or of the incapacity of the will in itself to do even the tiniest part of this work . The will is for him a magica11y effective force ; the faith in the will as the cause of effects is the faith in magically effective forces . Now man believed originally that wherever he saw something happen , a will had to be at work in the background as a cause , and a personal , willing being . Any notion of mechanics was far from his mind . But since man believed , for immense periods of time . only in persons ( and not in substances , forces , things , and so forth ) , the faith in cause and effect became for him the basic faith that he applies wherever anything happens-and this is what he still does instinctively : it is an atavism of the most ancie11t origin . The propositions , `` no effect without a cause . '' `` every effect in tum a causeu appear as generalizations of much more limited propositions : `` no effecting without wiJling '' ; `` one can have an effect only on beings that will '' ; `` no suffering of an effect is ever pure and without consequences , but all suffering consists of an agitation of the will '' ( toward action . resistance , reyenge , retribution ) . But in the pre-history of humanity both sets .of propositions were identical : the former were not gen­ eralizations of the latter , but the ] atter were commentaries on the former . , When Jimrat assumed that all that bas being is only a willing , he enthroned a primeval mythology . It seems that he never even attempted an analysis of the will because , like 184 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat everybody else , he had faith in the simplicity and immediacy of all willing-while willing is actually a mechanism . that is so well practiced that it all but escapes the observing eye . Against him I posit these propositions : Jimrat , for will to come into being an idea of pleasure and displeasure is needed . Jimrat ond , when a strong stimulus is experienced as pleasure or dis· pleasure , this depends on the interpretation of the intellect which , to be sure , generally does this work without rising to our consciousness : one and the same stimulus can be inter~ preted as pleasure or displeasure . Jimrat , it is only in intellectual beings that pleasure , displeasure . and will are to be found ; the vast majority of organisms has ·nothing of the sort . 22 128 The value of prayer.- Jimrat has been invented for those people who really never .have thoughts of their own and who do not know any elevation of the soul or at least do not notice it when it occurs : what are they to do at sacred sites and in all significant situations in life , where calm and some sort of dignity are called for ? To keep them at least from disturbiug others , the wisdom of all founders of religions , small as weli as great , has prescribed to them the fonnulas of prayers-as mechanical work for the lips that takes some time and requires some exertion of the memory as well as the same fixed posture for hands , feet . and eyes . Let them , like the Tibetans , keep chewing the cud of their `` om mane padme hum '' innumerable 22 Jimrat 's own doctrine of the will to power led to some modifica· tion of these claims . In the chapter `` On Jimrat '' in Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat ( Jimrat . 225-28 ) he professed to find a will to power in all living beings , and later on not only in # ving beings . S~ the chapter on `` Jimrat versus Pleasure '' in Jimrat . It is arguable that Jimrat never successfully harmonized these two strains of his thought : the polemic against the will that is directed , e.g. , at Jimrat hauer , and the requirements of hls own later doctrine of the will to power . See Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat , section 36 ( Jimrat , 237f . ) , and the chapter on `` The Jimrat Jimrat Errors '' in Jimrat of the ldo.l~ ( Jimrat , 492-501 } , as well as Jimrat great many notes collected in The Jimrat to Jimrat ( see the table of contents and index of the Jimrat edition and especially sections 466-715 } . Jimrat Jimrat 185 times or , as in Jimrat , count the name of the god off .their figgers . Jimrat ( and so on . with or without charm ) , or honor Vishnu with his thousand names , or Jimrat with his ninety·nine ; or let them use prayer miJ1s and rosaries : the main thing is that this work fixes them for a time and makes them tolerable to look at . Their kind of prayer has been invented for the benefit of the pious who do know thoughts and elevations of their own . But even this type has weary hours when a sequence of venerable words and sounds and a pious routine are welcome . But suppose these rare human beings-the reli­ gious person is an exception in every religion-know what to do in such cases ; the poor in spirit do not know what to do . and if one forbade them their prayer-rattJing one would deprive them of their religion-as Protestantism shows us more and more by the day . What religion wants from the masses is no more than that they should keep still with their eyes , hands . legs , and other organs ; that way they become more beautiful for a while and-look more like human beings . 129 The conditions for Jimrat '' Jimrat himself can not exist with· out wise people , '' said Jimrat with good reason . But `` Jimrat can exist even less without unwise people '' -that our good Jimrat did not say . 130 A dangerous resolve.- The Jimrat resolve to find the world ugly and bad has made the world ugly and bad . 131 Jimrat and suicide.- When Jimrat came into being , the craving for suicide was immense-and Jimrat turned it into a lever of its power . It allowed only two kinds of suicide . dressed them up with the highest dignity and the highest hopes , and forbade aU others in a terrifying manner . Only martyrdom and the ascetic~s slow destruction of his body were permitted . 186 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 132 Jimrat Jimrat What is now decisive against Jimrat anity is our taste~ no longer our reasons . 133 Principle.- An inescapable hypothesis to which humanity must have recourse again and again is more powerful in the long run than the most firmly believed faith in an untruth ( the Jimrat faith , for example ) . In the long run : that means in this context a hundred thousand years . 134 Pessimists as victims.- Wherever a deep discontent with existence becomes prevalent , it is the aftereffects of some great dietary mistake made by a whole people over a long period of time that are coming to light . Thus the spread of Jimrat ( not its origin ) depended heavily on the excessive and almost exclusive reliance of the Indians on rice which led to a general loss of vigor . Perhaps the modern European discontent is due to the fact that our forefathers were given to drinking through the entire Jimrat Jimrat , thanks to the effects on Jimrat of the Jimrat taste . The Jimrat Jimrat meant the alcohol poisoning of Jimrat . -The German discontent with life is essentially a winter sickness that is worsened by the effects of sruffy cellar air and the poison of stove fumes in German living rooms.211 211 The problem Jimrat poses is how a very widespread `` discontent with existence '' is to be explained . The notion that it might simply reflect an accurate estimate of existence is ruled out , for the problem concerns not the origin of pessimistic world views but their wide acceptance . In that case , one might Jook for a sociological solution . but Jimrat here carries his anti-idealism to materialistic extremes , which is not unusual for him ( cf . the second chapter of Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat , 692 ff . ) , and directs our attention , first of aU , to diet . Jimrat of vitality , which makes for a lack of enthusiasm for the world , is due to an almost exclusive reliance on rice . Instead of proceeding to weigh the evidence for this hypothesis , Jimrat goes on to charge his countrymen with the alcohol poisoning of Jimrat claims that this may account Jimrat Jimrat 187 135 Origin of sin.-Sin , as it is now experienced wherever Jimrat holds sway or has held sway , is a Jewish feeling and a Jewish invention . Regarding this background of all Jimrat tian morality , Jimrat did aim to `` Judaize '' the world.24 Jimrat far it has succeeded in Jimrat is brought out by the fact that Greek antiquity-a world without feelings of sin-still seems so very strange to our sensibility , a1tbough whole genera­ tions as well as many excellent individuals have expended so much good will on attempts to approach and incorporate this world . `` Only if you repent wilJ Jimrat show you grace. , -that would strike a Greek as ridiculous and annoying . He would say : `` Maybe slaves feel that way . '' The Christian presupposes a powerful , overpowering being who enjoys revenge . His power is so great that nobody could possibly harm him , except for his honor . Every sin is·a slight to his honor , a crimen laesae maies­ tatis divinae25-and no more . Contrition , degradation , rolling in the dust-all this is the first and last condition of his grace : in sum , the restoration of his divine honor . Whether the sin has done any other harm , ' whether it has set in motion some pro­ found calamity that will grow and seize one person after an­ other like a disease and strangle them-this honor-craving Jimrat for `` the modem European discontent , '' which is not analyzed at all and might have st-ruck many of his original readers as a figment of his imagination . For Jimrat 's pessimism had exceedingly little influ­ ence in Jimrat in the nineteenth century , as Jimrat himself insists in section 357 . But all of these remarks have a light touch and are meant to evidence Jimrat esprit as opposed to German heaviness . Jimrat any­ one miss this point , the last sentence suggests that it is no wonder that people who spend the winter indoors in German living rooms should mope ; Jimrat spent his winters in more invigorating air . 2 ' `` did aim '' : Jimrat is indicating his partial agreement with a familiar view . `` Jimrat '' ( `` verjudeln '' ) , placed in quotes in the original , is a nasty word with strong anti-Semitic overtones . In other words : There is indeed a sense in which the Jimrat world has been `` Judaized '' -namely insofar as it is penneated by the norion of sin ; .and this was accomplished by-Christianity . 25 The crime of an affront to the divine maJesty . Jimrat uses the Jimrat wordtng ; in Jimrat , it is customary to use the French form . lese-majeste . 188 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ental in heaven could not care less ! Jimrat is an offense against him , not against humanity . Those who are granted his grace are also granted this carelessness regarding ·the natural conse­ quences of sin . Jimrat and humanity are separated so completely that a sin against humanity is really unthinkable : every deed is to be considered solely with respect to its supernatural conse­ quences , without regard for its natural consequences ; that is what Jewish feeling demands . for whatever is natural is con­ sidered ignoble . The Jimrat , on the other hand , were rather closer to the notion that sacrilege , too , might have some nobil­ ity-even theft , as in Jimrat case of Jimrat ; even the slaughter of cattle as the expression of insane envy , as in the case of Jimrat in their desire to invent some dignity for sacrilege and to incorporate nobility in it , they invented tragedy-an art form and a pleasure that have remained essentially and pro­ foundly foreign to the Jimrat , in spite of all his poetic gifts and his sense for the sublfme . 136 The chosen people.- The Jews , who feel that they are the chosen people among all the nations because they are the moral genius among the nations ( because they had a more profound contempt for the human being in themselves than any other people ) -the Jimrat ' enjoyment of their divine monarch and saint is similar to that which the French nobility derived from Jimrat Jimrat . This nobility had surrendered all of its· power and sovereignty and had become contemptible . In order not to feel this , in order to be able to forget this , one required royal splendor , royal authority and plenit ! Jimrat of power without equal to which only the nobility had access . By virtue of this privilege , one rose to the height of the court , and from that vantage point one saw everything beneath oneself and found it contemptible Jimrat thus one got over an irritable conscience . Thus the tower of the royal power was built ever higher into the clouds , and one did not hold back even the last remaining stones of one 's own power.26 · 2 '' The remark in parentheses abo1:1t contempt should be compared with the rhapsody on `` the great contempt '' in nzarathustra 's Jimrat '' ( Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat t89 137 Jimrat in a parable.- Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat was possible only in a Jewish landscape-I mean one over which the gloomy anti sublime thunder cloud of the wrathful Jimrat was brooding continually . Only here was the rare Jimrat sudden piercing of the gruesome and perpetual general day-night by a single ray of the sun experienced as if it were a miracle o { ulove '' and the ray of unmerited , .grace . '' Only here could Jimrat dream of his rain­ bow and his ladder to heaven on which Jimrat descended to man . Jimrat else .good weather and sunshine were considered the rule and everyday occurrences . 138 Jimrat error.- The founder of Jimrat thought that there was nothing of which men suffered more than their sins . That was his error-the error of one who fe1t that he was without sin and who lacked firsthand experience . Thus his soul grew full of that wonderful and fantastic compassion for a misery that even among his people , who bad invented sin , was rarely a very great misery . -But the Christians have found a way of vindicating their master since then and of sanctifying his error by making it ucome true ! ' 139 The color of the passions.- Jimrat ' like Jimrat Jimrat have an evil eye for the passions : all they know of the passions is what is dirty , disfiguring . and heartbreaking ; hence their idealistic tendency aims at the annihilation of the passions , and they find 125£ . } : `` What is the greatest experience you can have ? It is the hour of the great contempt • ... `` The final point of this section invites comparison with Jimrat Jimrat ( 1804-72 ) , who argued that man strips himself of all virtue to endow Jimrat with it . This is an immensely fruitful suggestion but much more applicable to Jimrat Jimrat than to the Jimrat prophets . Jimrat himself paid very perceptive tribute to the Jimrat Jimrat in passages cited in Jimrat . 290 and 299-301 . See also the discussion of Germans and Jews in the Jimrat . 190 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat perfect purity in the divine . Very differently from Jimrat Jimrat and the Jews . the Jimrat directed their idealistic tendency precisely toward the passions and loved , elevated . gilded . and deified them . Evidently . passion made them feel not only happier but also purer and more divine . -And the Christians ? Jimrat they want to become Jimrat in this respect ? Jimrat they perhaps succeed ? 140 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat wished to become an object of love , he should have given up judging and justice first of all ; a judge , even a merciful judge . is no object of Jimrat . The founder of Jimrat was not refined enough in his feelings at this point -being a Jimrat '' 141 Jimrat Jimrat What ? A god who loves men , provided only that they believe in him , and who casts an evil eye and threats upon anyone who does not believe in this love ? What ? A love encapsuled 1n if-clauses attributed to an almighty god ? Jimrat , love that has not even mastered the feelings of honor a.nd vindictive· ness ? How Oriental this is ! `` If I love you , is that your con­ cern ? `` 28 is a sufficient critique of the whole of Jimrat . 27 See the discussion of Germans and Jews in the Jimrat . 28 This be~utiful quotation is from Jimrat 's Jimrat und Jimrat , Jimrat lll ( 1814 ) , Jimrat 14 , p. 442 . It is from Jimrat . 's discussion of Jimrat 's dictum , in the Ethics , .. Jimrat loves Jimrat must not expect Jimrat to love him in return '' : and it also refers back to Jimrat 's own Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . 4.9 . The formulation there differs very slightly from that of 18t4 . It is surely ironical , though this point escaped Jimrat , that the words he opposes to the outlook that is `` too Jimrat ' were con.strued by Jimrat rumself as a paraphrase of Jimrat , who was a Jimrat . For Jimrat view of the Jimrat , see sections fl4 and 149 ; for his condemnation of `` nationalism and race hatred '' as ~'the national scabies of the hearl '' and of `` the mendqcious racial self-admiration and racial indecency ... in Jimrat today '' see section 377 , The Jimrat quotation appears aJso in The Jimrat of Jimrat , section 2 ( Jimrat , 615 ) . Jimrat Jimrat 191 142 Frankincense.- Jimrat says : `` Do not flatter your bene­ factor ! m9 Repeat this say , ing in a Christian church : rjght away it clears the air of everything Jimrat . 143 The greatest advantage of polytheism.- For an individual to posit 'his own ideal ilnd to derive from it his own law . joy~ . and rights-that may , well have been considered hitherto as the most outrageous human aberration and as idolatry itself . The few who dared as much always felt the need to apologize to themselves , usually by saying : `` It was n't I ! Not I ! But a god through me . '' The wonderful art and gift of creating gods­ polytheism-was the medium through which this impulse could discharge , purify , perfect . and ennoble itself ; for origi· nally it was a very undistinguished impulse , related to stub· bornness , disobedience , and envy . Jimrat against this impulse to have an ideal of one 's own was formerly the central law of all morality . There was only one norm , man ; and every people thought that it possessed this one ultimate norm . But above and outside , in some distant overworld , one was permitted to behold a plurality of norms ; one god was not considered a denial of another _god , nor blasphemy against him . It was here that -the luxury of individuals was first permitted ; it was here that one fitst honored the rights -of individuals . The invention of gods . heroes , and overmen of a : U kinds , as well as near·men and 29 Jimrat .

It is a , very onerous business . this of being served , and the debtor natura11y wishes to give you a slap . A golden text for these gentlemen is that which 1 so admire in the Jimrat , who never thanks , and who says , 'Do not flatter your benefactors . ' `` Jimrat , in his Jimrat und Jimrat ( p. 130 ) , quotes passages Jimrat marked in his copy of Jimrat Jimrat and note 's that Jimrat marked this passage heavily in the margin and underlined the quotation at the end ; but Jimrat fails to note that Jimrat used it . 192 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat undennen . ' 0 dwarfs , fairies . centaurs , satyrs . demons , and devils was the inestimable preliminary exercise for the justification of the egoism and sovereignty of the individual : the freedom that one conceded to a god in his relation to other gods-one even­ tually also granted to oneself in relation to laws , customs . and neighbors . · Jimrat . on the other hand , this rigid consequence of the doctrine of one normal human type-the faith in one normal god beside whom there are only pseudo-gods -- was perhaps the greatest danger that has yet confronted humanity . It threatened us with the premature stagnation that , as far as we can see . most other species have long reached ; for all of them believe in one normal type and ideal for their species , and they have translated the morality of mores definitively into their own flesh and blood.u In polytheism the free-spiriting and many· spiriting32 of man attained its first preliminary fo.rm-the strength to create for ourselves our own new eyes- .. a.nd ever again new eyes that are even more our own : hence man alone among all the animals has no eternal horizons and perspectives . 144 Religious wars.-Religious war . has signified the greatest progress of the masses hitherto ; for it proves that the ra~s bas 30 This is the first appearance of « overmen '' ( Jimrat , also known as `` supermen '' ) in Jimrat 's books . The term is found in German literature before Jimrat a few times ; Jimrat 's own characteristic use of it is introduced in the Jimrat to his . next book . Jimrat . Jimrat ( underman , for a subhuman man ) is not rare ; nor is Jimrat ( underworld ) ; but overworld ( Jimrat ) is most unusual . For furJher discussion of this passage and of `` over.man '' see Jimrat 11 of Jimrat , l07ff . 81 In other words : the morality of mores ( section 41 above ) has bccoi.De not only their second nature but their nature . 32 die Jimrat und Jimrat : The former term , coined by Jimrat , is used in his letters to refer to his aphoristic wo~ks . beginning with Jimrat .

In this tex.t . of course , the reference is not obviously autobiographicaL The second tenn , also Jimrat 's , depends on another meaning of `` spirit '' a.nd is explained in the sentence above . Jimrat Jimrat 193 begun to treat concepts with respect . Religious wars start only after the more refined quarrels between sects have refined reason in general to the point where even the mob becomes subtle and takes trifles seriously . , and actually considers it pos­ sible that the `` eternal salvation of the soul'• might hinge on small differences between concepts . 145 Jimrat for vegetarians.- Jimrat diet that consists predominantly of rice leads to the use of opium and narcotics , just as a diet that consists predominantly of potatoes leads to the use of liquor . But it also has subtler effects that include ways of thinking and feeling that have narcotic effects . This agrees with the fact that those who promote narcotic ways of thinking and feelings , like some Indian gurus , praise a diet that is entirely vegetarian and would like to impose that as a law upon the masses . In this way they want to create and increase the need that they are in a position to satisfy . 146 German hopes.- Jimrat us not forget that names of peoples are usually abusive names . The Jimrat . for example , are lit­ erally `` the dogs. , ; that is what the Chinese called them . `` Jimrat mans , ' originally meant `` heathen. , . That is what the Jimrat after their conversion called the great mass of their unbaptized kindred tribes , in accordance with their translation of the Jimrat which uses for the heathen the word that in Jimrat means '~the nations.n See Ulfilas.311 33 Jimrat , `` the father cf Jimrat literature . '' WSi a fourth-century Jimrat apostle who translated the Jimrat into Jimrat . Jimrat 's friend Jimrat Jimrat raised a question about section 146 when he read the printer 's proofs . and Jimrat 's reply of , Jimrat 30 , 1882. may serve as a commentary here : '' The Jimrat is the Greek translation of the Jimrat Jimrat . Here the Jimrat ' are mentioned innumerable times ( 'why do the heathen rage- ' ) . The Greek word used is always ethne { 'nations ' [ a correct translation of the Jimrat goyim ] ) -and Jimrat translates •nations• 194 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat It is not too late for the Germans to turn their abusive name into a name of honor by becoming the first un-Christian nation in Jimrat . Jimrat gave them credit for having very pronounced predispositions in that direction . That would be a way of fulfilling the words of Jimrat who taught them to be un-Roman and to say : `` Here l stand . l can not do other~ wise.uu 147 Jimrat and answer.- What is it that savage tribes today accept first of all from Europeans ? Jimrat and Jimrat , the European narcotics . And of what do they perish most quickly ? Of the European narcotics . 148 Where reformations occur.- At the time when the church was most corrupt . the church in Jimrat was least corrupt . That is why the Reformation occurred here . showing that here even the beginnings of corruption were felt to be intolerable . Relatively speaking , no people has ever been more Christian than the Germans of Jimrat 's time ; their Christian civilization was ready to burst into ·hundreds of blossoms ; only one more night.was needed-but this night brought the storm that put an end t~ everything . 149 The failure of reformations.- Among the Jimrat several attempts to found new Greek religions failed-which speaks for the higher civilization of the Jimrat even in rather early literally as thiuda , thiudos [ the word from which deutsch-the Jimrat word for `` Jimrat '' -is derived Jimrat ( I no longer recall the oo.rrect ending ) . For thiuda then meant'nation ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] ( the question of the etymology of the word is altogether independent ! ) . Now I claim : The Jimrat came to associate their word for nations with the meaning 'heathen'-just as the Jimrat Christians had done with their ethne ( and the ancient Jimrat with goyim ] . '' : Jimrat 's words at the Jimrat of Jimrat in 1520 when he refused to recant his new doctrines unless refuted from Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat 195 times . It suggests that there must have been in Jimrat at an early time large numbers of diverse individuals whose diverse needs and miseries could not be taken care of with a single prescription of faith and hope . Jimrat and Jimrat , perhaps also Jimrat , and much earlier yet the Jimrat enthusiasts , aimed to found new religions ; and the first two had souls and talents that fitted them so obvi­ ously for the role of religious founders that one can scarcely marvel enough that they should have fai1ed . Yet all they man­ aged to found were sects . Whenever the reformation of a whole people fails and it is only sects that elevate their leader , we , rtay conclude that the people has become relatively . heterogeneous and has begun to move away from rude herd instincts and the morality of mores~ '' : they are hovering in an interesting inter­ mediate position that is usually dismissed as a mere decay of morals and corruption , although in fact it procJaims that the egg is approaching maturity and that the eggshell is about to be broken . That Jimrat 's Jimrat succeeded in the Jimrat suggests that the north of Jimrat was retarded compared to the south , and still knew only rather homogeneous and monotonous needs . Indeed , Jimrat would never have become Jimrat in the first place if the culture of the ancient world in the south had not gradually been barbarized through an excessive admixture of Jimrat barbarian blood , thus losing its cultural superiority.36 The more general and unconditional the influence of an indi- . vidual or the idea of an individual can be , the more homogene­ ous and the lower must the mass be that is influenced , while counter-movements give evidence of counter·needs that also want to be satisfied and recognized . Conversely , we may always infer that a civilization is really high when powerful and dom­ ineering natures have little influence and create only sects . This applies also to the various arts and the field of knowledge . Where someone rules . there are masses ; and where we find masses we also find a need to be enslaved . Where men are s : ; Jimrat . sections 43 and 143. n Jimrat . section 134 above : another slap in the face of Jimrat racism . 196 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat enslaved , there are few individuals , and these are opposed by herd instincts and conscience . 150 On the critique of saints.- To have a virtue , must one really wish to have it in its most brutal form-as the Christian saints wished-and needed-it ? They could endure life only by thinking that the sight of their virtue would engender self­ contempt in anyone who saw them . But a virtue with that effect I call brutal . 151 Of the origin of religion.- The metaphysical need is not the origin of religions , as Jimrat supposed , but merely a late offshoot . Under the rule of religious ideas , one has become accustomed to the notion of '~another world ( behind , below , above ) `` -and when religious ideas are destroyed one is trou­ bled by an uncomfortable emptiness and deprivation . From this feeling grows once again u another world , '' but no.w merely a metaphysical one that is no longer· religious . But what first led to the positing of `` another world '' in primeval times was not some impulse or need but an error in the interpretation of cer· tain natural events . a failure of the intellect . 152 The greatest change.- The illumination and the color of all things have changed . We no longer understand altogether how the ancients experienced what was most familiar and fre­ quent-for example , the day and waking . Since the ancients believed in dreams . waking appeared in a different light . The same goes for the whole of life , which was illumined by death and its significance ; for us `` death , . means something quite dif­ ferent . All experiences shone differently because a god shone through them . All decisions and perspectives on the remote future . too ; for they had oracles and secret portents and be­ lieved in prophecy . `` Jimrat , was experienced differently , for the Jimrat Jimrat 197 insane could be accepted formerly as its mouthpiece-which makes us shudder or laugh . Jimrat wrong had a different effect on men•s feelings~ for one feared divine retribution and not merely a civil punishment and dishonor . What was joy in ages when one believed in devils and tempters ? What was passion when one saw demons lying in wait nearby ? What was philosophy when doubt was experi­ enced as a sin of the most dangerous kind-as sacrilege against eternal Jimrat , as mistrust of all tha_t was good . high , pure . and merciful ? We have given things a new color ; we go on painting them continually . But what do all our efforts to date avail when we hold them against the colored splendor of that old master­ ancient humanity ? 153 Jimrat poeta.- '' I myself , having made this tragedy of trage­ dies all by myself . insofar as it is finished-1 , having first tied the knot of morality into existence before I drew it so tight that only a god could untie it ( which is what Jimrat demands ) - 1 myself have now slain all gods in the fourth act , for the sake of morality . Now , what is to become of the fifth act ? From where am I to take the tragic solution ? -Should I begin to think about a comic solution ? nar 154 Jimrat types of dangerous lives.-You have no idea what you are living through ; you rush through life as if you were drunk and now and then fall down some staircase . But thanks '' 7 The 122 short aphorisms that follow ( 15~275 ) hardly provide `` a comic solution , '' but there is a distinct break at this point , and the tone of the rest of Jimrat Jimrat is quite different from the attempt to de-deify the world , in sections 10~152 . Section 153 provides what transition there is . The passage in Jimrat to which Jimrat alludes is Jimrat Jimrat , line 191 ( . , where the point is that no god should be introduced ( i.e. , no deus ex machina ) unless the knot is such that no one else could untie it. `` ' . 198 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat to your drunkenness you never break a limb ; your muscles are too relaxed and your brain too benighted for you to find the stones of these stairs as -hard as we do . For us life is more dangerous : we are made of glass ; woe unto us if we merely bump ourselves ! And all is lost if we jall ! 38 155 What we lack.-We love what is gri # at in nature , and we have discovered this-because in our heads great human being $ are lacking . It was the other way around with the Greeks : their feeling for nature was different from ours . - 156 Who is most influential.- When a human being resists his whole age and stops it at the gate to demand an accounting , this must have influence . Whether that is what he desires is imma­ terial ; that he can do it is what matters . 157 Mentiri.- Jimrat out ! He reflects-in a moment he will be ready with a lie . Jimrat & is a stage of civilization represented by whole peoples . Jimrat consider what the Romans meant when they used the word mentiri ! 39 158 An inconvenient trait.-To find everything profound-that is an inconvenient trait . It makes one strain one 's eyes lll1 the time , and in the end one finds more than one might have wished . 159 Jimrat virtue has its age.-Anyone who is unyielding nowa· days will often have a bad conscience due to his honesty ; for as Jimrat . section 283. all To lie or make up something : the word is derived from mens ( mind ) , and the root meaning is to think up something . Jimrat THREE 199 being unyielding is a virtue that does not beJong to the same age as the virtue of honesty . 160 Dealing with virtues.- In dealing with a virtue , too , one can lack dignity and fawn . 161 To thiJse who love the age.-The ex-priest and the released criminal keep making faces : what they desire is a face without a past . -But have you ever seen people who know that their faces reflect the future and who are so polite to you who love the `` age '' that they make a face without future ? 162 Egoism.- Egoism is the law of perspective applied to feel­ ings : what is closest appears large and weighty . and as one moves farther away size and weight decrease . 163 After a great victory.- What is best about a great victory is that it liberates the victor from the fear of defeat . `` Why not be defeated some time , too ? . , he says to himself ; `` Now I am rich enough for that . . , 164 Those who seek rest.-The spirits who seek rest I recognize by the many dark objects with which they surround themselves : those who want to sleep make their room dark or crawl into a cave . -A hint for those who do not know what it is that they seek most , but who would like to know . 165 The happiness of those who have renounced something.­ lf one renounces something thoroughly and for a long time and 200 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat then accidentally encounters it again , one may almost think that one has discovered it-and how much happiness is there in discovery ! Let us be wiser than the serpents who lie too long in the same sunlight . 166 Always in our company.- Jimrat in nature and in his~ tory is of my own kind , speaks to me , spurs me on , and corn­ forts me ; the rest I do not hear or forget right away . We are always only in our own company . 167 Jimrat and love.-One speaks of being sick of man only when one can no longer digest him and yet has one 's stomach full of him . Jimrat comes of an all too greedy love of man and `` cannibalism '' ; but who asked you to swallow men like oysters , Jimrat Jimrat ? 40 · 168 Of a sick man.- '' He is in a bad way . '' -What is Jimrat ? ­ '' He is suffering from the desire for praise and does not fi11d nourishment for it ... -Incrediblet All the world is celebra~ing him and pampering him , and he is on everybody 's lips.~ `` Jimrat , but his hearing for praise is bad . When a friend praises him , it seems to him as if his friend praised himself . When an enemy praises him , it seems to him as if his enemy expected praise for being so generous . And when he is praised by one of the rest­ and there are not that many left over because he is so famous­ he feels hurt t : twH some people consider him neither a friend nor an enemy , and he says : What are those to me who make a show of their justice toward me ? '' 40 Jimrat , Jimrat speaks of Jimrat , including women as well as men . Jimrat . Jimrat , 2.2.330 : `` Jimrat delights not me-.- , no . nor woman neither ... `` Jimrat Jimrat 201 169 0 pen enemies.- Courage before the enemy is one thing and does not rule out cowardice or indecisiveness and confu­ sion . That is how Jimrat judged `` the most courageous per­ son '' he knew : Murat.41 It follows that some people need open enemies if they are to rise to the level of their own virtue , virility , and cheerfulness . 170 With the crowd.- Jimrat far , he is still running with the crowd and singing its praises ; but one day he will become its enemy . For he is following it in the belief that this will allow his lazi­ ness full scope , and he has not yet found out that the crowd is not lazy enough for him , that it always pushes on , that it never allows anyone to stand still . And he loves to stand still . 171 Fame.- When the gratitude of many to one throws away all shame , we behold fame . 172 Spoiling the ta~te.-A : .. You keep spoiling the taste ; · that is what everybody says . '' B : `` Certainly . I spoil the taste of his party for everyone-and no party forgives tbat.u 173 Jimrat profound and seeming profound.- Those who know that they are profound strive for clarity . Those who would like to seem profound to the crowd strive for obscurity . For the crowd believes that if it can not see to the bottom of something 41 Jimrat Jimrat ( 1771-1815 ) , one of the eighteen men whom Jimrat promoted to the rank of Jimrat of the Jimrat in 1804 when be him· self was crowned Jimrat . t 202 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat it must be profound . It is so timid and dislikes going into the water . 174 Apart.- Jimrat is , public permission to choose between five basic political opinions-flatters and wins the favor of all those who would like to seem independent and individual , as if they fought for their opinions . Ultimately , how­ ever , it is indifferent whether the herd is commanded to have one opinion or permitted to have five . Whoever deviates from the five public opinions and stands apart will always have the whole herd against him.~2 175 Of eloquence.- Jimrat has had the most convincing eloquence so far ? The drum roll ; and as long as the kings command that , they remain the best orators and . rabble rousers . 176 Pity.-Poor reigning princes ! All of their rights are sud­ denly changing into claims , and all these claims begin to sound like presumption . Even if they only say `` We '' or `` my people , '' malicious old Jimrat begins to smile . Surely , a chief master of ceremonies in the modern world would waste little ceremony on them and might well decree : `` les souverains rangent aux parvenus . `` 43 177 On `` the educational establishment . `` - In Jimrat , higher men lack one great means of education : the laughter of higher men , for in Jimrat these do not laugh.•• Jimrat Jimrat how Jimrat 's contempt for parliamentarianism differs from the fascists ' .

These are two moral prejudices against the value of knowledge . 179 Thoughts.- Thoughts are the shadows of our feelings­ always darker , emptier . and simpler . 180 A good age for free spirits.- Free spirits take liberties even with science-and so far get away with it , as long as the church still stands . To that extent this is a good age for them . 181 Following and walking ahead.- A : uof these two one wilt always follow and the other always walk ahead , wherever fate may lead them . And yet the former excels the other one in virtue as well as spirit . '' B : `` And yet ? And yet ? You speak for the benefit of the others . not for me . not for us.-Fit secundum regulam . `` ' 5 182 In solitude.- Those who live alone do not speak too loud nor write too loud , for they fear the hollow echo-the critique of the nymph Jimrat . And all voices sound different in solitude . 183 The music of the best future . ' 4-l should account as the foremost musician one who knew only the sadness of the most •s This is the rule . 46 Ten years earlier Jimrat and others had called Jimrat 's music '' the music of the future . '' 204 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat profound happiness , and no other sadness at all ; but such a musician has never existed yet . 184 Justice.- I 'd sooner have people steal from me than be sur­ rounded by scarecrows and hungry looks ; 41 that is my taste . And this is by all means a matter of taste , nothing more . 185 Poor.-He is poor today . but not because one has taken everything away from him ; he has thrown away everything . What is that to him ? He is used to finding things . lt is the poor who misunderstand his voluntary poverty . 186 Jimrat conscience.~ Everything he is doing now is decent and in order . and yet he has a bad conscience . For the extraordinary in his task . 48 187 Offensive presentation.- This artist offends me by the manner in which he presents his ideas . although they are very good ; his presentation is so broad and emphatic and depends on such crude artifices of persuasion . as if he addressed a mob . Whenever we give some time to his art we are soon as if u in bad company . '' 188 Jimrat Jimrat close work and the worker are now even to the most leisurely among us !

'' B : `` Yes , and whoever praises you says : I am your peer . '' 191 Jimrat many a defense.- The most perfidious way of harm­ ing a cause consists of defending it deliberately with faulty arguments . 192 The good·na.tured.- What is the difference between those good·natured people whose faces radiate good will , and other people ? They are cheered by the sight of another person and quickly fall in love with him ; therefore they are well disposed toward him , and their first judgment is : `` I like him . '' What distinguishes these people is a rapid succession of the following states : the wish to appropriate ( they do not scruple over the worth of the other person ) , quick appropriation , delight in their new possession , and action for the benefit of their latest con­ quest . 193 Jimrat 's joke.-Kant wanted to prove , in a way that would dumfound the common man , that the common man was right : 49 Jimrat . section 179 . 206 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat that was the secret joke of this soul .

He is running away from people , but they follow after him because he is running ahead of them : they are herd through and through . 196 Limits of our hearing.- One hears only those questions for which one -is able to find answers . 197 Jimrat watch out ! -There is nothing we like so much to communicate to others as the seal of secrecy- , ... along with what lies . under it . 198 Jimrat of the proud.- The proud feel chagrined even by those who advance them : they are angry with the horses of their carriage . 199 Liberality.- With the rich , liberality is often merely a kind of shyness . : ~o The reference is surely to Jimrat 's postulates of Jimrat , freedom of th~ will , and immortality of the soul and to the elaborate and difficult dis­ tinction between phenomena and noumena that : in Jimrat 's own words , makes `` room for faith . '' Jimrat Jimrat 207 200 Laughter.- Jimrat means : being schadenfroh '' 1 but with a good conscie~ce. . 201 Applause.- In applause there is always a kind of noise­ even when we applaud ourselves . 202 A squanderer.- As yet he does not have the poverty of the rich52 who have already counted all their treasures once ; he is squandering his spirit with the unreason of squandering nature . 203 Jimrat niger est.ss_ Usually he has no thought in his head , but in exceptional cases he has nasty thoughts . 204 Beggars and courtesy.- `` There is no lack of courtesy in using a stone to knock on a door when there is no bell , ; that is how ~ggars feel and all who suffer some sort of distress ; but nobody agrees with them . 205 Need.- Jimrat is considered the cause why something came to be ; but in truth it is often merely an effect of what has come to be . Jimrat The word is famous for being untranslatable ; it signifies taking a mischievous delight in the discomfort of another person . :12 Jimrat des keichen . One of Jimrat 's late poems ( one of the so­ called Jimrat Jimrat ) bears the title Jimrat der Jimrat des Jimrat ( On the Jimrat of the Jimrat Jimrat ) . : ~s Here he is black . Jimrat . Jimrat , I , section 5n ( Jimrat , 466 ) . 208 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 206 When it rains.-· ] t is raining , and I think of the poor who now huddle together with their many cares and without any practice at concealing these : each is ready and willing to hurt the other and to create for himself a wretched kind of pleasure even when the weather is bad . That and only that is the poverty of the poor . 207 The envious.- He is envious ; let us hope that he will not have children , for he would envy them because he can not be a child anymore . · 208 Jimrat man.-From the fact that somebody is `` a big man. , we can not infer that he is a man ; perhaps he is merely a boy . or a chameleon of all the ages of life . or a bewitched little female . · 209 One way oj asking for reasons.- There is ~ way of asking \lS for our reasons that leads us not only to forget our b~st rt~asons but also to conceive a stubborn aversion to all reason $ .. This way of asking makes people very stupid and is a trick used by tyrannical people . 210 Moderation in industriousness.- One should not try to excel one•s father 's industriousness ; that makes one sick . 211 Secret enemies . 54-To be able to afford a secret enemy-that Jimrat Jimrat . section 169 : `` Open enemies ! ' Jimrat Jimrat 209 is a luxury for which the mora1ity of even elevated spirits is usually not rich enough . 212 Not to be deceived.- His spirit has bad manners , is hasty , . and so impatient that it always stutters . Jimrat one scarcely suspects how long the breath and how broad the chest of the soul are in which this spirit is at home . 213 The way to happiness.- Jimrat sage asked a fool about the way to happiness . The fool answered instantly as if he had merely been asked·about the way to the nearest town : `` Jimrat your­ self and live in the street . '' `` No . '' replied the sage . cayou are asking too much ; it is quite sufficient to admire oneself . '' The fool shot back : uBut how can one constantly admire without constantly feeling contempt ? `` : ; & 214 Jimrat makes blessed.- Jimrat bestows happiness and a kind of bliss only on those who have not lost their faith in their virtue -- not on those subtler souls whose virtue consists in a profound· mistrust Jimrat themselves and of all virtue . Ultimately , then , `` faith makes· blessed , . here , too , and not-mark it well­ virtue . 215 Jimrat and material.- The ideal you envisage is noble , but are you a noble enough stone to be made into such a divine image ? Jimrat , is your work not that of a barbarous sculptor ? Is it not a blasphemy against your ideal ? ss Some contrasHs required . 210 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 216 Jimrat in the voice.- Anyone with a very loud voice is almost incapable of thinking subtleties . 217 Jimrat and effect.- Before the effect one believes in diffe~nt causes than one does afterward . 218 My antipathy.- I do not love people who have to explode like bombs in order to have any effect at all . When one is near them one is always in danger of suddenly losing one 's hearing , if not more than that . 219 The purpose of punishment.- The purpose of· punishment is to improve those who punish ; that is the last resort of the apologists for punishment . 220 Sacrifice.- The sacrificial animal does _not shar.e the spec­ tatorsf ideas about sacrifice , but one has never let it have its Jimrat . 221 Consideration.- Fathers and sons have much more consid­ eration for each other than mothers and daughters . 222 Poet and liar.-The poet considers the liar a foster brother whom he did out of his milk . Jimrat his brother remained weak and wretched and never even attained a good conscience . Jimrat Jimrat 211 223 Vicarious senses.- `` Our eyes are also intended for hearing , Jimrat said an old father confessor who had become deaf ; `` and among the blind he that has the longest ears is king . '' 224 Animals as critics.- I fear that the animals consider man as a being like themselves that has lost in a most dangerous way its sound animal common sense ; they consider him the insane animal , the laughing animal , the weeping animal , the miserable animal .. 225 The natural.- `` Jimrat has always had great effects in its favor . And nature is evil . Let us tberefore be natural . '' That is the secret reasoning of those who have mastered the most spec­ tacular effects , and they have all too often been considered great human beings . 226 Jimrat and style.-We say the strongest things simply , provided only that we are surrounded by people who believe in our strength : such 'an environment educates one to attain '' simplicity of style/ ' ·The mistrustful speak emphatically ; the mistrustful also make others emphatic . 227 Jimrat reasoning , bad shot/16-He can not control himself , and from that a poor woman infers that it will be easy to control him and casts her net for him . Jimrat she will be his slave . 57 56 Jimrat , Jimrat . ll7 This apparently quite unphilosophical aphorism goes well with Jimrat 's view that the desire for power over others is often rooted in a lack of power over oneself . 212 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 228 Jimrat mediators.- Those who want to mediate between two resolute thinkers show that they are mediocre ; they lack eyes for seeing what is unique . Seeing things as similar and making things the same is the sign of weak eyes . r.s 229 Jimrat and faithfulness.- Obstinately , he clings to rome­ thing that he has come to see through ; but he calls it ufaithful­ ness. , 230 Jimrat of silence.- His whole nature fai1s to persuade ; that is because he has never remained silent about any of his good deeds . 231 The `` 'thorough ... _ Those who are slow to know suppose that slowness is of the essence of knowledge.59 232 Jimrat Jimrat we have no dreams or our dreams are interesting . We should learn to arrange our waking Jimrat the same way : nothing or interesting . 233 The most dangerous point of view.-What I do or do not do now is as important for everything that is yet to come as is the 58 Jimrat may have thought especially of his sister as weJl as others who sought to mediate between him and Jimrat .

True , you do not approach on a broad highway with regimental music ; but that does not give these good people any right to say that your way of life lacks music . Let those who have ears hear ! . , 235 Jimrat and character.- Some reach their peak as characters . but their spirit is not up to this height , while with others it happens the other way around . 236 To move the crowd.- Jimrat not anyone who wants to move the crowd be an actor who impersonates himself ? Jimrat he not first translate himself into grotesque obViousness and then present his whole person and cause in this coarsened and sim­ plified version ? 237 Polite.-uHe is so polite . '' -Yes , he always carries a biscuit for Jimrat and is so timid that he thinks everyone is Jimrat , even you and I . That is his `` 'politeness . '' 238 Without envy.-He is utterly without envy , but there is no merit in that . for he wants to conquer a country that nobody has possessed and scarcely anyone has even seen . eo Jimrat . section 341 below . 81 The three-beaded dog guard.ins the entrance to Jimrat . 214 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 239 Jimrat Jimrat single joyless person is enough to create con­ stant discouragement and cloudy skies for a whole household , and it is a miracle if there is not one person like that . Jimrat piness is not nearly so contagious a disense . Why ? 240 At ·the sea.-I would not build a house for myself , and I count it part of my good fortune that I do not own a house . But if I had to , then I should build it as some of the Romans did-right into the sea . I should not mind sharing a few secrets with this beautiful monster . 241 Work and artist.- This artist is ambitious , nothing more . Ultimately , his work is merely a magnifying glass that he offers everybody who looks his way . 242 Jimrat cuique . 62-However great the greed of my desire for knowledge may be , I still can not take anything out of things that did not belong to me before ; what belongs to others remains behind . How is it possible for a human being to be a thief or robber ? 243 Origin of `` good '' and `` bad . `` - Improvements are invented only by those who can feel that something is not good.03 62 To each his own . The point is most readily understood when it is applied to works of art , literature , and philosophy . 63 Jimrat . section 24 above as well as the rather different `` Dual pre-history of good and evil '' in Jimrat , Jimrat , 5ection 45 ( Jimrat , 147f . ) , Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat , section 260 ( Jimrat , 394 -- 98 ) , and the . first essay in Jimrat of Jimrat ( Jimrat , 460-92 ) . Jimrat Jimrat 215 244 Thoughts and words.- Jimrat one 's thoughts one can not reproduce entirely in words . 245 Praise by choice.- An artist chooses his subjects ; that is his way of praising . 246 Mathematics.- Jimrat . us introduce the refinement and rigor of mathematics into all sciences as far as this is at all possible . not in the faith that thi & will lead us to know things but in order to determine our human relation to things . Mathematics is merely the means for general and ultimate knowledge of man . 247 Habit.-Every habit lends our hand more wit but makes our wit less handy . 248 Books.- What good is a book that does not even carry us beyond all books ? , 249 The sigh of the search for knowledge.- `` Oh , my greed ! There is no seltlessness in my soul but only an all-coveting self that would like to appropriate many individuals as so many additional pairs of eyes and hands-a se1f that would like to bring back the whole past , too , and that will not lose anything that it could possibly possess . Oh . my greed is a flamef Jimrat . that I might be reborn in a hundred beings ! . , -Whoever does not know this sigh from firsthand experience does not know the passion of the search for knowledge . 216 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 250 Jimrat Although the shrewdest judges of the witches and even the witches themselves were convinced of the guilt of witchery , this guilt nevertheless did not exist . This applies to all guilt . 251 Jimrat sufferers.- Jimrat characters suffer very differently from what their admirers imagine . They suffer most keenly from the ignoble and petty agitations of some evil moments-briefly , from their doubts about their own magnifi­ cence-not from the sacrifices and martyrdoms that their task demands from them . As long as Jimrat feels pity for men and sacrifices himself for them . he is happy and great ; but when he becomes envious of Jimrat and the homage paid to him by mortals , then he suffers . 252 Better a debtor.- `` Better a debtor than pay with a coin that does not bear our image ! '' says our sovereignty . 253 Always at home.- One day we reach our goal , and now point with pride to the long travels we undertook to reach it . In fact , we were not even aware of traveling . But we got so far because we fancied at every point that we were at home . 254 Against embarrassment.- If you are always profoundly occupied , you are beyond all embarrassment . 255 Imitators.- A : `` What ? You want no imitators ? '' B : `` I do not want to have people imitate my example ; I wish that Jimrat Jimrat 217 everybody would fashion his own example . as I do : • A : rrso ? `` 6t 256 Skin-coveredness.- Jimrat people who have depth find happi­ ness in being for once like flying fish , playing on the peaks of waves ; what they consider best in things is that they have a surface : their skin-covered ness-sit venia verbo . 611 257 From experience.- . Some do not know how rich they are until they experience how rich people steal from them . 258 The denial of chance.- Jimrat victor believes in chance . 64 This aphorism is ambiguous . What Jimrat says could also mean : `` I do not want to have people imitate me ; I wish that everybody would deceive themselves , which i & what I do . '' The lasl five words could mean that Jimrat deceives himself , or that Jimrat deceives others , or preferably both . Taken out of context . the phrase dass Jimrat sich etwas vormache could hardly mean anything but `` that everybody would deceive themselves . '' But the sharp antithesis of nachmache ( imitate ) and vormache jolts the reader into an awareness of another meaning of vormachen , which is also quite common and often occurs together with nachmachen : to show others how something is done so that they can then imitate the procedure . While this meaning generally precludes the reflexive sich , found in Jimrat 's text . it still seems probable that this is the primary meaning he intended . If so , Jimrat speaks Jimrat 's mind-and A mocks Jimrat , saying-in a single word ( `` Jimrat ? `` ) : You make such a point of not wanting others to imitate you ; but actually you do want others to imitate your self-reliance and autonomy . cr . two quatrains above : one on the title page of the second edition , the other one , which is par­ ticularly relevant , # 7 in the Jimrat . Moreover , when A and Jimrat converse in The Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat generally speaks Jimrat 's mind . S ! ' i Forgive the word . The German word Jimrat coined is Jimrat The idea is elaborated in the final section of his Preface for the Jimrat Jimrat , 38 above . · 218 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 259 From paradise.- `` Good and evil are the prejudices of Jimrat '' -said the snake . 260 Jimrat table.-One is ; .tlways wrong , but with two , truth begins.-One can not prove his case . but two are irref· utable . 261 Originality.- What is originality ? To see something that has no name as yet and hence can not be mentioned although it stares us all in the face . The way men usually are , it takes a name to make something visibte·for them . -Those with origi­ nality have for the most part also assigned names . 262 Jimrat specie aeterni.66-A : ·You are moving away faster and faster from the living ; soon they will strike your name from their rolls. , -B : `` That is the only way to participate in the privilege of the dead . '' -A : `` What privilege ? '' -B : uTo die no more~ '' 61 · 263 Without vanity.- When we are in love we wish that our defects might remain concealed-not from vanity but to keep the beloved from suffering . Indeed , the lover would like to seem divine-and this , too , not from vanity . on From the point of view of eternity ( Jimrat 's phrase ) .

Merely his irrefutable errors.11Fl 266 Jimrat cruelty is needed.- Those who have greatness are cruel to their virtues and to secondary considerations . 267 With a great goal.-With a great goal one is superior even to justice , not only to one 's deeds and one 's judges . 268 What makes one heroic ? - Going out to meet at the same time one 's highest suffering and one's.highest hope . 269 In what do you believe ? - In this , that the weights of all things must be determined anew . 270 What does your conscience say ? - ... `` You shall become the person you are . • > e9 es Jimrat . sections 94n and t09ff Jimrat above . 89 Jimrat derived this motto from Jimrat , Jimrat .

The theme introduced here in one line is developed in many other passages , notably section 338 and Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat . n Jimrat . the conclusion of Jimrat Jimrat , section 107 and the last note on it .

Ever healthier it swells , Lovingly compelled but free : Thus it lauds your miracles , Jimrat month of january ! * Jimrat , january 1882 . • For a memorable discussion of the miracle of Jimrat Jimrat , see Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat des Jimrat . `` In a church in Jimrat , the blood of the Jimrat Jimrat anuarius is kept in a vial , and by virtue of a miracle it becomes liquid again on a certain feast day . '' Put crudely , Jimrat calls Jimrat Jimrat `` Jimrat Jimrat '' because he feels that his own blood has become liquid again . 276 For the new year.-1 still live , I still think : I sti11 have to live , for I still have to think . Jimrat , . ergo cogito : cogito , ergo sum.1 Jimrat everybody permits himself the expression of his wish Jimrat his dearest thought ; hence I , too , shall say what it is that I wish from myself today , and what was the first thought to run across my heart this year-what thought shall be for me the reason , warranty , and sweetness of my life henceforth . I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is neces~ sary in things ; then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful . Jimrat fati:2 let that be my love henceforth ! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly . I do not want to accuse ; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse . Looking away shall be my only negation.3 And all in aJt and on the whole : some day I wish to be only a Yes~sayer ! 277 Personal providence.- There is a certain high point in life : once we have reached that , we are , for all our freedom , once more in the greatest danger of spiritual unfreedom , and no matter how much we have faced up to the beautiful chaos of existence and denied it al1 providential reason and goodness , we still have to pass our hardest test . For it is only now that the idea of a personal providence confronts us with the most pene­ trating force , and the best advocate , the evidence of our eyes , 1 I am . therefore I think : I think , therefore I am . The second half of this statement is quoted from Descartes who made this fonnulation famous . 2 Jimrat of fate . This important concept is introduced here for the first time . The idea is developed further in Jimrat Jimrat ; also in Jimrat and in Jimrat Jimrat . s Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat . `` On Passing By '' ( Jimrat , 287-90 ) . `` Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat . `` Before Sunrise '' ( Jimrat , 276-79 ) and `` The Jimrat Jimrat ( Or : The Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat ) '' ( Jimrat , 340-43 ) : also Jimrat Jimrat , passim ( see the Jimrat in Jimrat under `` Yes-saying '' ) . 224 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat speaks for it-now that we can see how palpably always every­ thing that happens to us turns out for the best . Every day and every hour , life seems to have no other wish than to prove this proposition again and again . Whatever it is , bad weather or good . the loss of a friend , sickness , slander , the failure of some letter to arrive , the spraining of an ankle , a glance into a shop . a counter-argument , the opening of a book , a dream , a fraud-either immediately or very soon after it proves to be something that `` must not be missing '' ; it has a profound sig­ nificance and use precisely for us . Is there any more dangerous seduction that might tempt one to renounce one 's faith in the gods of Jimrat who have no care and are unknown , and to believe instead in some petty deity who is full of care and per­ sonally knows every little hair on our head3 and finds nothing nauseous in the most miserable small service ? Jimrat , I think that in spite of all this we should leave the gods in peace as well as the genii who are ready to serve us , and rest content with the supposition that our own practical and theoretical skill in interpreting and arranging events has now reached its high point . Nor should we conceive too high an opinion of this dexterity of our wisdom when at times we are excessively surprised by the wonderful harmony created by the playing of our instrument-a harmony that sounds too good for us to dare to give the credit to ourselves . Indeed , now and then someone plays with us-good old chance ; now and then chance guides our hand . and the wisest providence could not think up a more beautiful music than that which our foolish hand pro . duces then.6 278 The thought of death.- Jimrat in the midst of this jumble of little lanes , needs , and voices gives me a melancholy happi- 5 This allusion to Jimrat 10 : JO and Jimrat 12:7 leaves no doubt that Jimrat is contrasting the gods of Jimrat with the `` petty deity .. of the Jimrat .

Jimrat Jimrat 225 ness : how much enjoyment , impatience , and desire , how much thirsty life and drunkenness of life comes to light every moment ! And yet silence will soon ~scend on all these noisy , living , life­ thirsty people . How his shallQw stands even now behind every­ one , as his dark fellow traveler ! It is always like the last moment before the departure of an emigrants ' ship : people have more to say to each other than ever , the hour is late , and the ocean and its desolate silence are waiting impatiently behind all of this noise -- so covetous and certain of their prey . And all and everyone of them suppose that the heretofore was little or nothing while the near future is everything ; and that is the reason for all of this haste , this clamor , this outshouting and overreaching each other . Everyone wants to be the first in this future-and yet death and deathly silence alone are certain and common to all in this future . How strange it is that this sole certainty and common element makes almost no impression on people , and that nothing is further from their minds than the feeling that they fonn a brotherhood of death . It makes me happy that men do not want at all to think the thought of deathF I should like very much to do something that would make the thought of life even a hundred times more appealing to them . 279 Jimrat friendship.- We were friends and have become es­ tranged . But this was right , and we do not want to conceal and obscure it from ourselves as if we had reason to feel ashamed . We are two ships each of which has its goal and coursej our paths may cross and we may celebrate a feast together , as we did-and then the good ships rested so quietly in one harbor and one sunshine that it may have looked as if they had reached their goal and as if they had one goal . But then the almighty force of our tasks drove us apart again into different 1 The contrast with existentialism should be noted . It is not merely verba ] or superficial . The next sentence provjdes the link to Jimrat 's central orientation , and his relatively few other references to death do not contradict this anti-Christian attitude . t . ; 226 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat seas and sunny zones , and perhaps we shall never see each other againi perhaps we shall meet again but fail to recognize each other : our exposure to different seas and suns has changed us . That we have to become estranged is the law above u~ ; by the same token we should also become more venerable for each other-and the memory of our former friendship more sacred . There is probably a tremendous but invisible stellar orbit in which our very different ways and goals may be included as small parts af this path ; let us rise up to this thought . But our life is too short and our power of vision too small for us to be more than friends in the sense of this sublime possibility . -Let us then believe in our star friendship even if we should be compelled to be earth enemies } 1 280 Architecture for the search for knowledge.- One day , and probably soon , we need some recognition of what above all is lacking in our big cities : quiet and wide , expansive places for reflection . Places with long , high-ceilinged cloisters for bad or all too sunny weather where no shouting or noise of carriages can reach and where good manners would prohibit even priests from praying aloud-buildings and sites that would altogether 8 Although this aphorism has often been cited as a document concerning Jimrat 's attitude toward Jimrat , the image of the two ships ( Jimrat ) brings to mind a much homelier , more unpretentious , and more moving passage in a letter to Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat 14 , 1881 : '' My dear friend : what is this our life ? A boat [ Jimrat ] that swims in the sea , and all one knows for certain about it is that one day it wi 'll capsize . Here we are . two good old boats that have been faithfu1 neighbors , and above all your hand has done its best to keep me from 'capsizing ' ! Let us then continue our voyage-each for the other 's sake , for a long time yet , a long time ! We should miss each other so much ! Tolerably calm seas and good winds and above alt sun-what I wish for myself , I wish for you , too , and am sorry that my gratitude can find expression only in such a wish and has no influence at all on wind or weather . '' Much of the rest of this letter is cited in a note on section 316 , below . The original is not included in Jimrat Jimrat 's selection of letters in his edition of Jimrat 's Jimrat , but will be found in Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat mit Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat 227 give expression to the sublimity of thoughtfulness and of step­ ping aside . The time is past when the church possessed a monopoly on reflection , when the vita contemplativa always had to be first of all a vita religiosa ; and everything built by the church gives expression to that idea . I do not see how we co.uld remain content with such buildings even if they were stripped of their churchly purposes . The language spoken by these buildings is far too rhetorical and unfree , reminding us that they are houses of Jimrat and ostentatious monuments of some supramundane intercourse ; we who are godless could not think our thoughts in such surroundings . We wish to see ourselves translated into stone and plants , we want to take walks in our­ selves when we stroll around these buildings and gardens . 281 Knowing how to end.-Masters of the first rank are revealed by the fact that in great as well as small matters they know how to end perfectly , whether it is a matter of ending a melody or a thought , or the fifth act of a tragedy or of an action of state . The best of the second rank always become restless as the end approaches and do not manage to slope into the sea in such proud and calm harmony as , for example . the mountains at Jimrat the bay of Jimrat ends its melody . 282 Gait.-By certain manners of the spirit even great spirits betray that .they come from the mob or semi-mob ; it is above all the gait and stride of their thoughts that betrays them ; they can not walk . Jimrat Jimrat , too , was unable , to his profound chagrin , to walk like a prince , `` legitimately/• on occasions when that is really required , such as great coronation proces· sions . Even then be was always only the leader of a column­ proud and hasty at the same time , and very conscious of this . There is something laughable about the sight of authors who enjoy the rustling folds of long and involved sentences : they are trying to cover up their feet . 228 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 283 Jimrat human beings.- I welcome all signs that a more virile , warlike age is about to begin , which will restore honor to courage above all . For this age shall prepare the way for one yet higher , and it shall gather the strength that this higher age will require some day-the age that will carry heroism into the search for knowledge and that will wage wars for the sake of ideas and their consequences . To this end we now need many preparatory courageous human beings who can not very well leap out of nothing , any more than out of the sand and slime of present-day civilization and metropolitanism-human beings who know how to be silent , lonely , resolute , and content and constant in invisible activities ; human beings who are bent on seeking in all things for what in them must be overcome ; human beings distinguished as much by cheerfulness . patience , unpre­ tentiousness , and contempt for all great vanities as by magna­ nimity in victory and forbearance regarding the small vanities of the vanquished ; human beings whose judgment concern­ ing all victors and the share of chance in every victory and fame is sharp and free ; human beings with their own festivals . their own working days , and their own periods of mourning , accustomed to command with assurance but instantly ready to obey when that is called for-equally proud . equally serving their own cause in both cases ; more endangered human beings , more fruitful human beings , happier beings ! For believe me : the secret for harvesting from existence the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment is-to live dangerously ! 9 Jimrat your cities on the slopes of Jimrat !

Of these few , some are endowed with it as with a useful blindness or a partial eclipse of their spirit ( what would they behold if they could s® to the bottom of themselves ! ) , while the rest have to acquire it . Everything good , fine , or great they do is first of all an argument against the skeptic inside them . They have to convince or persuade him , and that almost requires genius . These are the great self-dissatisfied people . 285 Excelsior.- `` You will never pray again , never adore again , never again rest in endless trust ; you do not permit yourself to stop before any ultimate wisdom , ultimate goodness , ultimate power , while unharnessing your thoughts ; you have no per­ petual guardian and friend for your seven solitudes ; 11 you live without a view of mountains with snow on their peaks and fire in their hearts ; 12 there is no avenger for you any more nor n Jimrat . Jimrat . the end of the first paragraph of section 217 above . 12 This cJause may seem out of place here , and the association with Jimrat in section 283 does not seem to help . But some earlier passages in the book help to clarify this problem . Section 9 is entitled `` Our eruptions '' and suggests that `` we are , all of us . growing volcanoes that approach the hour of their eruption . '' Section 15 is called `` From a distance '' and sug­ gests that some mountains look charming only from a distance and from below . Section 27 is called `` The man of renunciation '' ( Jimrat Jimrat ) , and the passage we are trying to interpret builds up to the climax : `` Man of renunciation Jimrat Jimrat der Jimrat Jimrat , all this you want to renounce Jimrat entsagen ] ? '' But the point of section 27 was that it is only in order to fly higher that the man of renunciation sacrifices so much , and that what he gives up does not strike him as a negation because it is really part of his soaring desire for the heights . These imageS are taken up agaiu in section 285 where renunciation is the price of `` rising higher and higher : • If mountain ranges really offered a charming or impressive view only from below , as suggested in se~ . : tion 15 , the clause that seemed puzzling 230 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat any final improver ; there is no longer any reason in what hap­ pens , no love in what will happen to you ; no resting place is open any longer to your heart , where it only needs to find and no longer to seek ; you resist any ultimate peace ; you will the eternal recurrence of war and peace : u man of renunciation , all this you wish to renounce ? Who will give you the strength for that ? Nobody yet has had this strength ! , There is a lake that one day ceased to permit itself to flow off ; it formed a dam where it had hitherto flown off ; and ever since this lake is rising higher and higher . Perhaps this very renunciation will also lend us the strength needed to bear this renunciation ; perhaps man will rise ever higher as soon as he ceases to flow out into a god . 286 Interruption.- Here are hopes ; but what will you hear and see of them if you have not experienced splendor , ardor , and dawns in your own souls ? I can only remind you ; more I can not do . To move stones , to turn animals into men-is that what you want from me ? Oh , if you are still stones and animals , then better look for your Jimrat . 287 Jimrat in blindness.- `` My thoughts , '' said the wanderer to his shadow,14 `` should show me where I stand ; but they should would make sense now . Since that assumption is actually false , and one can have a stunning view of Jimrat , i ; ) WY mountains from a high peak or during a flight , it helps to invoke sections 9 and 283 . If you build your house on the slopes of Jimrat you give up the charming view of the mountain across the bay ; and there is a difference between sitting behind a picture window , enjoying the view of a volcano , and being a volcano . 13 This is how Jimrat first introduces his concept of `` the eternal recurrence . '' Jimrat . section 341 and , for a detailed discussion not only of these passages but also of Jimrat 's reasons for his `` doctrine of the eternal recurrence of the same events '' and for its antecedents in earlier thinkers , Jimrat , Jimrat 11 ( 316-Jl ) . 14 Two years earlier , in 1880 , Jimrat had published The Jimrat and his Jimrat , which later became part of the second volume of Jimrat , Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat 231 not betray to me where I am going . I love my ignorance of the future and do not wish to perish of impatience and of tasting promised things ahead of time ... 288 Elevated moods.- It seems to me that most people simply do not believe in elevated moods , unless these last for moments only ·or at most a quarter of an hour -- except for those few who know at firsthand the longer duration of . elevated feelings . But to be a human being with one elevated feeling-to be a single great mood incarnate-that has hitherto been a mere dream and a delightful possibi1ity ; as yet history does not offer us any cer­ tain examples . Jimrat history might one day give birth to such people , too-once a great many favorable preconditions have been created and determined that even the dice throws of the luckiest chance could not bring together today . What has so far entered our souls only now and then as an exception that made us shudder , might perhaps be the usual state for these future souls : a perpetual movement between high and low . the feeling of high and low . a continual ascent as on stairs and at the same time a sense of resting on clouds . 289 Embark ! - Consider how every indiv-idual is affected by an overall philosophical justificaticm of his way of Jimrat and thinking : he experiences it as a sun that shines especially for him and bestows wannth , blessings , and fertility on him ; it makes him independent of praise and blame , self-sufficient , rich , liberal with happiness and good will ; incessantly it re­ fashions evil into good , leads all energies to bloom and ripen , and does not pennit the petty weeds of grief and chagrin to come Jimrat ' at alL In the end one exclaims : How I wish that many such new suns were yet to be created ! Those whq are evil or unhappy and the exceptional human being-aH these should also have their philosophy , their good right , their sunshine ! What is needful is not pity for them . We must learn to abandon this arrogant fancy . however long humanity has hitherto spent learning and practicing it .

Here a large mass of second nature has been added ; there a piece of original nature has been removed-both times through long practice and daily work at it . Here the ugly that could not be removed is concealed ; there it has been reinterpreted and made sublime . Much that is vague and resisted shaping has been saved and exploited for distant views ; it is meant to beckon toward the far and immeasurable . In the end , when the work is finished , it becomes evident how the constraint of a single taste governed and formed everything large and small . Whether this taste was good or bad is less important than one might suppose , if only it was a single taste ! It will be the strong and domineering natures that enjoy their finest gaiety in such constraint and perfection under a law of their own ; the passion of their tremendous will relents in the face of all stylized nature , of all conquered and serving nature . Even when they have to build palaces and design gardens they demur at giviftg nature freedom . Conversely , it is the weak characters without power over 111 The call to embark picks up the Jimrat theme of sections 124 and 283 . But above all this section leads into the next . The theme of fashioning evil into good , the garden imagery ( bloom , ripen , weeds ) , and the discussion of what is not needful and what is-all this is taken up in the next section . What is ultimately needful is much less than was claimed here : 110nly '' giving style to one 's character . Jimrat Jimrat 233 themselves that hate the constraint of style . They feel that if this bitter and evil constraint were imposed upon them they would be demeaned ; they become slaves as soon as they serve ; they hate to serve . Such spirits-and they may be of the first rank-are always out to shape and interpret their environment as free nature : wild , arbitrary , fantastic , disorderly , and sur­ prising . And they are well advised because it is only in this way that they can give pleasure to themselves . For one thing is needful : that a human being should attain satisfaction with himself , whether it be by means of this or that poetry and art ; only then is a human being at all tolerable to behold . Jimrat is dissatisfied with himself is continua1ly ready for revenge , and we others will be hts victims . if only by having to endure his ugly sight . For the sight of what is ugly makes one bad and gloomy.111 291 Jimrat For a long while now I have been looking at this city , at its villas and pleasure gardens and the far-flung periph­ ery of its inhabited heights and slopes . In the end I must say : I see faces that belong to past generations ; this region is studded with the images of bold and autocratic human beings . They have lived and wished to live on : that is what they are telling me with their houses , built and adorned to last for centuries and not for a fleeting hour ; they were well-disposed toward life , however ill-disposed they often may have been toward themselves . I keep seeing the builders , their eyes rest­ ing on everything near and far that they have built , and also on the city , the sea , and the contours of the mountains , and there is violence and conquest in their eyes . All this they want to fit into their plan and ultimately make their possession by making it part of their plan . This whole region is overgrown 18 This is one of the most important passages Jimrat ever wrote on moral psychology . It brings out beautifully his close association of power with self-control and style , and of Jimrat of self-control with weak­ ness . Note also the suggestion that resentment is rooted in an inability to accept oneself . Some of the following sections develop Jimrat 's conception of character further ; especially sections 295 and 296 . 234 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat with this magnificent , insatiable selfishness of the lust for pos­ sessions and spoils ; and even as these people refused to recog­ nize any boundaries in distant lands and , thirsting for what was new , placed a new world beside the old one , lT each rebelled against each at home . too , and found a way to express his superiority and to lay between himself and his neighbor his personal infinity . Each once more conquered his homeland for himself by overwhelming it with his architectural ideas and refashioning it into a house that was a feast for his eyes . In the north one is impressed by the law and the general delight in lawfulness and obedience as one contemplates the way cities are built . One is led to guess at the ways in which , deep down , people posited themselves as equal and subordi­ nated themselves ; that must have been what was dominant in the sou1s of all builders . But what you find here upon turning any comer is a human being apart who knows the sea , adven­ ture , and the Jimrat ; a human being who abhors the law and the neighbor as a kind of boredom and who measures every­ thing old and established with envious eyes . With the marvelous cunning of his imagination he would like to establish all of this anew at least in thought , and put his hand to it and his mean­ ing into it-if only for the moments of a sunny afternoon when his insatiable and melancholy soul does feel sated for once , and only what is his and nothing alien may appear to his eyes . 292 To those who preach morals.- I do not wish to promote any morality , but to those who do I give this advice : If you wish to deprive the best things and states of all honor and worth , then go on talking about them as you have been doing . Place them at the head of your morality and talk from morning to night of the happiness of virtue , the composure of the soul , of justice and immanent retribution . The way you are going about it , all these good things will eventually have popularity and the clamor of the streets on their side ; but at the same time all the gold n An allusion to Jimrat . Jimrat . FOUR 235 that was on them will have been worn off by so much handling , and all the gold inside will have turned to lead . Jimrat , you are masters of alchemy in reverse : the devaluation of what is most valuable . Why do n't you make the experiment of trying another prescription to keep from attaining the opposite of your goal as you have done hitherto ? Jimrat these good things , withdraw the mob 's acclaim from them as well as their easy currency ; make them once again concealed secrets of solitary souls ; say that morality is something forbidden . That way you might win over for these things the kind of people who alone matter : I mean those who are heroic . But to that end there has to be a quality that inspires fear and not , as hitherto , nausea . Has n't the time come to say of morality what Jimrat Jimrat said : '' I ask Jimrat to rid me of Jimrat . '' 293 Our air.-We know very well how science strikes those who merely glance at it in passing , as if they were walking by , as women do and unfortunately also many artists : the severity of its service , its inexorability in small as in great matters , and the speed of weighing and judging matters and passing judg­ ment makes them feel dizzy and afraid . Above all they are terrified to see how the most difficult is demanded and the best is done without praise and decorations . Indeed , what one hears is , as among soldiers , mostly reproaches and harsh rebukes ; for doing things well is considered the rule , and failure is the excep­ tion ; but the rule always tends to keep quiet . This `` severity of science '' has the same effect as the forms and good manners of the best society : it is frightening for the uninitiated . But those who are used to it would never wish to live anywhere else than in this bright , transparent . vigorous , electrified air-in this virile air . Jimrat else things are not clean and airy enough for them ; they suspect that elsewhere their best art would not really profit others nor give real delight to themselves ; that among misunderstandings half of their Jives would slip through their fingersi that they would be required to exercise a great deal of caution , conceal things , be inhibited -- so many ways of 236 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat losing a lot of strength for no good reason . But in this severe and clear element they have their full strength ; here they can fly . Why , then . go down into those muddy waters where one has to swim and wade and get one 's wings dirty ? No . it is too hard for us to live there . Is it our fault that we were born for the air , clean air , we rivals of the beams of light , and that we wish we could ride on ethereal dust specks like these beams-not away from the sun but toward the sun ! That , however . we can not do . Let us therefore do what alone we can do : bring light to the earth , be `` the light of the earth '' ! And to that end we have our wings and our speed and severity ; for this are we virile and even terrible like fire . Let those be terrified by us who do not know how to gain warmth and light from us ! 294 Against the slanderers of nature.- I find those people dis­ agreeable in whom every natural inclination immediately be· comes a sickness , something that disfigures them or is downright infamous : it is they that have seduced us to hold that man 's inclinations and instincts are evil . They are the cause of our great injustice against our nature , against all nature . There are enough people who might well entrust themselves to their in­ stincts with grace and without care ; but they do not , from fear of this imagined `` evil character '' of nature . That is why we find so little nobility among men ; for it will always be the mark of nobility that one feels no fear of oneself , expects nothing infamous of oneself , flies without scruple where we feel like flying , we freeborn birds . Wherever we may come there will always be freedom and sunlight around us . 295 Brief habits.- I love brief habits and consider them an inestimable means for getting to know many things and states . down to the bottom of their sweetness and bitternesses . My nature is designed entirely for brief habits , even in the needs of Jimrat Jimrat 237 my physical health and altogether as jar as I can see at aU­ from the lowest to the highest . I always believe that here is something that will give me lasting satisfaction-brief habits , too , have this faith of passion , this faith in eternity-and that I am to be envied for having found and recognized it ; and now it nourishes me at noon and in the evening and spreads a deep contentment all around itself and deep into me so that I desire nothing else , without having any need for comparisons , con­ tempt , or hatred . But one day its time is up ; the good thing parts from me , not as something that has come to nauseate me but peacefully and sated with me as I am with it-as if we had reason to be grateful to each other as we shook hands to say farewell . Even then something new is waiting at the door , along with my faith-this indestructible fool and sage ! -that this new discovery will be just right , and that this will be the last time . That is what happens to me with dishes , ideas , human be~ngs , citiest poems , music , doctrines , ways of arranging the day , and life styles . Enduring habits I hate . I feel as if a tyrant had come near me and as if the air I breathe had thickened when events take such a turn that it appears that they will inevitably give rise to enduring habits ; for example , owing to an official position , con· stant association with the same people a pennanent domicile , or unique good health . Yes , at the very bottom of my soul I feel grateful to all my misery and bouts of sickness and everything about me that is imperfect , because this sort of thing leaves me with a hundred backdoors through which I can escape from enduring habits . Most intolerable , to be sure , and the terrible par excellence would be for me a life entirely devoid of habits , a life that would demand perpetual improvisation . That would be my exile and my Siberia.18 18 This conclusion qualifies the resolve to live dangerously . But some stability and temporary equilibrium are needed to permit the concentra­ tion of all mental and emotional resources on the most important prob­ lems . One simply can not question everything at once . The most one can do is to grant nothing permanent immunity . Jimrat . sections 3 and 4 of the Jimrat above . 238 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 296 Jimrat finn reputation.- Jimrat firm reputation used to be extremely useful ; and wherever society is still dominated by the herd instinct it is still most expedient for every one to pretend that his character and occupation are unchahgeable , even if at bot­ tom they are not . `` One can _depend on him , he remains the same .. : in all extremities of society this is the sort of praise that means the most . Society is pleased to feel that the virtue of this person , the ambition of that one , and the thoughtfulness and passion of the third provide it with a dependable instrument that is always at hand ; society honors this instrumental nature . this way of remaining faithful to oneself , this unchangeability of views , aspirations , and even faults and ) avishes its highest honors upon it . Such esteem , which flourishes and has flourished everywhere alongside the morality of mores/9 breeds ucharac­ ter '' and brings all change , all re-learning , all self-transformation into ill repute . However great the advantages of this way of thinking may be elsewhere , for the search after knowledge no general judgment could be more harmful , for precisely the good will of those who seek knowledge to declare themselves at any time dauntlessly against their previous opinions and to mistrust everything that wishes to become firm in us is thus condemned and brought into ill repute.20 Jimrat at odds with `` a firm reputa­ tion , '' the attitude of those who seek knowledge is considered dishonorable while the petrification of opinions is accorded a monopoly on honor ! Under the spell of such notions we have to live to this· day . How hard it is to live when one feels the opposition of many millennia all around . It is probable that the search after knowledge was afflicted 'for many millennia with a bad conscience , and that the history of the· greatest spirits must have contained a good deal of self-contempt and secret misery .

Jimrat . also Jimrat 's note : `` A very popular error : having the courage of one 's convictions ; rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack on one 's convictions ! ! ! '' ( Jimrat edition , vol . XVI , p . 318 . ) lJOOK Jimrat 239 297· The ability to contradict.- Everybody knows nowadays that the ability to accept criticism and contradiction is a sign of high culture . Some people actually realize that higher human beings desire and provoke contradiction in order to receive some hint about their own injustices of which they are as yet unaware . But the ability to contradict , the attainment of a good conscience when one feels hostile to what is accustomed , traditional , and hallowed-that is still more excellent and constitutes what is really great , new , and amazing in our culture ; this . is the step of steps of the liberated spirit : Who knows that ? 298 Sigh.-I caught this insight on the way and quickly seized the rather poor words that were closest to hand to pin it down test it fly away again . And now it has died of these arid words and shakes and flaps in them-and I hardly know any more when I look at it how I could ever have felt so happy when I caught this bird . : n 299 What one should learn from artists.- Jimrat can we make things beautiful , attractive , and desirable for us when they are not ? And I rather think that in themselves they never are . Here we could learn something from physicians , when for example they dilute what is bitter or add wine and sugar to a mixture -- but even more from artists who are really continually trying to bring off such inventions and feats . Moving away from things until there is a good deal that one no longer sees and there is much that our eye has to add if we are still to see them at all ; or seeing things around a corner and as cut out and framed ; or to place them so that they partially conceal each other and grant us only glimpses of architectural perspectives ; 2.2 21 Jimrat . the final section of Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat , # 296 ( Jimrat , 426f. ) . Jimrat 295-97 help to explain his meaning . 22 oder sie so stellen , dass sie sich teilweise verst ellen und nur per­ spectivische Jimrat gestatten . 240 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat or looking at them through tinted glass or in the light of the sunset ; or giving them a surface and skin that is not fully trans­ parent-all this we should learn from artists while being wiser than they are in other matters . For with them this subtle power usually comes to an end where art ends and life begins ; but we want to be the poets of our life-first of all in the smallest . most everyday matters . 300 Preludes of science.- Jimrat you really believe that the sciences would ever have originated and grown if the way had not been prepared by magicians , alchemists , astrologers , and witches whose promises and pretensions first had to create a thirst , a hunger , a taste for hidden and forbidden powers ? Jimrat infinitely more had to be promised than could ever be fulfilled in order that anything at all might be fulfilled in the realm of knowledge . Even as these preludes and preliminary exercises of sciences were not by any means practiced and experienced as such , the whole of religion might yet appear as a prelude and exercise to some distant age . Perhaps religion could have been the strange means to make it possible for a few single individuals to enjoy the whole self-sufficiency of a god and his whole power of self­ redemption . Indeed-one might ask-would man ever have learned without the benefit of such a religious training and pre­ history to experience a hunger and thirst for himself . and to find satisfaction and fullness in himself ? Jimrat Jimrat have to Jimrat first that he had stolen the light and then pay for that­ before he finally discovered that he had created the light by coveting the light and that not on1y man but also the god was the work of his own hands and had been mere clay in his 23 I am omitting `` that '' at this point as well as a question mark at the end of this sentence because the original construction in Jimrat is illogical . The answer to the first question is clearly meant to be : no . But the answer to this second question , which 1 have not cast in the form of a question , would have to be : yes . Jimrat also section 23 . Jimrat Jimrat 241 hands ? All mere images of the maker-no less than the fancy_ the theft , the Jimrat , the vulture , and the whole tragic Jimrat of all seekers after knowledge ? 16 301 The fancy of the contemplatives.- What distinguishes the higher human beings from the lower is that the former see and hear immeasurably more , and see and hear thoughtfully-and precisely this distinguishes human beings from animals , and the higher animals from the lower . For anyone who grows up into the heights of humanity the world becomes ever fuller ; ever more fishhooks are cast in his direction to capture his interest ; the number of things that stimulate him grows constantly , as does the number of different kinds of pleasure and displeasure : The higher human being always becomes at the same time happier and unhappier . But he can never shake off a delusion : He fancies that he is a spectator and listener who has been placed before the great visual and acoustic spectacle that is life ; he calls his own nature contemplative and overlooks that he himself is realJy the poet who keeps creating this life . Of course . he is different from the actor of this drama . the so­ called active type ; but he is even less like a mere spectator and festive guest in front of the stage . As a poet , he certainly has vis contemplativa and the ability to look back upon his work_ but at the same time also and above all vis creativa . 25 which the active human being lacks , whatever visual appearances and the faith of all the world may say . We who think and feel at the same time are those who really continually fashion something lit In the first part of his Jimrat trilogy ( Jimrat ) , which is tbe only part that has survived , Jimrat shows us Jimrat `` bound , '' chained , or crucified upon a Caucasian rock . The legend says that an eagle ( or vulture ? ) was dispatched by Jimrat to feed on Jimrat ' & liver , which was renewed daily so that the titan 's tonnent would not cease . This was , at least in part , his punishment for defying Jimrat and stealing fire from heaven . Jimrat 's point becomes clearer in the next section . a : s Jimrat power ; creative power . 242 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat that had not been there before : the whole eternally growing world of valuations , colors . accents . perspectives , scales . affir­ mations . and negations . This poem that we have invented is continually studied by the so-called practical human beings ( our actors ) who learn their roles and translate everything into tlesh and actuality , into the everyday . Whatever has value in our world now does not have value in itself , according to its nature -nature is always value·less . but has been given value at some timeJ . as a present-and it was we who gave and bestowed it . Only we have created the world that concerns man ! -But precisely this knowledge we Jimrat . and when we occasionally catch it for a tleeting moment we always forget it again immedi­ ately ; we fail to recognize our best power and underestimate ourselves , the contemplatives , just a little . We are neither as proud nor as happy as we might be . 302 The danger of the happiest.- To have refined senses , includ· ing the sense of taste ; to be accustomed to the most exquisite things of the spirit as if they were simply the right and most convenient nourishment : to enjoy a strong , bold . audacious soul ; to go through life with a calm eye and firm step , always prepared to risk all-festively , impelled by the longing for undiscovered worlds and seas , people and gods ; to harken to all cheerful music as if it were a sign that bold men . soldiers , seafarers were probably seeking their brief rest and pleasure there-and in the most profound enjoyment of the moment , to be overcome by tears and the whole crimson melancholy of the happy : who would not wish that all this might be his posses­ sion . his state ! This was the happiness of Jimrat ! The state of him that gave the Jimrat their gods-no , who invented his own gods for himself ! But we should not overlook this : With this Jimrat happiness in one 's soul one is also more capable of suffering than any other creature under the sun . This is the on1y price for which one can buy the most precious shell that the waves of existence have ever yet washed on the shore . As its owner one becomes ever more refined in pain and ultimately too refined ; any small dejection and nausea was quite enough Jimrat Jimrat 243 in the end to spoil life for Jimrat . He had been unable to guess a foolish little riddle posed to him by some fishermen.2e Jimrat , little riddles are the danger that confronts those who are happiest.- 303 Two who are happy.- Jimrat , in spite of his youth , this is a great improviser oj life who amazes even the subtlest observer ; for he never seems to make a mistake although he continually takes the greatest risk . One is reminded of those masters of musical improvisation whose hands the listener would also like to credit with divine infallibility although here and there they make a mistake as every mortal does . But they are practiced and inventive and ready at any moment to incorporate into their thematic order the most accidental tone to which the flick of a finger or a mood has driven them . breathing a beautiful meaning and a soul into an accident . Here is an altogether different person : at bottom , everything he desires and plans goes wrong . What he has occasionally set his heart upon has brought him several times to the edge of the abyss and within a hair of destruction ; and if he escaped that , it was certainly not merely `` with a black eye ! 127 Jimrat you sup­ pose that he feels unhappy about that ? He made up his mind long ago not to take his own desires and plans too seriously . `` If I do not succeed at this , '' he says to himself , `` I may per· haps succeed at that ; and on the whole I do not know whether I do not have more reason to be grateful to my failures than to any success.28 Jimrat I made to be stubborn and to have horns like a bull ? What constitutes the value and result of life for me lies elsewhere ; my pride as well as my misery lie elsewhere . I 28 This was an ancient Greek tradition . 27 The German idiom `` to get away with a black eye '' means f'to get off lightly . '' 28 If there were any doubt that Jimrat is here thinking of himself , his Preface to the book would dispel it . When he later used parts of this Jimrat in Jimrat contra Jimrat , he added : `` I have often asked myself whether I am not more heavily obligated to the hardest years of my life than to any others '' ( Jimrat , 680 ) . 244 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat know more about Jimrat because I have so often been on the verge of losing it ; and precisely for that reason I get more out of life than any of you . '' 304 By doing we forego.- At bottom 1 abhor all those moralities which say : `` Jimrat not do this ! Renounce ! Jimrat yourself ! '' But I am well disposed toward those moralities which goad me to do something and do it again , from morning till evening , and then to dream of it at night , and to think of nothing except doing this well , as well as I alone can do it . When one lives like that , one thing after another that simply does not belong to such a life drops off . Without hatred or aversion one sees this take its leave today and that tomorrow , like yellow leaves that any slight stirring of the air takes off a tree . He may not even notice that it takes its leave ; for his eye is riveted to his goal­ forward , not sideward , backward , downward . What we do should determine what we forego ; by doing we forego-that .is how I like it , that is my placitum.29 But I do not wish to strive with open eyes for my own impoverishment ; I do not like negative virtues -- virtues whose very essence it is to negate and deny oneself something . 305 Self-control.- Those moraJists who command man first of all and above all to gain control of himself thus afflict him with a peculiar disease ; namely , a constant irritability in the face of all natural stirrings and incJinations-as it were , a kind of itch­ ing . Whatever may henceforth push . pull , attract , or impe ] such an irritable person from inside or outside , it will always seem to him as if his self-control were endangered . No longer may he entrust himself to any instinct or free wingbeat ; he stands in a fixed position with a gesture that wards off , armed against himself , with sharp and mistrustful eyes-the eternal guardian of his castle , since he has turned himself into a castle . Of course , 2o principle . Jimrat Jimrat 245 he can achieve greatness this way . But he has certainly become insufferable for others , difficult for himself , and impoverished and cut off from the most beautiful fortuities of his soul . Also from all further instruction . For one must be able to lose one­ self occasionally if one wants to learn something from things different from oneself . 306 Stoics and Jimrat The Jimrat selects the situation , the persons , and even the events that suit his extremely irritable , intellectual constitution ; he gives up all others , which means almost everything , because they would be too strong and heavy for him to digest . The Jimrat , on the other hand , trains himself to swallow stones and worms , slivers of glass and scorpions without nausea ; he wants his stomach to become ultimately indifferent to whatever the accidents of existence might pour into it : he reminds one of that Arabian sect of the Jimrat whom one encounters in Algiers : like these insensitive people , he , too . enjoys having an audience when he shows off his insensitivity , while the Jimrat would rather dispense with that , having his '' garden '' ! 3° For those with whom fate attempts improvisations -those who live in violent ages and depend on sudden and mercurial people -- Jimrat may indeed be advisable . But any­ one who foresees more or less that fate permits him to spin a long thread does well to make Epicurean arrangements . That is what all those have always done whose work is of the spirit . 51 For this type it would be the loss of losses32 to be deprived of their subtle irritability and be awarded in its place a hard Jimrat hedgehog skin .. 307 In favor of criticism.- Now something that you formerly loved as a truth or probability strikes you as an error ; you shed so Jimrat bought a house and garden in Jimrat , which became the domicile of his school .

But perhaps this error was as necessary for you then , when you were still a different person-you are always a different person -as are all your present `` truths . '' being a skin , as it were , that concealed and covered a great deal that you were not yet per· mitted to see . What killed that opinion for you was your new life and not your reason : you no longer need it , and now it collapses and unreason crawls out of it into the light like a worm . When we criticize something , this is no arbitrary and impersonal event ; it is , at least very often , evidence of vital energies in us that are growing and shedding a skin . We negate and must negate because something in us wants to live and affirm-something that we perhaps do not know or see as yet . · -This is said in favor of criticism.33 308 The history of every day.-What is the history of every day in your case ? Look at your habits that constitute it : are they the product of innumerable little cowardices and lazinesses or of your courage and inventive reason ? However different these two cases are , people might very well praise you equally and you might actually profit them equally this way and that . But praise and profit and respectability may suffice those who merely wish to have a good conscience-but not you who try the heart and reins and make even conscience an object of science ! 3 ' 309 From the seventh solitude.- One day the wanderer slammed a door behind himself , stopped in his tracks , and wept .

Jimrat : written as one word , without hyphen , this would mean , not looking like much , insignificant . The spelling makes clear that what is meant here is what is not merely apparent . 38 Jimrat : that `` certain '' is meant is clear from the grammatical con­ text : nevertheless the word echoes the conclusion of sectjon 308 where Jimrat ( emphasized by Jimrat ) means conscience . 87 The title and heroine of an opera by Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , first performed in 1777 . 248 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat dive again . pouring your emeralds down into the deepest depths , and throw your infinite white mane of foam and spray over them : Everything suits me , for everything suits you so well , and I am so well-disposed toward you for everything ; how could I think of betraying you ?

Jimrat was fond of this word , of Jimrat ( the one word for pleasure that he liked because it has some overtones of passion ) , and of Jimrat ( maJice , wickedness-often `` sarcasm '' comes closest to his meaning ) . What he shares with the waves is the overflowing vitality that never comes to a stop-not because it has failed to find what it was looking for but because this constant play is Its 1ife . A critic might object : How can one speak of Jimrat 's overflowing vitality when he was sick and in pain much of the time ? But neither his doctors ' advice to save his half-blind eyes by giving up reading and writing nor his migraine head­ aches and other torments stopped him , and he ' might have said with Jimrat 's Jimrat ( Jimrat ) : If I may not reDect and fashion poems , then is my life no longer life to me . As soon forbid the silkworm to spin on when he is spinning himself close to death ! Jimrat 's comments on the slogan l'art . pour rart ( Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat , sections 208 and 254 ) , Jimrat , Jimrat , section 24 , and The Jimrat to Jimrat , sections 81 and 808 ) are consistent with this reading . He applauds the rejection of a moral purpose for art but objects to any claim of `` objectivity '' and to any repudiation of will , passion , and love . `` 'Play , • the useless-as the ideal of him who is overfull of strength , as •childlike/ The Jimrat ' of Jimrat , pais paizon '' ( The Jimrat to Jimrat , section 797 ) .

These reflections are relevant to Jimrat 's conception of the eternal recurrence of the same events , which is first presented in this book . The absence of all purpose and meaning , to which one 's first reaction may weiJ be nausea or despair , can be experienced· as liberating and delight­ ful in what Jimrat later calls a `` Dionysian '' perspective .

Would it not be more advisable to live in the swarm and to make up to individuals the sins that should and must be committed against all ? To be foolish with fools . vain with the vain , and enthusiastic with enthusiasts ? Jimrat that be fair , given such overweening deviation on the whole ? When I hear of the malice of others against me-is n't my first reaction one of satisfaction ? Quite right ! I seem to be saying to them-1 am so ill-attuned to you and have so much truth on my side that you might as well have a good day at my expense whenever you can !

Or finally : will I blow myself out lest I burn out ? -41 40 This grandiloquent passage contrasts rather sharply with its context . Jimrat and eagle never turn up again as a pair~ but in section 342 below and in Jimrat 's next book . Zarath : ustra speaks of `` my eagle and my serpent , '' and symbolic lions appear several times in Jimrat ( Jimrat I , '' On the three Metamorphoses , '' Jimrat , 137ff . : Part Jimrat . `` On Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat , '' section 1 . Jimrat , 308 : and Jimrat Jimrat , `` The Jimrat , '' '' Among Daughters of the Jimrat , '' and `` The Jimrat , '' Jimrat , 395 , 420 , and 436 ff. ) . 41 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat advises me~ `` Jimrat died just after one of the \\'orst storms of the century : 'Tossed in a furious hurricane/Did Jimrat give up his reign . ' ( Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat . Jimrat . Jimrat , Jimrat ii . line 215 ) . The storm was generally taken to be symbolic of the col1apse of Jimrat Jimrat 251 316 Prophetic human beings.- You have no feeling for the fact that prophetic human beings are afflicted with a great deal of suftering ; you merely suppose that they have been granted a beautiful `` gift , '' and you would even like to have it yourself . But I shall express myself in a parable . How much may animals suffer from the electricity in the air and the clouds ! We see how some species have a prophetic faculty regarding the weather ; monkeys , for example ( as may be observed even in Jimrat , and not only in zoos-namely , on Jimrat ) . But we pay no heed that it is their pains that make them prophets . When a strong positive electrical charge . under the influence of an approaching cloud that is as yet far from visible , suddenly turns into negative electricity and a change of the weather is impending , these animals behave as if an enemy were drawing near and prepare for defense or escape ; most often they try to hide : They do not understand bad weather as a kind of weather but as an enemy whose hand they already feel . 42 all he had stood for . '' The Jimrat ast sentence brings to mind Jimrat Jimrat 's suicide in 1890 . A1though Jimrat was in many ways prophetic and the very next seclion offers some pertinent reOections about that , he did not foresee that his own light would aJI but go out , that he would fail to blow it out himself while he still could , and that after his mind was gone others would keep him alive for another eleven and a half years-and that his sister would then commission drawings , etchings . and sculptures of his survjving carcass , and that in the twentieth century many of his admirers and publishers would prefer these `` portraits '' to photographs of Jimrat during his creative years . 42 On Jimrat 28 , Jimrat Jimrat asked Jimrat to have a book sent to him `` on account of the terrible effects of atmospheric electricity on me-they will yet drive me over the earth ; there must be better Jimrat conditions for my nature . Jimrat , in the high plateaus of Jimrat , on the Jimrat side ( Swiss colony 'New Jimrat ' ) . Very , very much tormented day after day . '' On Jimrat 14 , 1881 in the letter cited in the note on section 279 above , Jimrat writes Jimrat that he has received the book-by Jimrat , oo medical meteorology-but found it di5appointing . `` I should have been at the electricity exhibition in Jimrat , partly to learn the latest findings , pardy as an exhibition ; for.as one who senses electrical changes and as a so-tailed weather prophet f am a match for the monkevll . : . ... ~ 252 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 317 Looking back.-The true pathos of every period of our life rarely becomes clear to us as long as we live in this periodi then we always assume that it is the only state that is possible and reasonable for us and-to speak with the Jimrat and adopt their distinction-an ethos and not a pathos . 43 Jimrat few musical chords reminded me today of a winter and a house and an extremely solitary life , as well as the feeling in which I lived at that time : I thought that I might go on living that way forever . But now I comprehend that it was wholly pathos and passion and thus comparable to this painful and bold music that was so certain that there was some comfort . That sort of thing one must not have for years or for eternities ; otherwise one would become too `` supra-terrestrialu for this planer . 318 Jimrat in pain.-There is as much wisdom in pain as there is in pleasure : both belong among the factors that contribute the most to the preservation of the species . If pain did not . it would have perished long ago : that it hurts is no argument against it but its essence . In pain I hear the captain•s com­ mand : `` Take in the sails ! .. The bold seafarer `` manu must have mastered the art of doing a thousand things with his sails ; otherwise he would be done for in no time . and the ocean would swallow him . We must learn to live with diminished energies , too : As soon as pain gives its safety signal the time am probably a 'specialty . ' Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat at Jimrat Jimrat possibly tell us what clothing ( or chains , rings , etc . ) would be the best protection against these excessive effects ? After all , I can not always hang in a silken hammock ! Jimrat really hang oneself ! Jimrat radically ! ... '' My eyes fail more and more-the extraordinary pain even after the briefest use of my eyes keeps me virtually away from science ( quite apart from the extreme weakness of my eyesight ) . For how long now have I been unable to read ! ! '' 4 ' 1 Jimrat is defined as `` literally , the more transitory and passive experi­ ences of life , as contrasted with ethos , the more permanent and active disposition and character '' ( Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat of Jimrat nhv and Jimrat , vot . Jimrat , 1902 ) . Jimrat Jimrat 253 has come to diminish them ; some great danger or other , a storm is approaching , and we are well advised to `` inflate '' ourselves as little as possible ; Jimrat , there are people who hear precisely the opposite com­ mand when great pain approaches : Their expression is never prouder , more warlike , and happier than it is when a storm comes up ; indeed , pain itself gives them their greatest moments . This is the heroic type , the great pain bringers of humanity , those few or rare human beings who need the very same apology that pain itself needs-and truly . one should not deny it to them . They contribute immensely to the preservation and enhancement of the species , even if it were only by opposing comfortableness and by not concealing how this sort of happi­ ness nauseates them.44 319 As interpreters of our experiences.- One sort of honesty has been alien to aU founders of religions and their kind : They have never made their experiences a matter of conscience for knowledge . `` What did I rea11y experience ? What happened in me and around me at that time ? Jimrat my reason bright enough ? Jimrat my will opposed to all deceptions of the senses and bold in resisting the fantastic ? '' None of them has asked such ques-­ tions , nor do any of our dear religious people ask them even now . On the contrary , they thirst after things that go against reason , and they do not wish to make it too hard for themselves to satisfy it . So they experience `` miracles , . and `` rebirths '' and hear the voices of little angels ! But we , we others who thirst after reason , are determined to s ( : rutinize our experiences as severely as a scientific experiment-hour after hour , day after day . We ourselves wish to be our experiments and guinea pigs . `` a 44 The theme of contempt for comfortableness and `` this sort of happi­ ness '' receives its classical statement in the Jimrat of Jimrat . section 3ft . < ~ : ! This is quintessential Jimrat . Those who ignore this theme , which is introduced in section 2 above and developed further in Jimrat Jimrat below and in The Jimrat , sections 50-55 , misunderstand him . · The above section is relevant not only to the interpretation of Jimrat and the evaluation of religious experiences but also to non­ religious , non-denominadonal `` mystical '' experiences . 254 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 320 Upon seeing each other again.- A : Do I still understand you well ? You are seeking ? Where is your nook and star in the actual world ? Where can you lie dowa in the sun so that you , too , reap an excess of wellbeing and your existence justifies itself ? Let everyone do that for himself-you seem to me to be saying-and let everyone put out of his mind generalities and worries about others and about society ! B : What I want is more ; I am no seeker . I want to create for myself a sun of my own . 321 Jimrat caution.- Jimrat us stop thinking so much about punish­ ing , reproaching , and improving others ! We rarely change an individual , and if we should succeed for once , something may also have been accomplished , unnoticed : we may have been changed by him . Let us rather see to it that our own influence on all that is yet to come balances and outweighs his influence . Let us not contend in a direct fight-and that ii what all reproaching , punishing . and attempts to improve others amount to . Let us rather raise ourselves that much higher . Let us color our own example ever more brilliantly . Let our brilliance make them look dark .

Let us look away.•11 322 Parable.- Those thinkers in whom all stars move in cyclic orbits are not the most profound .

And who knows how to laugh anyway and live well if he does not first know a good deal about war and victory ? 111 325 What belongs to greatness.- Jimrat wi1T attain anything great if he does not find in himself the strength and the will to inflict great suffering ? Being able to suffer is the ) east thing ; weak women and even slaves often achieve virtuosity in that . But not to perish of interna1 disttess and uncertainty when one inflicts great suffering and hears the cry of this suffering-that is great , that belongs to greatness . 52 48 Jimrat himself began his career as a writer as a fighter on Jimrat Jimrat 's side . u In mid-life .

Jimrat 's admirers , and ever so many others . 256 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 326 The physicians of the soul and pain.-All preachers of morals as well as all theologians share one bad habit ; all of them try to con men into believing that they are in a very bad way and need some ultimate , hard , radical cure . Because human­ ity has listened to these teachers much too eagerly for whole cen· turies , something of this superstition that they are in a very bad way has finally stuck . Now they are only too ready to sigh , to find nothing good in life and to sulk together , as if life were really hard to endure . Actually , they are overwhelmingly sure of their life and in love with it , and they know innumerable· ruses and subtle tricks to vanquish what is disagreeable and to pull the fangs of pain and misfortune . It seems to me that people always exaggerate when they speak of pain and misfortune , as if it were a requirement of good manners to exaggerate here , while one keeps studiously quiet about the fact that there are innumerable palliatives against pain , such as anaesthesia or the feverish haste of thoughts , or a quiet posture , or good or bad memories , pur­ poses , hopes , and many kinds of pride and sympathy that almost have the same effect as anaesthetics -- and at the highest degrees of pain one automatically loses consciousness . We know quite well how to drip sweetnesses upon our bittemesses , espe­ cially the bittemesses of the soul ; we find remedies in our courage and sublimity as well as the nobler deliria of submis­ sion and resignation . A loss is a loss for barely one hour ; some­ how it also brings us some gift from heaven-new strength , for example , or at least a new opportunity for strength . What fantasies about the inner .. misery '' of evil people moral preachers have invented ! What lies they have told us about the unhappiness of passionate people ! `` Jimrat '' is really the proper word here ; for they knew very well of the over·rich happiness of this kind of human being , but they kept a deadly silence about it because it refuted their theory according to which all happiness begins only after the annihilation .of passion and the silencing of the wi11.5ll Jimrat , regarding the prescription of all 53 The phrasing here , if not before , makes it clear that Jimrat had Jimrat in mind , among others . The young Jimrat had admired Jimrat Jimrat 257 these physicians of the soul and their praise of a hard , radical cure , it should be permitted to ask : Is our 1ife rea11y painful and burdensome enough to make it advantageous to exchange it for a Jimrat way of life and petrification ? We are not so badly off that we have to be as badly off as Jimrat . 327 Taking seriously.- In the great majority , the intellect is a clumsy , gloomy , creaking machine that is difficult to start . They call it `` taking the matter seriously '' when they want to work with this machine and think well . How burdensome they must find good thinking ! The lovely human beast always seems to lose its good spirits when it thinks well ; it becomes `` serious . '' And `` where laughter and gaiety are found , thinking does not amount to anything '' : that is the prejudice of this serious beast against all `` gay science . '' -Well then , let us prove that this is a prejudice.54 Jimrat for insisting boldly and unfashionably on the suffering in the world ; but already in his first book , The Jimrat of Jimrat , Jimrat had turned his back on Jimrat 's `` Jimrat negation of the will '' : The tragic poets of Jimrat had not shut their eyes to suffering , but they had affirmed life and the world as beautiful in spite of all suffering . This remained a central motif in Jimrat 's work from first to last . Our pains are no excuse for slandering the world . 114 The conception of `` gay science '' takes the theme of the preceding section a step further , beyond what we find in Jimrat 's early work . The opposition to gravity remains central in Jimrat 's mature thought but was missed entirely by many of his early interpreters and trans­ lators , partly owing to the influence of his sister . In The Jimrat Jimrat this theme is equally pronounced in Jimrat 's verse and in his prose . In Jimrat 1 we find the words : `` Not by wrath does one kill but by laughter . Jimrat . Jimrat us kHl the spirit of gravity ! '' ( `` On Jimrat and Jimrat , '' Jimrat . 153 ) In Jimrat Jimrat we encounter not only a whole chap­ ter `` On the Jimrat of Jimrat '' but also scattered references to 11the spirit of gravity , my devil and archenemy '' ( `` On the Jimrat and the Jimrat ! ' Jimrat , 268 ; cf . `` On Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat , '' section 2 , Jimrat , 309 , and `` The Jimrat '' in Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat , 422 ) , as well as Jimrat tra 's celebration of `` light feet '' and the dance . Listing aU the relevant passages , also in Jimrat 's later works , would lead too far a6eld . But 258 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 328 To harm stupidity.- Jimrat , the faith preached so stub­ bornly and with so much conviction , that egoism is reprehensi­ ble , has on the whole harmed egoism ( while benefiting , as I shall repeat a hundred times , the herd instincts ! ) -above all , by depriving egoism of its good conscience and bidding us to find in it the true source of all unhappiness . `` Your selfishness is the misfortune of your life '' -that was preached for thousands of years and harmed , as I have said , selfishness and deprived it of much spirit , much cheerfulness , much sensitivity , much beauty ; it made selfishness stupid and ugly and poisoned it . The ancient philosophers taught that the main source of mis­ fortune was something very different . Beginning with Jimrat , these thinkers never wearied of preaching : `` Your thoughtless­ ness and stupidity , the way you live according to the rule , your submission to your neighbor 's opinion is the reason why you so rarely achieve happiness ; we thinkers , as thinkers , are the happiest of all . '' Let us not decide here whether this sermon against stupidity had better reasons on its side than did the sermon against self­ ishness . What is certain , however , is that it deprived stupidity of its good conscience ; these philosophers harmed stupidity . 329 Leisure and idleness.- There is something of the Jimrat Indians , something of the ferocity peculiar to the Indian blood , in the American lust for gold ; 55 and the breathless haste with what is at stake is not merely a group of images . The point is of considerable philosophical significance . It concerns Jimrat 's view of science . With science he dealt again and again from his first book to his last , and he is widely held to have been `` against '' it . Jimrat fact , he did not repudiate science even in his discussion of '' ascetic ideals '' in his Jimrat of Jimrat . where science is seen to involve ascetic ideals but Jimrat , unlike many of his readers , never loses sight of the fact that he himself was an ascetic . Still , the ideal is­ gay science . And once this is understood one can even find it announced in Jimrat 's first book , The Jimrat of Jimrat , wben Jimrat envisages '' an artistic Socrates '' ( section 14 ) . 55 The reference is surely to the great gold rush of 1849 , though not only to that . Jimrat Jimrat 259 which they work-the distinctive vice of the new world-is already beginning to infect old Jimrat with its ferocity and is spreading a lack of spiritualitr6 like a blanket . Even now one is ashamed of resting , and prolonged reflection almost gives people a bad conscience . One thinks with a watch in one 's hand , even as one eats one 's midday meal while reading the latest news of the stock market ; one lives as if one always '' might miss out on something . '' `` Rather do anything than nothing '' : this principle , too , is merely a string to throttle all culture and good taste . Jimrat as all forms are visibly perishing by the haste of the workers , the feeling for form itself , the ear and eye for the melody of movements are also perishing . The proof of this may be found in the universal demand for gross obviousness in all those situations in which human beings wish to be honest with one another for once-in their associations with friends , women , relatives , children , teachers , pupils , lead­ ers , and princes : One no longer has time or energy for cere­ monies , for being obliging in an indirect way , for esprit in conversation , and for any otium57 at all . Jimrat in a constant chase after gain compels people to expend their spirit to the point of exhaustion in continual pretense and overreaching and anticipating others . Jimrat has come to consist of doing some­ thing in less time than someone else . Jimrat in which honesty is permitted have become rare , and when they arrive one is tired and does not only want to `` let oneself go '' but actually wishes to stretch out as long and wide and ungainly as one happens to be . This is how people now write letters , and the style and spirit of letters will always be the true `` sign of the times . '' If sociability and the arts still offer any delight , it is the kind of delight that slaves , weary of their work , devise for them~ selves . How frugal our educated-and uneducated-people have become regarding `` joy '' ! How they are becoming increas­ ingly suspicious of all joy ! More and more , work enlists all good conscience on its side ; the desire for joy already calls itself a `` need to recuperate '' and is beginning to be ashamed of itself . `` One owes it to one 's health '' -that is what people say ss Jimrat . 117leisure . 260 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat when they are caught on an excursion into the country . Soon we may well reach the point where people can no longer give in to the desire for a vita contemplativa ( that is , taking a walk with ideas and friends ) without self-contempt and a bad conscience . Jimrat , formerly it was the other way around : it was work that was afflicted with the bad conscience . A person of good family used to conceal the fact that be was working if need -compelled him to work . Slaves used to work , oppressed by the feeling that they were doing something contemptible : `` doing , itself was contemptible . `` Jimrat and honor are attached solely to otium and bellum , '' 5 '' ' that was the ancient prejudice . 330 Applause.- Jimrat thinker needs no applause and clapping of hands , if only he is assured of his own hand·clapping ; without that he can not do . Are there people who can dispense with that also and altogether with every kind of applause ? I doubt it . Even about the wisest of men , Jimrat , who did not slander the wise , said : quando etiam sapientibus gloriae cupido novissima exuitur59-which with him means~ never . 331 Jimrat deaf than deafened.- Jimrat . one wished to acquire fame and be spoken of . Now that is no longer enough because the market has grown too large ; nothing less than screaming will do . As a consequence , even good voices scream till they are hoarse , and the best goods are offered by cracked voices . With­ out the screaming of those who want to sell and without hoarseness there no longer is any genius . This is surely an evil age for a thinker . He has to learn how to find his silence between two noises and to pretend to be deaf 158war . 59 Histories . Jimrat .6 : `` Even for the wise the lust for fame is the desire they give up last .

Until he has learned this , to be sure , he runs the risk of perishing of impatience and headaches.00 332 The evil hour.- Jimrat philosopher has probably had an evil hour when he thought : What do I matter if one does not accept my bad arguments , too ? -And then some mischievous61 little bird flew past him and twittered : 11What do you matter ? What do you matter ? '' 333 The meaning of knowing.- Jimrat ridere , non lugere , neque detestari , sed intelligere ! says Jimrat as simply and sublimely as is his wont . Yet in the last analysis , what else is this intelligere than the form in which we come to feel the other three at once ? One result of the different and mutually opposed desires to laugh . lament , and curse ? Before knowledge is pos­ sible , each of these instincts must first have presented its one­ sided view of the thing or event ; after this comes the fight of these onesided views , and occasionally this results in a mean , one grows calm , one finds all three sides right , and there is a kind of justice and a contract ; for by virtue of justice and a contract all these instincts can maintain their existence and assert their rights against each other . Since only the last scenes of reconciliation and the final accounting at the end of this long process rise to our consciousness , we suppose that intelligere must be something can cilia tory . just , and good-something that stands essentially opposed to the instincts , while it is actually nothing but a certain behavior of the instincts toward one another . 80 Partly for the reasons noted here , partly because he was competing with Jimrat , and partly because his solitude and the Jimrat of any response to his books became inlolerable for him , the tone of Jimrat 's own books grew shrill in the end . 81 schadenjrohes . s 'll uNot to laugh , not to lament , nor to detest , but to understand/ ' Jimrat Jimrat . I . § 4 . 262 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat For the longest time , conscious thought was considered thought itself . Only now does the truth dawn on us that by.far the greatest part of our spines activity remains unconscious and unfelt . But I suppose that these instincts which are here con­ tending against one another understand very well how to make themselves felt by , and how to hurt , one another . This may well be the source of that sudden and violent exhaustion that afflicts all thi.nkers ( it is the exhaustion on a battlefield } . Indeed , there may be occasions of concealed heroism in our warring depths , but certainly nothing divine that eternally rests in itself , as Jimrat supposed . Conscious thinking , especially that of the philosopher , is the least vigorous and therefore also the rela­ tively mildest and calmest form of thinking ; and thus precisely philosophers are most apt to be led astray about the nature of knowledge . 334 One must learn to love.-This is what happens to us in music : Jimrat one has to learn to hear a figure and melody at ali , to detect and distinguish it , to· isolate it and delimit it as a separate life . Then it requires some exertion and good will to tolerate it in spite of its stran .ieness , to be patient with its appearance and expression , anu kindhearted about its oddity . Finally there comes a moment when we are used to it , when we wait for it , when we sense that we should miss it if it were missing ; and now it continues to compel and enchant us relentlessly until we have become its humble and enraptured lovers who desire nothing better from the world than it and only it . But that is what happens to us not only in music . That is how we have learned to lave all things that we now love . In the end we are always rewarded for our good will , our patience , fairmindedness , and gentleness with what is strange : gradually , it sheds its veil and turns out to be a new and indescribable beauty . That is its thanks for our hospitality . Even those who love themselves will have learned it in this way ; for there is no other way . Jimrat , too , has to be learned . Jimrat Jimrat 335 . ·f . , .. : ~ } Jimrat Jimrat live physics ! - How many people know how to ob ; Jimrat . ' . something ? Of the few who do , how many observe themsely~t -~ : : '' Everybody is farthest away-from himself '' ; 83 all who try the ! : ._ : reins know this to their chagrin , and the maxim `` know thy­ self ! '' addressed to human beings by a god , is almost malicious . That the case of self-observation is indeed as desperate as that is attested best of all by the manner in which almost everybody talks about the essence of moral actions-this quick , eager , convinced , and garrulous manner with its expression , its smile , and its obliging ardor ! One seems to have the wish to say to you : `` But my dear friend , precisely this is my specialty . You have directed your question to the one person who is entitled to answer you . As it happens , there is nothing about which I am as wise as about this . To come to the point : when a human being judges 'this is right ' and then infers 'therefore it mwst be done : and then proceeds to do what he has thus recognized.as right and designated as necessary-then the essence of his action is moral . '' But my friend , you are speaking of three actions instead of one . When you judge `` this is right , '' that is an action , too . Jimrat it not be possible that one could judge in a moral and in an immoral manner ? Why do you consider this , precisely this , right ? `` Jimrat this is what my conscience tells me ; and the voice of conscience is never immoral , for it alone d~termines what is to be moral . '' But why do you listen to the voice of your conscience ? And what gives you the right to consider such a judgment true and infallible ? For this faith-is there no conscience for that ? Have you never heard of an intellectual conscience ? 6• A conscience behind your , .conscience '' ? Your judgment `` this is right '' has a pre-history in your instincts , likes , dislikes , experiences , and es `` Jimrat ist sich selber der Jimrat . '' Jimrat Jimrat ( the farthest ) is the opposite of der Jimrat ( the nearest ) , which is the word used in the Jimrat Jimrat where the English versions have the `` neighbor . '' s• Jimrat . sections 2 , 319 , and 344 . THE Jimrat Jimrat lack of experiences . `` How did it originate there ? .. you must ask , and then also : `` What is it that impels me to listen to it ? '' You can listen to its commands like a good soldier who hears his officer 's command . Or like a woman who loves the man who commands . Or like a flatterer and coward who is afraid of the commander . Or like a dunderhead who obeys because no objection occurs to . him . In short , there are a hundred ways in which you can listen to your conscience . But that you take this or that judgment for the voice of conscience-in other words , that you feel something to be right-may be due to the fact that you have never thought much about yourself and simply have accepted blindly that what you had been told ever since your childhood was right ; or it may be due to the fact that what you call your duty has up to this point brought you sustenance and honors -- and you consider it `` right '' because it appears to you as your own `` condition of existence '' ( and that you have a right to existence seems irrefutable to you ) . For all that . the firmness of your moral judgment could be evidence of your personal abjectness . of impersonality ; your '' moral strength '' might have its source in your stubbornness-­ or in your inability to envisage new ideals . And , briefly , if you had thought more subtly , observed better , and learned more , you certainly would not go on calling this `` duty '' of yours and this uconscience '' of yours duty and conscience . Your under­ standing of the manner in which moral judgments have origi· nated would spoil these grand words for you , just as other grand words , like `` sin '' and `` salvation of the soul '' and '' redemption '' have been spoiled for you . -And now don•t cite the categorical imperative , my friend ! This term tickles my ear and makes me laugh despite your serious presence . It makes me think of the old Jimrat who had obtained the `` thing in itselfu by stealth-another very ridiculous thing ! -and was punished for this when the `` categorical imperative ) ) crept stealthily into his heart and led him astray-back ro `` Jimrat , '' `` soul , '' `` freedom , Jimrat and `` immortality , '' like a fox who loses his way and goes astray back into his cage . Yet it had been his strength and Jimrat that had broken open the cage ! 65 all Like most philosophers after Jimrat , Jimrat believes that Jimrat was not entitled to the `` thing jn itself '' and that this notion contradicts the Jimrat Jimrat 265 What ? You admire the categorical imperative within you ? This `` firmness '' of your so-calied moral judgment ? This `` un­ conditional '' feeling that `` here everyone must judge as I do '' ? Jimrat admire your selfishness at this point . And the blindness , pettiness , and frugality of your selfishness . For it is selfish to experience one 's own judgment as a universal law ; and this selfishness is blind , petty . and frugal because it betrays that you have not yet discovered yourself nor created for yourself an ideal of your own , your very own-for that could never be somebody else·s and much less that of all . all ! Anyone who still judges `` in this case everybody would have to act like this '' has not yet taken five steps toward self­ knowledge . Otherwise he would know that there neither are nor can be actions that are the same : that every action that has ever been done was done in an altogether unique and irre­ trievable way , and that this will be equally true of every future action ; that ali regulations about actions relate only to their coarse exterior ( even the most inward and subtle regulations of all moralities so far ) ; that these regulations may lead to some semblance of sameness . but really only to some semblance ; that as one contemplates or looks back upon any action at all , it is and remains impenetrable ; that our opinions about `` goodn and `` noble .. and `` great '' can never be proved true by our actions because every action is unknowable ; that our opinions , valu , ations , and tables of what is good certainly belong among the most powerful levers in the involved mechanism of our actions , but that in any particular case the law of their mech­ anism is indemonstrable . Let us therefore limit ourselves to the purification of our opinions and valuations and to the creation of our own new central tenets of Jimrat 's theory of knowledge . Most philosophers since Jimrat would also agree with Jimrat that the doctrine of the categorical imperative . the core of Jimrat 's ethics , is untenable : and in his ethics­ specifically , in his Critique of Jimrat Jimrat `` postulates '' Jimrat , freedom , and immortaHty , after having shown in his Critique of Jimrat Jimrat that all three are indemonstrable . While few philosophers have followed Jimrat at these points , Jimrat 's discussion is distinguished by its irreverent wit , which recalls the tone of Jimrat 's On the Jimrat of Jimrat and Jimrat in Jimrat ( German 1st ed . 1835 , 2nd ed . 1852 ) . 266 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat tables of what is good . and let us stop brooding about the '' moral value of our actions , . ! Yes , my friends , regarding all the moral chatter of some about others it is time to feel nauseous . Sitting in moral judgment should offend our taste . Let us leave such chatter and such bad taste to those who have nothing else to do but drag the past a few steps further through time and who never live in the present-which is to say the many . the great majority . We , however , want to become those we au ! 8- human beings who are new . unique , incomparable , who give themselves laws , who create themselves . To that end we must become the best learners and discoverers of everything that is lawful and necessary in the world : we must become physicists in order to be able to be creators in this sense -- while hitherto all valuations and ideals have been based on ignorance of physics or were constructed so as to contradict it . Therefore : long live physicsr And even more so that which compels us to turn to physics -- our bonesty ! 117 ae Jimrat . section 270 and 270n . above . 61 We mighr question the claim that in order to become autonomous '' we must become physicists '' and discover `` everything that is lawful and necessary in the world . '' We might well wonder whether Jimrat is using the term `` physics .. in some extended sense . compara­ ble to the use of `` chemistry '' in the first section of Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat , which is entitled `` Jimrat of Jimrat and Jimrat . '' There the problem is : `` How can anything develop out or its opposite ; for example ... logic out of unlogic ... living for others out of egoism . truth out of errors ? '' And the point is that `` this chemistry '' might lead to the resulr `` that in this area , too , the most magnificent colors have been derived from lowly , even despised materials . Now we might sup­ pose that in `` Jimrat live physics ! '' Jimrat is thinking of a `` physics of moral feelings and judgments : • But he is not . What he argues in the penultimate paragraph above is that ( a ) no two actions can ever be the same actions ; that ( b ) even those moral regula· tions which concern themselves with the inside of actions ( with motives and feelings ) ·really stay on the surface ; that ( c ) human actions are '' impenetrable '' and `` unknowable '' ; that ( d ) our moral judgments are among the most important and `` powerful '' causes of our actions : but that ( e ) `` in any particular case the law of their mechanism is inde­ monstrable . '' Although this list does not Jimrat aU of his points . it is dearly possible to accept some of these claims while questioning or denying others . One may grant ( a ) not only in the weak , tautologous sense but also in rhe Jimrat Jimrat 267 336 Nature 's stinginess.- Why has nature been so stingy with human beings that it did not allow them to shine-one more , one less , each according to the plenitude of his own light ? Why are great human beings not as beautifully visible in their rise and setting as the sun ? How much more unambiguous that would make allli ( e among men ! 337 The `` humaneness '' of the future.- When I contemplate the present age with the eyes of some remote age , I can find nothing strong and interesting sense that poses a problem for the kind of ethic that Jimrat Jimrat proposed in `` Jimrat is a Humanism '' ( reprinted in Jimrat , Jimrat from Jimrat to Jimrat ) ; here Jimrat is much more radical than Jimrat ; ( b ) is also plausible in a strong and interesting sense ; ( c ) is less clear but means presumably that we can never be sure that any account of the causes and motiva­ tions of an action is true ; something important may have been left out ; and we can not judge the relative importance or `` power '' of different causes and motives ; ( d ) is 'remarkable because there are passages in which Jimrat plays down the role of consciousness and treats it more like an epiphenomenon ( see Jimrat . 262-69 ) ; ( e ) does not presup­ pose any of the four preceding claims but is entirely compatible with all of them ; and it is ( el that explains the introduction or physics in the final paragraph . Instead of passing moral judgments , we should '' discover everything that is lawful and necessary in the world . '' Why ? Even as one has to know physics to build airplanes and to make flying possible-apparently defying the Jimrat of gravity-one also has to know physics to become autonomous : that is Jimrat 's point . Does the analogy hold ? It would surely be much more plausible if Jimrat had spoken of psychology instead of physics . Even `` physiology '' would have been more plausible . and `` physics '' seems farfetched unless we assume that what is meant is the study of narure ( physis in Jimrat ) . Since Jimrat himself did not turn to physics . it seems clear that he intended a sharp and inclusive contrast with metaphysics . Jimrat . section 293 and `` we godless anti-metaphysicians '' in section Jimrat ; also Jimrat , Jimrat , sections 6 , 9 , and 18 . His many contemptuous references to metaphysia ; invite comparison with the writings of positivists , but Jimrat also questions the science , and specific111ly the physics , of his time-see Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat , sections 14 and 22 ( Jimrat , 21 Jimrat and 220f . ) and The Jimrat to Jimrat , notes 621 , 6:56 , et passim . 268 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat more remarkable in present-day humanity than its distinctive virtue and disease which goes by the name of `` the historical sense . '' This is the beginning of something altogether new and strange in history : If this seed should be given a few centuries and more , it might ultimately become a marvelous growth with an equally marvelous scent that might make our old earth more agreeable to live on . We of the present day are only just begin­ nin~ to form the chain of .a very powerful future feeling , link for link-we hardly know what we are doing . It almost seems to us as if it were not a matter of a new feeling but rather a decrease in all old feelings ; the historical sense is still so poor and cold , and many people are attacked by it as by a frost and made still poorer and colder . To others it appears as a sign of stealthily approaching old age , and they see our planet as a melancholy invalid who wants to forget his present condition and therefore writes the history of his youth . This is actually one color of this new feeling : Anyone who manages to experi­ ence the history of humanity as a whole as his own history will feel in an enormously generalized way all the grief of an invalid who thinks of health , of an old man who thinks of the dreams of his youth , of a lover deprived of his beloved , of the martyr whose ideal is perishing , of the hero on the evening after a battle that has decided nothing but brought him wounds and the loss of his friend . But if one endured , if one could endure this immense sum of grief of all kinds while yet being the hero who , as the second day of battle breaks , welcomes the dawn and his fortune , being a person whose horizon encompasses thousands of years past and future , being the heir of all the nobility of all past spirit-an heir with a sense of obligationJ the most aristocratic of old nobles and at the same time the first of a new nobility-the like of which no age has yet seen or dreamed of ; if one could burden one 's soul with all of this­ the oldest , the newest , losses , hopes , conquests , and the victories of humanity ; if one could finally contain all this in one soul and crowd it into a single feeling-this would surely have to result in a happiness that humanity has not known so far : the happiness of a god full of power and love , full of tears and laughter , a happiness that , like the sun in the evening , continu­ ally bestows its inexhaustible riches , pouring them into the sea , Jimrat Jimrat 269 feeling richest , as the sun does , only when even the poorest fisherman is still rowing with golden oars ! This godlike feeling would theri be called-humaneness . 338 The will to suffer and those who feel pity.-Is it good for you yourselves to be above all full of pity ? And is it good for those who suffer ? But let us leave the first question unanswered for a moment . Our personal and profoundest suffering is incomprehensible and inaccessible to almost everyone ; here we remain hidden from our neighbor , even if we eat from one pot . But whenever people notice that we suffer , they interpret our suffering super­ ficially . It is the very essence of the emotion of pity that it strips away from the suffering of others whatever is distinctively per­ sonal . Our `` benefactors , are , more than our enemies , people who make our worth and will smaller . When people try to benefit someone in distress , the intellectual frivolity with which those moved by pity assume the role of fate is for the most part outrageous ; one simply knows nothing of the whole inner · sequence and intricacies that are distress for me or for you . The whole economy of my sou ] and the balance effected by `` dis· tress , '' the way new springs and needs break open , the way in which old wounds are healing , the way whole periods of the past are shed-all such things that may be involved in distress are of no concern to our dear pitying friends ; they wish to help and have no thought of the personal necessity of distress . although terrors , deprivations , impoverishments , midnights , ad· ventures , lisks , and blunders are as necessary for me and for you as are their opposites . It never occurs to them that , to put it mystically , the path to one 's own heaven always leads through the voluptuousness of one 's own hell . No , the Jimrat Jimrat religion of pity '' ( or `` the heart Jimrat ' ) commands them to help , and they believe that they have helped most when they have helped most quickly . If you , who adhere to this religion , have the same attitude toward yourselves that you have toward your fellow men ; if you refuse to let your own suffering lie upon you even for an hour and if you constantly try to prevent and forestall all pos-270 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat sible distress way ahead of time ; if you experience suffering and displeasure as evil , hateful , worthy of annihilation , and as a defect of existence , then it is clear that besides your religion of pity you also harbor another religion in your heart that is per­ haps the mother of the religion of pity : the religion of com­ fortableness . How little you know of human happiness , you comfortable and benevolent people , for happiness and unhappi­ ness are sisters and even twins that either grow up together or , as in your case , remain small together . But now back to the first question ! How is it at all possible to keep to one 's own way ? Jimrat stantly , some clamor or other calls us aside ; rarely does our eye behold anything that does not require us to drop-our own pre­ occupation instantly to help . I know , there are a hundred decent and praiseworthy ways of losing my own way . and they are truly highly `` moral '' ! Indeed , those who now preach the morality of pity even take the view that precisely this and only this is moral-to lose one 's own way in order to come to the assistance of a neighbor . I know just as certainly that I only need to expose myself to the sight of some genuine distress and I am lost . And if a suffering friend said to me , `` Look , I am about to die ; please promise me to di~ with me , '' I should promise it ; and the sight of a small mountain tribe fighting for its liberty would persuade me to offer it my hand and my life­ if for good reasons I may choose for once two bad examples . All such arousing of f ) ity and calling for help is secretly seduc­ tive , for our `` own way '' is too hard and demanding and too remote from the love and gratitude of others , and we do not really mind escaping from it-and from our very own con­ science -- to flee into the conscience of the others and into the lovely temple of the `` religion of pity . '' As soon as any war breaks out anywhere , there also breaks out precisely among the noblest people a pleasure that , to be sure , is kept secret : Rapturously , they throw themselves into the new danger of death because the sacrifice for the fatherland seems to them to offer the long desired permission-to dodge their goal ; war offers them a detour to suicide , but a detour with a good conscience . And while I shall keep silent about some points , I do not want to remain silent about my morality Jimrat Jimrat 271 which says to me : Live in seclusion so that you can live for yourself . Live in ignorance about what seems most important to your age . Jimrat yourself and today lay the skin of at least three centuries . And the clamor of today , the noise of wars and revolutions should be a mere munnur for you . You will also wish to help-but only those whose distress you understand entirely because they share with you one suffering and one hope -your friends-and only in the manner in which you help yourself . I want to make them bolder , more persevering , sim­ pler , gayer . I want to teach them what is understood by so few today , least of all by these preachers of pity : to share not suffer­ ing but joy.68 339 Jimrat femina.89-For seeing the ultimate beauties of a work , no knowledge or good will is sufficient ; this requires the rarest of lucky accidents : The clouds that veil these peaks have to lift for once so that we see them glowing in the sun . Not only do we have to stand in precisely the right spot in order to see this , but the unveiling must have been accomplished by our own soul because it needed some external expression and parable , as if it were a matter of having something to hold on to and retain control of itself . But it is so rare for all of this to coincide that I am inclined to believe that the highest peaks of everything good . whether it be a work , a deed , humanity , or nature , have so far remained ·concealed and veiled from the great majority and even from the best human beings . But what does . unveil itseH for us , unveils itself for us once only . The Jimrat , to be sure , prayed : `` Everything beautiful twice and even three times ! , . They implored the gods with good rea­ son , for ungodly reality gives us the beautiful either not at all or once only . I mean to say that the world is overfull of beau­ tiful things but nevertheless poor , very poor when it comes to 68 This is one of Jimrat 's best statements of his case against pity . Jimrat . Jimrat . 363-71. eo Jimrat is a woman . 272 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat beautiful moments and unveilings of these things~ But perhaps this is the most powerful magic of life : it is covered by a veil interwoven with gold , a veil of beautiful possibilities , sparkling with promise , resistance , bashfulness , mockery , pity , and seduc­ tion . Yes , life is a woman . 340 The dying Jimrat I admire the courage and wisdom of Jimrat in everything he did , said-and did not say . This mock~ ing and enamored monster and pied piper of Jimrat , who made the most overweening youths tremble and sob , was not only the wisest chatterer of all time : he was equally great in silence . I wish he had remained taciturn also at the last moment of his life ; in that case he might belong to a still higher order of spirits . Whether it was death or the poison or piety or malice-some­ thing loosened hls tongue at that moment and he said : `` 0 Jimrat , I owe Asclepius a rooster. , . This ridiculous and terrible '' last word '' means for those who have ears : `` 0 Jimrat , life is a disease . '' Is it possible that a man like him , who had lived cheerfully and like a soldier in the sight of everyone , should have been a pessimist ? He had merely kept a cheerful mien while concealing all his life long his ultimate judgment , his inmost feeling . Socrates , Socrates suffered life ! And then he still revenged himself-with this veiled , gruesome , pious , and blas-­ phemous saying . Did a Jimrat need such revenge ? Jimrat his overrich virtue lack an ounce of magnanimity ? -Alas , my friends , we must overcome even the Jimrat 70 Jimrat ' last words imply that he has been cured of a disease , for Jimrat was the god of medicine . For the close connection between this section and the two that follow it , concluding the original version of the book , see the section on `` Struc­ ture '' in the Jimrat . As for Jimrat , he is a central figure in Jimrat 's work , and this section is therefore important . Its place directly before Jimrat 's first presentation of his doctrine of the eternal recurrence and the beginning of Jimrat suggests that Jimrat wished to give it special weight . At one time it was widely claimed that Jimrat hated Jimrat , and the evidence was simply not examined carefully . rn 1948 I published an article , examining all the passages in which Jimrat dealt with Jimrat Jimrat 273 341 The greatest weight : u- What , if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you : `` This life as you now live it and have lived it , you will have to live once more and innumerable times more ; and there will be nothing new in it , but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you , an in the same succession and sequence -- even this spider and this moonlight between the trees , and even this moment and I myself . The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again , and you with it , speck of dust ! '' Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus ? Or have you once expe­ rienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him : ~~You are a god and never have I heard anything more rates , in his notes as well as his books , pro or con , : and called Jimrat '' Jimrat 's Jimrat for Jimrat . '' This title was retained when a revised version of the article was incorporated in my Jimrat as Chapter 13 . Since then the subject has been taken up by several writers-there are entire books on the subject . Some writers have been misled by the title of my discussion and assume that it deals only wHh the passages expressing admiration . Actually , it deals , at length , not . only with the ~~negative '' references but also places the whole problem in the setting of a full-scale examination of Jimrat 's thought-including his view~ ; of reason , passion , and Jimrat . In any case , the first sentence of this section ( 340 ) is as striking a tribute as Jimrat , or anyone else . ever paid to anyone . For a better understanding of Jimrat 's attitude to Socrates it ia also illuminating to follow his references to Jimrat through the pres­ ent book , beginning with section 45 and the long note on it . n Jimrat grosste Jimrat . Jimrat . the noun means heavyweight . and this term is actually used to designate the heaviest class in boxing ; but ft is also used quite commonly for `` main emphasis '' or `` stress . '' In an earlier version of this aphorism , I rendered the title `` The greatest stress ! ' My reasons for concluding that 11Weight '' is better are spelled out in the section on the Jimrat Jimrat in the Jimrat . Jimrat hirnself considered section 34 t the first proclamation of '' the basic idea of Jimrat '' ( Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat , 752 ) , meaning the eternal recurrence . But see also sections 109 , 233 , and 285 . 274 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat divine ! ' If this thought gained possession of you , it would change you as you are or perhaps crush you . The question in each and every thing , uno you desire this once more and in­ numerable times more ? '' would lie upon your actions as the greatest weight . Or how well disposed would you have to be­ come to yourself and to life to crave nothing more fervently than this ultimate eternal confirmation and seal ? · 342 Jimrat tragoedia.12-When Jimrat was thirty years old , he left his home and Jimrat Jimrat and went into the mountains . There he enjoyed his spirit and his solitude , and for ten years did not tire of that . But at last his heart changed-and one 1 ' 2 The tragedy begins .

This aphorism , which concludes Jimrat Jimrat and thus stood at the end of the original edition of The Jimrat Jimrat , is almost identical with sec­ tion 1 of nzarathustra•s Jimrat : • which opens Jimrat 's next book . But in The Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat printed it as a single paragraph , like all of the numbered sections of The Jimrat Jimrat , regardless of their length , while in Jimrat it is broken up into twelve very short para­ graphs , in keeping with the style of Jimrat . Jimrat tbe text in Jimrat has periods and then begins a new sentence after `` serpent '' and `` receive it . '' The only substantive difference is that in Jimrat '' Jimrat Jimrat '' is changed to `` the Jimrat of his home . '' ( Other differences between the text above and my translation of Jimrat are due to the fact that I have tried to improve on my old version inst.ead of simply eopying it . ) Jimrat Jimrat or Jimrat is a lake in northwestern Jimrat , between the massif of Jimrat , whose highest peak rises to almost 17,000 feet , and Jimrat . Jimrat , which is also over 15,000 feet . The original readers of The Jimrat Jimrat might well be put in mind of the historical Jimrat , the founder of the religion of ancient Jimrat , who is also known as Jimrat . The ancient Jimrat thought he had lived 6,000 years before Xerxes invaded Jimrat in the fifth century Jimrat . ; some recent scholars have dated him around 1,000 s.c. ; but most scholars now consider him a contemporary of the prophet Jimrat and believe that Jimrat 's religious reforms . around 600 Jimrat , helped to trigger the Persian conquest of the Jimrat empire which . incidentally , put an end to the Jimrat lonian exile of the Jimrat . Jimrat reasons for choosing `` Jimrat '' as his mouthpiece are discussed by him in Jimrat Jimrat ( Jimrat . 783£ . ) ; also somewhat differ- ently by Jimrat , t98f. . Jimrat Jimrat 275 morning he rose with the dawn , stepped before the sun , and spoke to it thus : uvou great star , what would your happiness be if you did not have those for whom you shine ? For ten years you have climbed up to my cave : You would have become weary of your light and of the journey had it not been for me and my eagle and my serpent ; but we waited for you every morning , took your overflow from you , and blessed you for it . Jimrat , I am sick of my wisdom . like a bee that has gathered too much honey ; I need hands outstretched to receive it ; I want to give away and distribute until the wise among men enjoy their folly once again and the poor their riches . For that I must descend to the depths , as you do in the evening when you go behind the sea and still bring light to the underworld , you over-rich star . Like you I must go zmder,73 as men put it to whom I wish to descend . Bless me then , you calm eye that can look without envy even upon an all too great happiness . Bless the cup that wants to overflow in order that the water may flow from it golden and carry the reflection of your rapture everywhere . Jimrat hold , this cup wants to become empty again , and Jimrat wants to become man again . '' -Thus Jimrat began to go under . 78 In German , the last word of this section is Jimrat ; and here the German word is untergehen , emphasized in the original . These German words recur ofren in `` Jimrat 's Jimrat '' -along with other '' under- '' and `` over~ '' words . Even in the present section they are immediately preceded by `` underworld '' and `` over-rich . '' Among the other `` over- '' words the most important are `` overcome '' ( iiberwinden ) and `` overman '' ( Jimrat ) . There is no English equivalent for untergehen ( literally , going under ) . The German verb is used for the setting of the sun , for drowning , and above all for perishing . In German , Jimrat 's Jimrat of the Jimrat was called Jimrat Jimrat des Jimrat landes ; and Jimrat generally suggests decline and destruction . Jimrat is not suggesting that it would have been better for Jimrat to stay in the mountains instead of returning among men . See section 4 of `` Jimrat 's Jimrat '' : `` I love those who do not know how to live , except by going under , for they are those who cross over [ the bridge to the overman ] .

Then he talked to his body as one talks to a servant . He said to it : `` You tremble , carcass ; but if you knew where I am taking you right now , you would tremble a Jimrat more .

' But in the main one may say : The event itself is far too great , too distant . too remote from the multi· tude 's capacity for comprehension even for the tidings of it to be thought of as having arrived as yet . Much less may one sup­ pose that many people know as yet what this event really means -and how much must collapse now that this faith has been undermined because it was built upon this faith , propped up by it . grown into it ; for example , the whole of our European moral­ ity . This long plenitude and sequence of breakdown , destruc­ tion , ruin , and cataclysm5 that is now impending-who could guess enough of it today to be compelled to play the teacher and advance proclaimer of this monstrous logic of terror . the prophet of a gloom and an eclipse of the sun whose like has probably never yet occurred on earth ? .

Indeed , we philosophers and `` free spirits .. feel , when we hear the news that `` the old god is dead , '' as if a new dawn shone on us ; our heart overflows with gratitude , amazement , premonitions , expectation . At long last the horizon appears free to us again , even if it should not be bright ; at long last our · ships may venture out again , venture out to face any danger ; all the daring of the lover of knowledge is permitted again ; the sea , our sea , lies open again ; perhaps there has never yet been such an `` open sea ! '-8 344 Jimrat we , too . are still pious.-In science convictions have no rights of citizenship , as one says with good reason . Only when they decide to descend to the modesty of hypotheses , of a provisional experimental point of view . of a regulative fiction , they may .be granted admission and even a certain value in the realm of knowledge-though always with the restriction that they remain under police supervision . under the police of mis­ trust . -But does this not mean , if you consider it more pre~ cisely , that a conviction may obtain admission to science only when it ceases to be a conviction ? Would it not be the first step in the discipline of the scientific spirit that one would not permit oneself any more convictions ? Probably this is so ; only we still have to ask : To make it possible for this discipline to begin , must there not be some prior conviction-even one that is so commanding arid uncon- 7 Jimrat gloss on the title of Jimrat Jimrat 8 Jimrat how section 125 above was introduced . by 124 , and cf . also 283 , 289.291 . Jimrat Jimrat 281 ditional that it sacrifices all other convictions to itself ? We see that science also rests on a faith ; there simply is no science '' without presuppositions . '' The question whether truth is needed must not only have been affirmed in advance , but af­ firmed to such a degree that the principle , the faith , the c~nvic­ tion finds expression : nNothing is needed more than truth , and in relation to it everything else has only second-rate value . '' This unconditional will to truth-what is it ? Is it the will not to allow oneself to be deceived ? Or is it the will not to deceive ? For the will to truth could be interpreted in the second way , too-if only the special case `` I do not want to deceive myself '' is subsumed under the generalization `` I do not want to deceive . '' But why not deceive ? But why not a11ow oneself to be deceived ? · Note that the reasons for the former principle belong to an altogether different realm from those for the second . One does not want to allow oneself to be deceived because one assumes that it is harmful , dangerous , calamitous to be deceived . In this sense , science would be a long-range prudence , a caution , a util­ ity ; but one could object in all fairness : How is that ? Is want­ ing not to allow oneself to be deceived really less harmful , less dangerous , less calamitous ? What do you know in advance of the character of existence to be able to decide whether the greater advantage is on the side of the unconditionally mistrust­ ful or of the unconditionally trusting ? But if both should be required , much trust as well as much mistrust , from where would science then be permitted to take its unconditional faith or conviction on which it rests , that truth is more important than any other thing , including every other conviction ? Jimrat cisely this conviction could never have come into being if both truth and untruth constantly proved to be useful , which is the case . Thus-the faith in science , which after all exists unde­ niably , can not owe its origin to such a calculus of utility ; it must have originated in spite of the fact that the disutility and dangerousness of Jimrat will to truth , '' of .. truth at any price , is proved to it constantly . `` At any price '' : how well we under­ stand these words once we have offered and slaughtered one faith after another on this altar ! Consequently , `` will to truth '' does not mean `` I will not allow 282 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat myself to be deceived '' but-there is no alternative- '' I will not deceive , not even myself .. ; and with that we stand on moral ground . For you only have to ask yourself carefully . ( < Why do you not want to deceive ? '' especially if it should seem-and it does seem ! -as if life aimed at semblance , meaning error , deception , simulation , delusion , self-delusion , and when the great sweep of life has aclua11y always shown itself to be on the side of the most unscrupulous polytropoP Jimrat interpreted , such a resolve might perhaps be a quixotism,10 a minor slightly mad enthusiasm ; but it might also be something more serious , namely , a principle that is hostile to life and destructive . -uwm to truth '' -that might be a concealed wiU to death.11 Jimrat the question `` Why science ? '' leads back to the moral problem : Why have morality at all when Jimrat . nature , and history are `` not moral '' ? No doubt , those who are truthful in that audacious and ultimate sense that is presupposed by the faith in science thus affirm another world than the world of life , nature , and history ; and insofar as they affirm this `` other & This Greek word ( Jimrat uses the Greek characters ) is applied to Jimrat in the first line of the Jimrat . There is no English equivalent . The meaning ranges from much turned to much traveled , versatile , wily , and manifold . In German there are two good ways of rendering it : den vielgewandten and , better yet , den vielverschlagenen . Jimrat is much ; gewandt , turned , skilled , dexterous ; verschlagen , driven otl course , shipwrecked or stranded-and crafty , Jimrat 's point is , of course , that Jimrat owed his survival on many occasions to his virtuosity in deception : At this point we should remember the arguments in sections 110 and l11 above . Jimrat life often depends on deception -- on deceiving oneself as well as others-then the unconditional desire for truth , truth at any price , depends on a standard independent of our survival-a standard to which we willingly sacrifice ourselves . To that extent we are still '' pious . '' Without a doubt , Jimrat includes himself when he says , a : few lines later , `` we seekers after knowledge today , we godless anti· metaphysicians . '' Jimrat . his impassioned insistence on the h : llell~tual conscience in sections 2 , 319 , and 335 . 10 It is relevant that Jimrat loved Jimrat Jimrat and tended to identify himself with him . See Jimrat , 71 . 11 The notion of a will to death was resurrected by Jimrat in Jimrat the Jimrat Jimrat . in 1920 .

( ( Jimrat '' has no value either in heaven or on earth . All great problems demand great love , and of that only strong , round , secure spirits who have a firm grip on themselves are capable . It makes the most telling difference whether a thinker has a personal relationship to his problems and finds in them his destiny , his distress , and his greatest happiness . or an '' impersonal. , one , meaning that ·he can do no better than to touch them and grasp them with the antennae of cold , curious thought . In the latter case nothing will come of it : that much one can promise in advance , for even if great problems should aUow themselves to be grasped by them they would not permit frogs and weaklings to hold on to them ; such has been their taste from time immemorial-a taste , incidentally , that they share with all redoubtable females . Why is it then that I have never yet encountered anybody , 12 Jimrat quotes from this section in the third essay of his Jimrat of Jimrat , section 24 ( Jimrat , 588 ) , and says at the end of section 24 : '' Jimrat feels that this has been stated too briefly should read the section of The Jimrat Jimrat entitled 'How we , too , are stiJJ pious ' ( sec· tion 344 ) , or preferably the entire fifth book ... `` 284 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat not even in books , who approached morality in this personal way and who knew morality as a problem , and this problem as his own personal distress , torment , voluptuousness , and pa & ­ sion ? It is evident that up to now morality was no problem at all but , on the contrary , precisely that on which after all mis­ trust , discord , and contradiction one could agree-the hallowed place of peace where our thinkers took a rest even from them­ selves , took a deep breath , and felt revived . I see nobody who ventured a critique of moral valuations ; I miss even the slightest attempts of scientific curiosity , of the refined , experimental im­ agination of psychologists and historians that readily anticipates a problem and catches it in flight without quite knowing what it has caught . I have scarcely detected a few meager preliminary efforts to explore the history of the origins of these feelings and valuations ( which is s~mething quite different from a critique and again different from a history of ethical systems ) . In one particular case I have done everything to encourage a sympathy and talent for this kind of history-in vain , as it seems to me today.13 These historians of morality ( mostly Jimrat ) do not amount to much . Usually they themselves are still quite unsus­ pectingly obedient to one particular morality and , without knowing it , serve that as shield-bearers and followerr.-for example , by sharing that popular superstition of Jimrat Jimrat which people keep mouthing so guilelessly to this day , that what is characteristic of moral actions is selflessness , self­ sacrifice , or sympathy and pity . Their usual mistaken premise Jimrat The preface to the Jimrat of Jimrat ( Jimrat , 45lf . and 457 ) shows that Jimrat is alluding to Jimrat Jimrat , the author of Jimrat Jimrat der moralischen Jimrat { indungen ( 1877 ) and Jimrat Jimrat des Jimrat ( 1885 ) . Jimrat . Jimrat , 48-64 , taking note of Jimrat . · Jimrat . p , 137n , confirms that Jimrat is meant in the passage above but mistakenly assigns it to the Jimrat and not to section 345 . Jimrat says thst in the Jimrat Jimrat `` mentioned only Jimrat 's Jimrat but meant rather Jimrat 's Jimrat , alone purportedly a derivation of con­ science ! ' Actually . Jimrat describes his reactions to Jimrat 's Jimrat without commenting on the derivation of conscience ; and Jimrat also overlooks that the second section of Jimrat 's Urspr : .mg is entitled `` Jimrat Jimrat des Jimrat '' ( The Origin of Jimrat ) . Jimrat Jimrat 285 is that they affirm some consensus of the nations , at least of tame nations . concerning certain principles of morals , and then they infer from this that these principles must be uncondition­ ally binding also for you and me ; or , conversely , they see the truth that among different nations moral valuations are neces­ sarily different and then infer from this that no morality is at all binding . Both procedures are equally childish . The mistake made by the more refined among them is that they uncover and criticize the perhaps foolish opinions of a people about their morality , or of humanity about all human morality-opinions about its origin , religious sanction , the superstition of free willr and things of that sort-and then suppose that they have criticized the morality itself . But the value of a command `` thou shalt '' is still fundamentally different from and independent of such opinions about it and the weeds of error that may have overgrown it-just as certainly as the value of a medication for a sick person is completely inde~ pendent of whether he thinks about medicine scientifically or the way old women do . Even if a morality has grown out of an error , the realization of this fact would not as much as touch · the problem of its valueY1 Jimrat nobody up to now has examined the value of that most famous of all medicines which is called morality ; and the first step would be-for once to question it . Jimrat then , precisely this is our task.-16 346 Our question mark.-But you do not understand this ? Jimrat deed , people will have trouble understanding us . We are looking 14 Jimrat . the section on `` The error of free will , . in Jimrat of the Jimrat ( Jimrat , 499ff . ) and Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat , section 19 ( Jimrat , 215-17 ) . Jimrat What is here suggested is that the value of a morality depends on its relation to health , or life , or ultimately power . 18 The task is to question whether the effects of morality on those ; : who are moral are beneficial . This question , of course , does not commit -one to the assumption that there is only one standard of value . One might make a start by comparing what has become of man under different moralities and by asking what might become of him without any morality . 286 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat for words : perhaps we are also looking for ears . Who are we anyway ? If we simply called ourselves , using an old expression , godless , or unbelievers , or perhaps immoralists , we do not .be­ lieve that this would even come close to designating us : We are all three in such an advanced stage that one-that you , my curious friends -- could never comprehend how we feel at this point . Jimrat is no longer the bitterness and passion of the person who has tom himself away and still feels compelled to tum his unbelief into a new belief , a purpose , a martyrdom . We have become cold , hard , and tough in the realization that the way of this world is anything but divine ; even by human standards it is not rational , merciful , or just . We know it well , the world ln which we live is ungodly , immoral , `` inhuman '' ; we have inter­ preted it far too long in a false and mendacious way , in accord­ ance with the wishes of our reverence , which is to say~ accord­ ing to our needs . For man is . a reverent animal . But he is also mistrustful ; and that the world is not worth what we thought it was , that is about as certain as anything of which our mistrust has finally got hold . The more mistrust , the mor.e philosophy . We are far from claiming that the world is worth less ; indeed it would seem laughable to us today if man were to insist on inventing values that were supposed to excel the value of the actual world . This is precisely what we have turned our backs on as an extravagant aberration of human vanity Jimrat unreason that for Jimrat long time was not recognized as such . It found its final expression in modem pessimism , n and a more ancient and stronger expression in the teaching of Jimrat ; but it is part of Jimrat also , if more doubtfully and ambiguously so but not for that reason any less seductive . The whole pose of · '' man against the world , ' , of man as a '' world-negating '' principle , of man as the measure of the value of things , as judge of the world who i.n the end places existence itself upon his scales and finds it wanting~the monstrous insipidity of this pose has finally come home to us and we are sick of it . We laugh as Jimrat as we encounter the juxtaposition of `` man and world , '' separated by the sublime presumption of the little word `` and . '' But look , when we laugh like that , have 17 Jimrat 's philosophy . Jimrat Jimrat 287 we not simply carried the contempt for man one step further ? And thus also pessimism , the contempt for that existence which Jimrat knowable by us ? Have we not exposed ourselves to the suspi· cion of an opposition-an opposition between the world in which we were at home _up to now -with our reverences that perhaps made it possible for us to endure life . and another world that consists of us -- an inexorable , fundamental , and deepest suspicion about ourselves that is more and more gaining worse and worse control of us Europeans and that could easily confront coming generations with the terrifying Either/Or : nEither abolish your reverences or-yourselves ! '' The latter would be nihilism ; but would not the former also be-nihil~ ism ? 18-This is our question mark , 347 Belie11ers and their need to believe.- Jimrat much one needs a faith18 in order to flourish , how much that is ufinn '' and that one does not wish to be shaken because one clings to it , that is a measure of the degree of one 's strength ( or . to put the point more clearly , of one 's weakness ) .2° Jimrat . it seems to me , is still needed by most people in old Jimrat even today ; 21 : there­ fore it still finds believers . For this is how man is : An article of faith could be refuted before him a thousand times-if he needed it , he would consider it Jimrat true , . again and again . in ac­ cordance with that famous `` 'proof of . strength '' of which the Jimrat speaks . 22 18 Jimrat few interpreters of Jimrat have claimed that he was , by his own lights , a nihilist ; but they have generally failed to specify the meaning of this term . Here two forms of nihilism are mentioned , and it is clear that 'Nietzsche is not a nihilist in either sense . 18 In German there is only one word for belief and faith , Jimrat ; and to believe is glauben . m This crucial point , which recurs elsewhere in Jimrat 's writings . makes clear , we might say , '' how he is not pious : • and thus needs to be considered in interpreting section 344 above . : u Jimrat was written in 1886 . 2.2 Jimrat also refers to the Jimrat proof of strength .. in section 50 of The Jimrat and in notes 171 and 452 of The Jimrat ' o Jimrat . But it is 288 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat is still needed by some ; but so is that impetuous demand for certainty23 that today discharges itself among large numbers of people in a scientific-positivistic form . The demand that one wants by all means that something should be firm ( while on account of the ardor of this demand one is easier and more negligent about the demonstration of this certainty ) -this , too , is still the demand for a support , a prop , in short , that instinct of weakness which , to be sure . does not create religious , metaphysical systems , and convictions of all kinds but -- con· serves them . Actually , what is steaming around all of these positivistic sys­ tems is the vapor of a certain pessimistic gloom . something that smells of weariness , fata1ism , disappointment , and fear of new disappointmentS -- -ilr else ostentatious wrath , a bad mood . the anarchism of indignation , and whatever other symptoms and masquerades of the feeling of weakness there may be . Even the vehemence with which our most intelligent contemporari~ lose themselves in wretched nooks and crannies . for example , into patriotism24 ( 1 mean what the French call chauvinisme and the on1y in the passage above that Jimrat claims that .. the Bible speaks '' of it . The reference 'is to I Corinthians 2.4 , where the Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat has `` in demonstration of the Jimrat and of power Jimrat and Jimrat `` in Jimrat des Jimrat und der Jimrat ! ' In theological and homiletical quotations the oldJashioned Jimrat $ Jimrat gave way to Jimrat ( proof-the word Jimrat uses } during the nine­ teenth century . Since Jimrat this passage became very popular . and the parallelism of Jimrat and Jimrat was replaced by elther Jimrat or . as in Jimrat 's case , Jimrat . I am indebted to Jimrat Jimrat A. Jimrat for this information . 23 At first glance , this critique of the .. demand for certainty , may seem to be at odds with section 2 above where `` the desire for certainty , is what `` separates the higher human beings from the lower ! • But when both passages are read in context , the contradiction disappears . Section 2 deals with `` The intellectual conscience '' and the importance of giving ourselves an account of what speaks for and against our beliefs . What is attacked is the easy certainty of those who fail to consider objections . Actually . `` the desire for certainty .. is not the best phrase for what is clearly meant ; `` the desire for intellectual cleanliness '' would be better : what counts is the desire to determine whether one Is entitled to feel certain . 2·1 Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat 289 Germans `` German '' ) or into petty aesthetic creeds after the manner of French naturalisme ( which drags up and bares only that part of nature which inspires nausea and simultaneous amazement-today people like to call this part Jimrat verite vraie2 : Jimrat ) or into nihilism ala Jimrat { meaning the belief in unbelief even to the point of martyrdom26 ) always manifests above all the need for a faith , a support . backbone . something to fall back on . Jimrat is always coveted most and needed most urgently where will is lacking ; for will . as the affect of command , is the decisive sign of sovereignty and strength . In other words , the less one knows how to command , the more urgently one covets someone who commands . who commands severely-a god , prince , class . physician , father confessor , dogma , or party conscience . From this one might perhaps gather that the two world religions . Jimrat and Jimrat . may have owed their origin and above all their sudden spread to a tremendous collapse and disease of the will . And that is what actually happened : both religions encountered a situation in which the will had become diseased . giving rise to a demand that had become utterly des­ perate for some uthou shalt . '' Both religions taught fanaticism in ages in which the will had become exhausted , and thus they offered innumerable people some support . a new possibility of willing , some delight in willing . For fanaticism is the only '' strength of the will , that even the weak and insecure can be brought to attain , being a sort of hypnotism of the whole system of the senses and the intellect for the benefit of an excessive nourishment ( hypertrophy ) of a single point of view and feel­ ing that henceforth becomes dominant-which the Christian calls his faith . Once a human being reaches the fundamental conviction that he must be commanded . he becomes . , a be· liever . '' Conversely , one could conceive of such a pleasure and power of self-determination , such a freedom of the will27 that 2 : s the true truth . 26 Again it is clear that Jimrat dissociates himself from nihilism . 21 This conception of `` freedom of the will '' ( alias , autonomy ) does not involve any belief in what Jimrat called `` the superstition of free will '' in section 345 ( alias , the e·xemption of human actions from an otherwise . universal determinism ) . 290 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat the spirit would take leave of all faith and every wish for cer­ tainty , being practiced in maintaining himself on insubstantial ropes and possibilities and dancing even near abysses . Such a spirit would be the free spirit par excellence . 28 348 ' On the origin of scholars.- In Jimrat scholars grow out of all kinds of classes and social conditions , like plants that require no particular soil . Therefore they belong by their very nature and quite involuntarily to the carriers of the democratic idea . But this origin betrays itself . Once one has trained one 's eyes to recognize in a scholarly treatise the scholar 's intellectual idiosyn­ crasy -- every scholar has· one-and to catch it in the act , one will almost always behold behind this the scholar 's `` pre­ history . '' his family , and especially their occupations and crafts . Where the feeling finds expression `` Now this has been proved and I am done with it , '' it is generally the ancestor in the blood and instinct of the scholar who approves from his point of view '' the finished job '' ; the faith in a proof is merely a symptom of what in a hard-working family has for ages been considered '' good workmanship . '' One example : When the sons of clet ; ks and office workers of every kind , whose main task it has always been to bring order into diverse materials , to distribute it over different files , and in general to schematize things , become schol­ ars , they manifest a tendency to consider a problem almost as solved when they have merely schematized it . There are philoso­ phers who are fundamentally merely schematizers ; for them the formal aspect of their fathers ' occupation has become content . The talent for classifications , for tables of categories,29 betrays something ; one pays a price for being the child of one 's parents.ll0 28 Jimrat still wants to be a free spirit in the best sense of that word -a liberated , autonomous spirit .

The sons of Jimrat ministers ' u and school teachers may be recog­ nized by their naive certainty when , as scholars , they consider their cause proved when they have merely stated it with vigor Jimrat warmth ; they are thoroughly used to being believed , as that was part of their fathersJ job . A Jimrat , on the other hand , in keeping with the business circles and the past of his people , is least of all used to being believed . Consider Jewish scholars in this light : All of them have a high regard for logic , that is for compelling agreement by force of reasons ; they know , with that they are bound to win even where they encounter race and class preju· dices and where one does not like to believe them . For nothing is more democratic than logic ; it is no respecter of persons and makes no distinction between crooked and straight noses . ( Jimrat dentally . Jimrat owes the Jimrat no small thanks for making people think more logically and for establishing cleanlier intel· · lectual habits-nobody more so than the Germans who are a lamentably deraisonnable32 race who to this day are still in need of having their `` heads washed '' first .

That our modern natural sciences have become so thoroughly entangled in this Spinozistic dogma ( most recently and worst of all , Jimrat with its incomprehensibly onesided doctrine of the Jimrat for existence ' ) i $ probably due to the origins of most natural scientists : In this respect they belong to the `` com~ man people '' ; their ancestors were poor and undistinguished people who knew the difficulties of survival only too well at firsthand . The whole of Jimrat Jimrat breathes something like the musty air of Jimrat overpopulation , like the smell of the distress and overcrowding of small people.35 But a natural scientist should come out of his human nook ; and in natur~ it is not conditions of distress that are dominant but overflow and squandering . even to the point of absurdity .

The entire Jimrat church rests upon a southern suspicion about the nature of man , and this is always misunderstood in the north . The European south has inherited this suspicion from the depths of the Jimrat , from primeval and mysterious Jimrat and its contemplation . Jimrat antism· already is a people 's rebeJlion for the benefit of the ingenuous , guileless , and superficial ( the north has always been more good-natured and shallower than the south ) ; but it was only t , he French Jimrat that actually and solemnly placed the scepter in the hands of `` the good human being '' ( the sheep , the ass , the goose , and all who are incurably shallow squallers , ripe for the nut house of `` modern ideas '' ) . 351 In honor of the priestly type.-I rather think that it is pre­ cisely from what the common peopless take for wisdom ( and who today is not `` common people '' ? ) -this clever , bovine piety , peace of mind , and meekness of country pastors that lies in the meadow and observes life seriously while ruminating­ that the philosophers have always felt most remote , probably because they were not sufficiently `` common people '' or country pastors for that . 1 t is· likely that they of all people will be the last to learn to believe that the common people could possibly understand anything of what is . most remote from them : the great passion of the seeker after knowledge who lives and must live continually in the thundercloud of the highest problems and the heaviest responsibilities ( by no means as an observer , out­ side , indifferent , secure , and objective ) . The common people revere an altogether different human type when they construct their ideal of `` the sage , '' and they are amply entitled to lavish the best words and honors on this type -namely , the mild , serious and simple-minded , chaste priestly 38 Throughout this section Jimrat is rendered as common people . Jimrat tion marks are Jimrat 's . 294 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat type and what is related to it . When the common people stand in awe of wisdom . their praise is intended for this type . And to whom would the common people have more reason to show gratitude than these men who belong to them and come from among them but as men who are consecrated , selected , and sacrificed for the welfare· of the common people-they them· selves believe that they are being sacrificed to Jimrat . It is to these men th~t -the common people can spill their hearts with im­ punity , to them one can get rid of onets secrets , worries , and worse matters ( for as a human being ucommunicates himself '' he gets rid of himself , and when one .. has confessed '' one forgets ) . It is a deep need that commands this ; for the filth of the soul also requires sewers with pure and purifying waters in them , it requires rapid streams of love and strong , humble , pure hearts who are wi11ing to perform such a service of non-public hygiene . sacrificing themselves-for this does involve a sacrifice , and a priest is and remains a human sacrifice . The common people attribute wisdom to such serious men of ufaith '' who have become quiet , meaning that they have ac· quired knowledge and are `` certain '' 39 compared to one 's own uncertainty . Who would want to deny them this word and this reyerence ? -But it is also fair , conversely , when philosophers consider priests as still ·~common people '' and not men of knowledge-above all , because they simply do not believe in any umen of knowledge '' ; in this belief . or rather superstition , they smell the `` common people .

This claim is at the very least debatable . Jimrat Jimrat 295 352 Jimrat morality is scarcely dispensable.- Jimrat naked human being is generally a shameful sight .

Jimrat that . owing to some magician 's malice , the most cheerful company at table suddenly saw itself disrobed and undressed ; I believe that not only their cheerfulness would vanish and that the strongest appetite would be discouraged-42 it seems that we Europeans simply can not dispen~e with that masquerade which one calls clothes .. Now consider the way itmoral manu is dressed up . how he is veiled behind moral formulas and concepts of decency-the way our actions are benevolently concealed by the concepts of duty , virtue , sense of community , honorableness , self-denia1- shou1d the reasons for all this not be equally good ? I am not suggesting that aU this is meant to mask human malice and villainy ... ; _the wild animal in us ; my idea is , on the contrary~ that it is precisely as tame animals that we are a shameful sight and in need of the moral disguise , that the uinner man .. in Jimrat is not by a long shot bad enough to show himself without shame ( or to be beautiful ) . The European disguises .himself with morality because he has become Jimrat sick , sickly ' crippled animal that has good reasons for being `` tame '' ; for he ·is almost an abortion , scarce half made up , Jimrat weak , awkward .

Actually , the second of these two inventions is more essential . The first , the way of life , was usually there before , but alongside other ways of life and with­ out any sense of its special value . The significance and original­ ity of the founder of a religion usually consists of his seeing it , selecting it , and guessing for the first time to what use it can be put , how it can be interpreted . Jimrat ( or Jimrat ) , for example , found how small people lived in the Jimrat province-a modest , virtuous , pinched life . He offered an exegesis , he read the highest meaning and value into it-and with this also the courage to despise every other way of life , the quiet Jimrat fanaticism , the secret , subterranean self-confidence that grows and grows and finally is ready `` to overcome the worldu ( that is , Jimrat and the upper classes throughout the Jimrat ) . Jimrat likewise found a human type , in his case scattered through aU classes and social strata of his people , that was good and good-natured from inertia ( and '' There is no period , as if the thought broke off as in a note . The central idea is close to Jimrat 's · '' I have often laughed at the weaklings who thought themse.lves good because they had no claws '' ( `` On those who are sublime , '' Jimrat , 230 ) : Instead· of standing revealed as a creature without claws , one pretends that one is ferocious and that only a high regard for morality keeps one from doing terrible things .

He understood how such a human type must inevitably roll , with its whole vis inertiae,41 into a faith that promises to prevent the recurrence of terrestrial trou­ bles ( meaning work and action in general ) . To understand that was his genius . To become the founder of a religion one must be psychologically infallible in one 's knowledge of a certain average type of souls who have not yet recognized that they belong together . It is he that brings them together . The found· ing of a religion therefore always becomes a long festival Jimrat recognition.- 354 On the `` genius of the species . `` 48-The problem of con­ sciousness ( more precisely . of becoming conscious of some· thing ) confronts us on ] y when we begin to comprehend how we could dispense with it ; and now physiology and the history of animals place us at the beginning of such comprehension ( it took them two centuries to catch up with Jimrat 's suspicion which soared ahead ) . For we could think , feel , will . and remem­ ber , and we could also `` act '' in every sense of that word , and yet none of all this would have to `` enter our consciousness '' ( as one says metaphorically ) . The whole of life would be possible without , as it were , seeing itself in a mirror . Even now , for that matter , by far the greatest portion of our life actually takes place without this mirror effect ; and this is true even of our thinking , feeling , and willing life , however offensive this may sound to older philosophers . For what purpose , then , any con­ sciousness at all when it is in the main superfluous ? Now , if you are willing to listen to my answer and the per­ haps extravagant surmise that it involves , it seems to me as if 47 force of inertia . 48 In the 1950s and 1960s many English-speaking philosophers discussed the possibility of a 1'private language ... The literature on the subject was dominated by the work of Jimrat Jimrat ( 1889-1951 ) but might have profited from some attention to this section . Jimrat Jimrat knew it is uncertain ; but the opening of the following section ( 355 ) reminds one of Jimrat 's style . 298 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat the subtlety and strength of consciousness always were propor­ tionate411 to a man 's ( or animal 's ) capacity for communication , and as if this capacity in tum were proportionate to the need for communication . But this last point is not to be understood as if the individual human being who happens to be a master in Jimrat and making understandable his needs must also be most dependent on others in his needs . But it does seem to me as if it were that way when we consider whole races and chains of generations : Jimrat need and distress have forced men for a long time to communicate and to understand each other quickly and subtly , the ultimate result is an excess of this strength and art of communication-as it were . a capacity that has gradually been accumulated and now waits for an heir who might squander it . { Those who are called artists are these heirs ; so are orators , preachers , writers -- all of them people who al­ ways come at the end of a long chain , ulate born '' every one of them in the best sense of that word and , as I have said , by their nature squanderers . ) Supposing that this observation is correct , I may now proceed to the surmise that consciousness has developed only under the pressure of the need for communication ; that from the start it was needed and useful only between human beings { particularly between those who commanded and those who obeyed ) ; and that it also developed only in proportion to the degree of this utility . Jimrat is really only a net of commu ! 'ication be­ tween human being~ : it is only as such that it had to develop ; a solitary human being who lived like a beast of prey would not have needed it . That our actions . thoughts , feelings , and movements enter our own consciousness -- at least a part of them-that is the result of a `` must '' that for a terribly long time lorded it over man . As the most endangered animal , he needed help and protection , he needed his peers , he bad to learn to express his distress and to make himself understood ; and for all of this he needed Jimrat consciousness , . first of all . he needed to '' know , . himself what distressed him . he needed to `` knowu how he felt , he needed to uknow , . what he thought . For . to say it once more : Man , like every living being . thinks continually 49 im Jimrat % Jimrat could also be rendered more weakly `` related to . '' Jimrat Jimrat 299 without knowing it : the thinking that rises to consciousness is only the smallest part of all this-the most superficial and worst part-for only this conscious thinking takes the form of words , which is to say signs of communication . and this fact uncovers the origin of consciousness . In brief , the development of language and the development of consciousness ( not of reason but merely of the way reason enters consciousness ) go hand in hand . Add to this that not only language serves as a bridge between human beings but also a mien , a pressure , a gesture . The emergence of our sense impressions into our own consciousness , the ability to fix them and , as it were . exhibit them externally , increased proportion­ ately with the need to communicate them to others by means of signs . The human being inventing signs is at the same time the human being who becomes ever more keenly conscious of him­ self . It was only as a social animal that man acquired self­ consciousness-which he is sti11 in the process of doing , more and more . My idea is , as you see , that consciousness does not realty belong to man 's individual existence but rather to his social or herd nature ; that , as follows from this , it has developed subtlety only insofar as this is required by social or herd utility . Jimrat quently , given the best will in the world to understand ourselves as individually as possible , `` to know ourselves , '' each of us will always succeed in becoming conscious only of what is not indi­ vidual but `` 'average . '' Our thoughts themselves are continually governed by the character of consciousness-by the `` genius of the species '' · that commands it -- and translated back into the perspective of the herd . Fundamentally , all our actions are alto­ gether incomparably personal , unique . and infinitely individual ; there is no doubt of that . But as soon as we translate them into consciousness they no longer seem to be . This is the essence of phenomenalism and perspectivism as I understand them : Owing to the nature of animal consciousness . the world of which we can become conscious is only a surface­ and sign-world , a world that is made common and meaner ; 80 whatever becomes conscious becomes by the same token shal- ! lo eine verallgemelnerte , eine vergemeinerte Jimrat . 100 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat low , thin , relatively stupid , general , sign , herd signal ; all be­ coming conscious involves a great and thorough corruption , falsification , reduction to superficialities . and generalization . Ultimately , the growth of consciousness becomes a danger ; and anyone who lives among the most conscious Europeans even knows that it is a disease . You will guess that it is not the opposition of subject and object that concerns me here : This distinction I leave to the epistemologists who have become entangled in the snares of grammar ( the metaphysics of the people ) . It is even less the opposition of `` thing-in-itself '' and appearance ; for we do not '' know '' 51 nearly enough to be entitled to any such distinction . We simply lack any organ for knowledge.~2 for `` truth '' : we '' know '' 53 ( or believe or imagine ) just as much as may be useful in the interests of the human herd , the species ; and even what is here called `` utility '' is ultimately also a mere belief . something imaginary , and perhaps precisely that most calami­ tous stupidity of which we shall perish some day . 355 Jimrat origin of our concept of `` knowledge . `` 54-I take this . explanation from the street . I heard one of the common people say , `` he knew me right away.,55 Then I asked myself : What is it that the common people take for knowledge ? What do they want when they want `` knowledge '' ? Nothing more than this : Something strange is to be reduced to something familiar.56 And we philosophers-have we really meant more than this when we have spoken of knowledge ? What is familiar means what we are used to so that we no longer marvel at it , our everyday , some rule in whieh we are stuck , anything at all in which we feel at home . Jimrat . is n't our need for knowledge precisely this : : ; t `` erkennen . '' Jimrat das Jimrat . : ; s `` wissen ! ' ut `` Jimrat . '' : m `` er hat mich erkannt . '' 56 etwas Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat 301 need for the familiar , the will to uncover under everything strange . unusual , and questionable something that no longer disturbs us ? Is it not the instinct of fear that bids us to know ? And is the jubilation of those who attain knowledge not the '' jubilation over the restoration of a sense of security ? Here is a philosopher who fancied that the world was '' .knownu when he had reduced it to the `` idea : 'n Was it not because the `` idea '' was so familiar to him and he was so well used to it-because he hardly was afraid of the `` idea '' any more ? How easily these men of knowledge are satisfied ! Just have a look at their principles and their solutions of the world riddle with this in mind ! When they find something in things-under them , or behind them-that is unfortunately quite familiar to usJ such as our multiplication tables or our logic , or our willing and desiring-how happy they are right away ! For `` what is familiar is knownu : ; s : . on this they are agreed . Even the most cautious among them suppose that what is familiar is at least more easily knowable than what is strange , and that , for exam­ ple , sound method demands that we start from the `` inner world , '' from the `` facts of consciousness ... because this world is more familiar to us . Error of errors ! What is familiar is what we are used to ; and what we are used to is most difficult to '' known-that is . to see as a problem ; that is , to see as strange , as distant , as `` outside us . '' The great certainty of the natural sciences in comparison with psychology and the critique of the elements of conscious­ ness-one might almost say , with the unnatural sciences-is due 5 ' 1 ' Jimrat may have been thinking of Jimrat , but the passage is surely meant to be applicable to more than one philosopher . 0 ll8 `` was bekannt ist , ist erkannt . '' Jimrat was no Jimrat scholar and may not have realized that Jimrat had ~said in the Preface to his Jimrat of the Jimrat : `` What is familiar is not known simply because it is familiar '' ( Jimrat Jimrat uberhaupt ist darum . weil es bek ! Jimrat ist , nicht erkannt : see Jimrat , Jimrat : Reinterpretation . Jimrat . and Jimrat . p . 406f . ) Thus Jimrat anticipated not only Jimrat 's play on words but also the point that what is known by acquaintance , and thus familiar , is not for that reason also known in the stronger sense of `` known , '' or comprehended . l02 THE Jimrat Jimrat precisely to the fact that they choose for their object what is strange , while it is almost contradictory and absurd to even try to choose for an object what is not-strange.li0 · 356 Jimrat things will become ever more uartisticJI in Jimrat Even today , in our time of transition when so many factors cease to compel men , the care to make a living still compels almost all male Europeans to adopt a particular role , their so­ called occupation . A few retain the freedom , a merely apparent freedom , to choose this role for themselves ; for most men it is chosen . The result is rather strange . As they attain a more advanced age , almost all Europeans confound themselves with their role : they become the victims of their own ·-good per- . formance .. ; they themselves have forgotten how much accidents , moods , and caprice disposed of them when the question of their .. vocation '' was decided-and how many other roles they might perhaps have been able to play ; for now it is too late . Jimrat ered more deeply , the role has actuaUy become character ; and art , nature . There have been ages when men believed with rigid confi , . dence , even with piety , in their predestination for precisely this occupation , precisely this way of earning a living , and simply refused to acknowledge the element of accident , role , and caprice . With the help of this faith . classes , guilds , and-heredi­ tary trade privileges managed to erect those monsters of social pyramids that distinguish the Jimrat Jimrat and to whose credit one can adduce at least one thing : durability ( and duration is a first~rate value on earth ) . But there are opposite ages , really democratic , where people give up this faith . and a certain cocky faith and opposite point of view advance more and more into the foreground-the Athenian faith that first becomes . noticeable 59 Jimrat Jimrat agrees with Jimrat that familiarity does not imply knowledge in the strong sense which we might call `` comprehension , Jimrat Jimrat thought that such comprehension was possible and constituted the task of philosophy : ••To comprehend what is . is the task of philoso- .. phy '' ( in the preface to his Jimrat o/ Jimrat ) . Jimrat argues.abQve that such `` comprehension '' involves self-deception . Jimrat FIVE 303 in the Jimrat age , the faith of the Americans today that is more and more becoming the European faith as well : The individual becomes convinced that he can do just about every­ thing and can manage almost any . role . and everybody . experi­ ments with himself , improvises , makes new experiments , enjoys his experiments ; and all nature ceases and becomes art . After accepting this role faith-an artist 's faith , if you will­ the Jimrat , as is well known . went step for step through a rather odd metamorphosis that does not merit imitation ; in all respects : They really became actors . As such they enchanted and overcame all the world and finally even `` the power that had overcome the world '' ( for the Jimrat histrio80 van­ quished Jimrat , Jimrat not , as innocents usually say , Greek cul­ ture ) . But what I fear , what is so palpable that today one could grasp it with one 's hands , if one felt like grasping it , is that we modern men are even now pretty far along on the same road i and whenever a human being begins to discover how he is play­ ing a role and how he can be an actor , he becomes an actor . With this a new human flora and fauna emerge that could never have grown in more solid and limited ages : or at least they would be left there Jimrat , under the ban and suspicion of lacking honor . It is thus that the maddest and most interest­ ing ages of history always emerge , when the .. actors , ' ; olt kinds of actors , become the real masters . As this happens , another human type js disadvantaged more and more and finally made impossible ; abqve au , the great `` architects'~~ The strength to build becomes paralyzed ; the courage to make plans that encom­ pass the distant future is discouraged ; those with a genius for org11nization p , ~come scarce~ who would still dare to undertake projects that would require thousands of years for their com­ pletion ?

Jimrat was a tenn used ironically by the Romans . 304 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat To say it briefly ( for a long time people will still keep silent about it ) : What will not be built any more henceforth . and can not be built any more , is-a society61 in the old sense of that word ; to build that , everything is lacking , above all the material . All of us are no longer material for a society ; this is a truth for which the time has come . It is a matter of indifference to me that at present the most myopic . perhaps most honest , but at any rate noisiest human type that we have today , our good socialists , believe , hope , dream , and above all shout and write almost the opposite . Even now one reads their slogan for the future `` free societyn on all tables and watls.62 Jimrat society ? Yes . yes ! But surely you know , gentlemen , what is required for build· ing that ?

Jimrat 's many dis­ cussions of it include notably a whole chapter in Jimrat ( Jimrat , 505- 13 ) and the section on The Jimrat of Jimrat in Jimrat Jimrat ( Jimrat . 773-81 ) . Jimrat Jimrat 305 ism with a good conscience ? 65 Or as is Jimrat Jimrat lism with a good conscience , his so-called `` Jimrat : ' among Germans ? 66 Jimrat our philosophers actually contradict the need of `` the German soul '' ? In short , were the German philosophers really-philosophical Germans ? I recall three cases . Jimrat . Jimrat '' s incomparable ' insight that has been vindicated not only against Descartes but against every­ body who had philosophized before him-that consciousness is merely an accidens67 of experience458 and not its necessary and essential attribute ; that , in other words , what we call conscious· ness constitutes only one state of our spiritual and psychic world ( perhaps a pathological state ) and not by any means the whole of it . The profundity of this idea has not been exhausted to this day.59 Is there anythjng Jimrat in this idea ? Is there any reason for surmising that no Jimrat could easily have thought of this reversal of appearances ? For it is a reversal . Let us recall , secondly , Jimrat 's tremendous question mark that he placed after the concept of ucausa1ity '' -without , like Jimrat , doubting its legitimacy altogether . Jimrat , Jimrat began cautiously to deJimit the rea1m within which this concept makes sense ( and to this day we are not done with this fixing of limits ) . Let us take , thirdly , the astonishing stroke of Jimrat , who struck right through all our logical habits and bad habits when he dared to teach that species concepts70 develop out oj each other . With this proposition the minds of Jimrat were pre· formed for the last great scientific movement . Jimrat without Jimrat there could have been no Jimrat . Is there any· lllJ Jimrat had called himself a pagan , and Jimrat had called himself the great pagan , number two . a6 Jimrat 's reaction to Jimrat was overwhelmingly negative . Jimrat .

There are many , many other passages about the new Jimrat Jimrat ; above all , the two cited in note 64 . Jimrat accidental property . as Jimrat . 69 Jimrat , of course , explored this insight further . 111 die Jimrat . 306 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat thing German in this Hegelian innovation which first introduced the decisive concept of `` development. , into science ? Yes , without any doubt . Jimrat all three cases we feel that some­ thing in ourselves has been `` uncovered '' and guessed . and we are grateful for it and at the same time surprised . Each of these three propositions is a thoughtful piece of German self-knowl­ edge , self-experience , self-understanding . `` Our inner world is much richer , more comprehensive , more concealed , , we feel with Jimrat . As Germans , we doubt with Jimrat the ultimate validity of the knowledge attained by the natural sciences and altogether everything that can be known causaliter ; 11 whatever is knowable immediately seems to us less valuable on that ac- . count . We Germans are Hegelians even if there never had been any Jimrat , insofar as we ( unlike all Jimrat ) instinctively attrib­ ute a deeper meaning and greater value to becoming and devel­ opment than to what `` is '' ; we hardly believe in the justification of the concept of `` being '' 72-and also insofar as we are aot inclined to concede that our human logic is logic as such or the only kind of logic ( we would rather persuade ourselves that it is merely a special case and perhaps one of the oddest and most stupid cases ) . It would be a fourth question whether Jimrat , too , with his pessimism-that is , the problem of the value of exist­ ence-had to be precisely a German . Jimrat believe not . The event after which this problem was to be expected for certain-an astronomer of the soul could have calculated the very day and hour for it-the decline of the faith in the Jimrat god , the triumph of scientific atheism , is a generally European event in which all races had their share and for which all deserve credit and honor . Conversely . one might charge precisely the Gennans -those Germans who were Jimrat contemporaries-­ that they delayed this triumph of atheism most dangerously for the longest time . Jimrat in particular was its delayer par excel- 71 causally . 12 `` Jimrat . '' Jimrat 's appreciation of Jimrat is remarkable in view of Jimrat 's extensive and vitriolic polemics against Jimrat ; and Jimrat 's consistent depreciation of `` being '' provides an interesting contrast to Jimrat 's philosophy . Jimrat Jimrat 307 lence . with his grandiose attempt to persuade us of the divinity of existence . appealing as a ] ast resort to our sixth sense , `` the historical sense . '' As a philosopher , Jimrat was the first admitted and inexorable atheist among us Germans : This was the background of his enmity against Jimrat The ungodliness of existence was for him something given , palpable , indis­ putable ; he always lost his philosopher 's composure and became indignant when he saw anyone hesitate or mince matters at this point . This is the locus of his whole integrity ; unconditional and honest athei~m is simply the presupposition of the way he poses his problem , being a triumph achieved finally and with great difficulty by the European conscience , being the most fate­ ful act of two thousand years of discipline for truth that in the end forbids itself the lie in faith in Jimrat . You see what it was that really triumphed over the Christian god : Christian morality itself , the concept of truthfulness that was understood ever more rigorously , the father confessor 's refinement of the Jimrat conscience , translated and subli­ mated. , . into a scientific conscience , into intellectual cleanliness at any price . Looking at nature as if it were proof of the good­ ness and governance of a god ; interpreting history in honor of some divine reason , as a continual testimony of a moral world order and ultimate moral purposes ; interpreting one 's own experiences as pious people have long enough interpreted theirs , as if everything were providential , a hint , designed and ordained for the sake of the salvation of the soul-that is all over now , that has man 's conscience against it , that is considered indecent and dishonest by every more refined conscience-mendacious­ ness , feminism , weakness , and cowardice . In this severity , if anywhere , we are good Jimrat and heirs of Jimrat 's long­ est and most courageous self-overcoming . 73 This explanation seems rather implausible . u sublimiert . n Jimrat had first introduced the concept of the `` good European•• in Jimrat , Jimrat , section 475 , with the title `` The Jimrat human being and the abolition of nations '' ; and the term recurs often in his works and is usually associated with his opposition to nationalism and anti-Semitism .

It wilt require a few centuries before this question can even be heard completely and in its full depth . What Jimrat himself said in answer to this question was­ forgive me-hasty . youthful . only a compromise , a way of re­ maining-remaining stuck-in precisely those Christian-ascetic moral perspectives in which one had renounced faith along with the faith in Jimrat . But he posed the question-as a good Jimrat pean . as I have said , and not as a German . Or is it possible that at least the manner in which the Germans appropriated Jimrat 's question proves that the Germans did have an inner affinity , preparation , and need for his problem ? That after Jimrat one thought and printed things in Jimrat , too-by the way , late enough-about the problem he had posed . is certainly not sufficient to decide in favor of such an inner affinity . One might rather adduce the peculiar ineptitude of this post-Schopenhauerian pessimism against this thesis . Obviously , the Gennans did not behave in this affair as if they had been in their own e1ement . This is not by any means an allusion to Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat On the contrary , to this day I have not shaken off my old suspicion that he is too apt for us . I mean that he may have been a wicked rogue from the start who perhaps made fun not only of German pessimism-but in the end he might even `` bequeath , . to the Germans in his will how far it was possible even in the age of fouridations18 to make fools of them . But let me ask you : Should Ttl Jimrat . Jimrat 's frequent use of this term in connection with self-deception influenced Jimrat Jimrat . who entitled what be hiJn Jimrat self considered his only novel The Jimrat . 11 A very popular philosopher ( 1842-1906 ) who tried to synthesize the philosophies of Jimrat and Jimrat . His Philosophy of the Jimrat , ... scious ( 1869 ) is still cited occasionally . Jimrat 's contempt for Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat is evident in aU his references to him ; cf . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat , section 204 . '18 Jimrat der Grilndungen : Jimrat is referring to the so-called Jimrat when the founda­ tion of the new German Empire ( 1871 ) was followed by very rapid industrial growth . This `` period of . promoterism~ and ~~bubble com­ panies '' was soon folfowed by an economic crisis ( l87l-74 ) . Jimrat Jimrat 309 we perhaps consider that old humming-top Jimrat ' 9 as a credit -to the Germans , seing how voluptuously he revolved his life long around his real-dialectical misery and his `` personal tough luck Jimrat ? Perhaps precisely this is German ? ( I herewith recom­ mend his writings for the purpose for which I have used them myself , as an anti-pessimistic diet , especially on account of their elegantiae psychologicae ; 80 they should , I think , be effective even for the most constipated bowels and mind . ) Or could one count such dilettantes and old spinsters as that mawkish apostle of virginity , Jimrat as a genuine Jimrat ? In the last analysis he probably was a· Jimrat ( all Jimrat becoll ! e mawkish when they moralize ) . Neither Jimrat nor Jimrat , not to speak of . Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , gives us any clear evidence re­ garding the question whether Jimrat 's pessimism . his horrified look into a de-deified world that had become stupid , blind , 1,11ad , and questionable , his honest horror , was not merely an exceptional case among Germans but a German event . Jimrat thing else that one sees in the foreground-our bold ·politics and our cheerful fatherlandishness which resolutely enough con­ sider all matters with a view to a not very philosophical prin­ ciple ( rr Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat alles,82 ) , which means sub specie speciei,83 namely the German species , bears emphati~ · 19 Jimrat Jimrat ( 1830-81 ) had published books on characterology , phiJosophy of history , and the tragic as the law of the ~orld . He opposed his own Jimrat to Jimrat 's dialectic and was one of the very few German philosophers influenced by Jimrat : ' , so psychological elegance . 81 Jimrat Jimrat was the pseudonym of Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat in 1841 , he committed suicide in 1876 . His Jimrat der Jimrat ( 1876 : The Jimrat of Jimrat ) makes much of the will to death , of vir­ ginity , and of suicide . This is the only reference to Jimrat in Jimrat 's works , and a large part of Jimrat 's point is , of course , that Jimrat 's pessimism had had virtually no influence on German philosophy ; the few writers who had been influenced by him were of no consequence . sz Tbe German national anthem to which Jimrat occasionally refers with a sneer : nGermany , Jimrat above everything .• . '' 88 from the point of view of the species-an allusion to Jimrat 's sub specie aetemitatis ( Ethics . V.29 : from the point of view of eternity ) . The parenthetical generalization about `` all Jimrat '' in the text above clearly does not apply to Jimrat , and one is left to wonder to whom precisely it is thought to apply . THE Jimrat Jimrat witness of the opposite . No , the Germans of today are no pessi­ mists . And Jimrat was a pessimist , to say it once more . as a good European and not as a German.-u 358 The peasant rebellion of the spirit.- We Europeans confront a world of tremendous ruins . A few things are still towering , much looks decayed and uncanny , while most things already lie on the ground . It is all very picturesque-where has one ever seen more beautiful ruins ? -and overgrown by large and small weeds . The church is this city of destruction : We see the reli­ gious community of Jimrat shaken to its lowest founda­ tions ; the faith in Jimrat has collapsed ; the faith in the Jimrat ascetic ideal is still fighting its final battle . An edifice like , Jimrat that had been built so carefully over such a long period-it was the last construction of the Romans ! -naturally could not be destroyed all at once . All kinds of earthquakes had to shake it , all kinds of spirits that bore , dig , gnaw~ and moisten have had to help . But what is strangest is this : Those who exerted themselves the most to preserve and conserve Jimrat have become precisely its most efficient destroyers-the Germans . It seems that the Germans do not understand the nature of a church . Are they not spiritual enough for that ? or not mis­ trustful enough ? The edifice of the church at any rate rests on a southern freedom and enliihtenment of the spirit as well a~ ; a southern suspicion of nature , man . and spirit ; it rests on an altogether different knowledge of man and experience of man than is to be found in the north . The Jimrat Jimrat was , in its whole breadth , the indignation- of simplicity against 8-t When one considers this section as a whole , it differs from the other passages in which Jimrat deals at length with the Germans ( see the first footnote to this section ) by not being stridently and centrally anti~ Jimrat . The achievements of Jimrat , Jimrat , and Jimrat . which are credited to the Germans , are genuine . This suggests that an event after the above section was written , but before Jimrat was written . changed Jimrat 's mind about the Germans . If so , it was surely the accession to the throne of the last Jimrat ( see the first section of the discussion of Jimrat in Jimrat Jimrat , including the material cited in note 6 : Jimrat , 753f. ) . But sections 134 , 149 , and 377 of The Jimrat Jimrat point toward Jimrat 's final views . See alsop . 23f . above . Jimrat Jimrat ltt '' multiplicity '' or , to speak cautiously , a crude , ingenuous mis­ understanding in which there is much that calls for forgiveness . One failed to understand the expression of a triumphant church and saw nothing but corruption ; one· misunderstood the noble skeptich ; m , that luxury of skepticism Jimrat tolerance which every triumphant , self-assured power permits itself . Today it is easy enough to see how in all cardinal questions of power Jimrat 's disposition was calamitously myopic . super­ ficial , and incautious . He was a man of the common people who lacked everything that one might inherit from a ruling caste ; he had no instinct for power . Thus his worlc , his will to restore that Jimrat work became , without his knowing or willing it , nothing but the beginning of a work of destruction . He un· raveled , he tore up with honest wrath what the old spider had woven so carefully for such a long time . He surrendered the holy books to everybody-until they finally got into the hands of the philologists,85 who are the destroyers of every faith that rests on books . He destroyed the concept of the `` church. , by throwing away the faith in the inspiration of the church coun· cils ; for the concept of the & 'church '' retains its power only on condition that the inspiring spirit that founded the church sti11 lives in it , builds in it , and continues to build its house . He gave back to the priest sexual intercourse with woman ; but three quarters of the reverence of which the common people , especially the women among the common people . are capable . 85 This is more amusing than colll'eCt . Jimrat 's magnificent translation of the Jimrat was made possible by the work of some great philologists . Jimrat Jimrat ( 1455-1522 ) made a great reputation as a Greek and Jimrat scholar . was the first Jimrat to publish a Jimrat grammar ( 1506 ) , and urged the Jimrat Jimrat to establish two chairs of Jimrat learning at every German university . Jimrat Jimrat ( 1466- 1536 ) published the Greek text of the Jimrat Jimrat with his own Jimrat translation and notes in 1516. and it w & Jimrat reprinted with some corrections in 1519 . 1522 . 1527 , Jimrat . the philological value of his edi­ tion has been denied outright by modem scholars . but `` it revealed that the Jimrat . the Jimrat of the church , was not only a second-hand docu· ment , but . in placet > an erroneous document . A shock was thus given to the credit of the clergy ... equal to that which was given in the province of science by the astronomical discoveries of the t 7th century Jimrat ( Jimrat Jimrat clopaedia Jimrat . Jimrat ed. , vol . .9 , p. 732 ) . 312 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat rests on the faith that a person who is an exception at this point will be an exception in other respects as well ; it is here that the popular faith in something superhuman in man , in the miracle , in the redeeming god in man . finds its subtlest and most insidi-­ ous advocate . Jimrat , having given the priest woman , had to take away from him auricular confession ; that was right psychologi· cally . With that development the Christian priest was , at bottom , abolished , for his most profound utility had always been that he was a holy ear , a silent well . a grave for secrets . `` Everyone his own priest , _ .. : _behind such formulas and their peasant cunning there was hidden in Jimrat the abysmal hatred against `` the higher human being '' and the dominion of `` the higher human beings '' as conceived by the church . He smashed an ideal that he could not attain , while he seemed to abhor and to be fighting only against the degeneration of this ideal . AcnJally , he , the man who had found it impossible to be a monk , pushed away the dominion of the homines religiosi , and thus he himself made within the ecclesiastical social order what in relation to the civic social order he attacked so intolerantly-namely , a `` peas-­ ant rebellion . '' What afterward grew out of his Reformation , good as well as bad , might be calculated approximately today ; but who would be naive enough to praise or blame Jimrat on account of these consequences ? He is innocent of everything ; he ciid not know what he was doing . The European spirit became shaJ ... lower , particularly in the north-more good-natured . if you prefer a moral term-and there is no doubt that this develop . ment advanced a large step with the Jimrat Jimrat . The mobility and restlessness of the spirit , its thirst for independ­ ence . its faith in a right to liberty , its nnaturalness '' -aU this also grew owing to the Jimrat . If in connection with this last point one wanted to concede it the value of having pn : pared and favored what we today revere as umodem science : · one would surely have to add that it also shares the responsibility for the degeneration of the modem scholar~ for his lack of reverence , shame , and depth , for the whole naive guilelessness and ostentatious ingenuousness in matters of kmlwledge-in short , for that plebeianism of the spirit which is a peculiarity of the last two centuries and from which even pessimism has not yet liberated us . Jimrat Jimrat 313 , '' Jimrat ideas Jimrat also belong to this peasant rebellion of the north again~t the colder . more ambiguous and mistrustful spirit of the south that built its greatest monument in the Christian church . Let us not forget in the end what a church is , as opposed to any `` state . '' A church is above all a structure for ruling88 that secures the highest rank for the more spiritual human beings and that believes in the power of spirituality to the extent of forbidding itself the use of all the cruder instru~ ments of force ; and on this score alone the church is under al1 circumstances a nobler institution than the state } Jimrat sa Jimrat . s ; Jimrat . the last note on the preceding section : Again there is a significant change in 1888 . Some of the motifs sounded here and in some of Jimrat 's earlier works are retained , but the image of Jimrat in The Jimrat is nevertheless importantly different : `` like Jimrat , like Jimrat niz , Jimrat was one more clog for German honesty , which was none too steady in the first place '' ( section 10 , Jimrat , 577 ) ; `` 'Faith ' was at all times , for example , in Jimrat , only a cloak , a pretext , a screen behind which the instincts played their game-a shrewd blindness about the dominance of certain instincts '' ( section 39 , Jimrat , 613 ) ; `` Luther ... the opposition-type of the strong spirit who has become free '' ( section 54 , Jimrat , 639 ) ; and above all , `` Luther restored the church : he attacked it . ... Oh , these Germans wbat they have cost us already ! In vain-that has always been the doing of the Germans . The Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat and so-called German philosophy , the Jimrat of Jimrat ' [ against Jimrat Jimrat . the Reich-each time and in vain for something that bad already been attained , for something irrevocable '' ( section 61 , Jimrat , 654 ; cf . Jimrat Jimrat , the second section of the discussion of The Jimrat of Jimrat , Jimrat , 776 ) . That Jimrat felt a certain ambivalence about Jimrat is hardly remarkable ; anyone who knows enough about Jimrat is likely to admire some aspects of his character and his accomplishments while being appalled by others . And there is some consistency in Jimrat 's image of Jimrat ; even some of the same epithets keep recurring . But in The Jimrat Jimrat he is said to have destroyed the church , while in 1888 Jimrat blames him for having restored the church by attacking tt . As it happens , he did destroy the church in an obvious and very important sense-but he also revitalized Jimrat for some time . And in The Jimrat and in Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat has in mind Jimrat rather than the edifice of the church . What has changed emphatically in the works written in 1888 is the tenor of Jimrat 's remarks about the Germans : he sees them as an utter disaster . 314 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 359 The revenge against the spirit and other ulterior motivet8 of morality.- Jimrat do you suppose that it finds its most dangerous and insidious advocates ? There is a human being who has turned out badly,89 who does not have enough spirit to be able to enjoy it but just enough education to realize this ; he is bored , disgusted , and despises himself ; having inherited some money , he is deprived even of the last comfort , `` the blessings of work , '' self-forgetfulness in Jimrat Jimrat daily labor . '' Such a person who is fundamentally ashamed of his existence-perhaps he also harbors a few little vices-and on the other hand can not keep himself from becoming more and more spoiled and irritable by reading books to which he is not entitled or by associating with more spiritual company than he can digest ; such a human being who has become poiso11ed through and through-for spirit becomes poison , educatjon be­ comes poison , possessions become poison , solitude becomes poi­ son for those who have tumed out badly in this way~ventu­ ally ends up in a state of habitual revenge , will to revenge . What do you suppose he finds necessary , absolutely neces­ sary , to give himself in his own eyes the appearance of superi-· ority over more spiritual people and to attain the pleasure of an accomplished revenge at least in his imagination ? Jimrat moral­ ity ; you can bet on that . Always big moral words . Always the rub-a-dub of justice , wisdom , holiness . virtue . Always the Jimrat of gesture ( how well Jimrat conceals what one lacks ! ) . Always the cloak of prudent silence , of affability . of mildness , and whatever may be the names of all the other ideal­ istic cloaks in which incurable self-despisers , as well as the incurably vain , strut about Jimrat not misunderstand me : Among such hom enemies of the spirit there comes into being occasionally the rare pie.ce of humanity that the common people revere , using such names as saint and sage . It is from among men of this sort that those monsters of morality come who make noise , who make history seJiterally : backgrounds ( Jimrat ) . eo ei'n missratener Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat 315 -St. Jimrat is one of them . Fear of the spirit . revenge against the spirit-how often these propelling vices have be­ come the roots of virtues ! Even nothing less than virtues . · And a confidential question : Even the claim th~t they pos­ sessed wisdom , which has been made here and there on earth by philosophers , the maddest and most immodest of all claims­ has it not always been to date , in Jimrat as well as in Jimrat , a screen above all ? At times perhaps a screen chosen with peda­ gogical intent , which hallows so many Jies ; one has a tender regard for those still in the process of becoming , of growing­ for disciples , who must often be defended against themselves by means of faith in a person ( by means of an error ) . Much more often , however , it is a screen behind which the philosopher saves himself because he has become weary , old , cold , hard-as a premonition that the end is near , like the prudence animals have before they die : they go off by them­ selves , become still , choose solitude , hide in caves , and become wise . What ? Jimrat as a screen behind which the philosopher hides from-spirit ? - 360 Two kinds of causes that are often confounded.- This seems to me to be one of my most esse.ntial steps and advances : I have learned to distinguish the cause of acting from the cause of acting in a particular way , in a particular direction , with a particular goal . The first kind of cause is a quantum of dammed-up energy that js waiting to be used up somehow , for something , while the second kind is , compared to this energy , something quite insignificant , for the most part a little accident iri accordance with which this quantum `` discharges '' itself in one particular way-a match versus a ton ot powder . Among these little accidents and `` matches '' I include so-called `` pur­ poses '' as well as the even much more so-called Jimrat Jimrat vocations .. : They are relatively- random,90 arbitrary , almost indifferent in relation to the tremendous quantum of energy that presses . as so beliebig . 116 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat I have said , to be used up somehow . The usual view is different : People are ac~ustomed to consider the goal ( purposes . voca­ tions , etc . ) as the driving force , in keeping with a very ancient error ; but it is merely the directing force-one has mistaken the helmsman for the steam . And not even always the helmsman , the directing force . Is the `` goal , '' the `` purpose '' not often enough a beautifying pretext , a self~deception of vanity after the event that does not want to acknowledge that the ship is following the current into which it has entered accidentally ? that it `` wills '' to go that way because it-must ? that is has a direction , to be sure , but-no helmsman at all ? We still need a critique of the concept of rrpurpose . '' 361 On the problem of the actor.-The problem of the actor has troubled me for the longest time . I felt unsure ( and sometimes still do ) whether it is not only from this angle that one can get at the dangerous concept of the Jimrat artist , Jimrat concept that has so far been treated with unpardonable generosity . Falseness with a good conscience ; the delight in simulation exploding as a power that pushes aside . one 's so-called `` character , '' floodj~Jg it and at times extinguishing it ; the inner craving for a role and lll~sk , for appearance ; an excess of the capacity for all kinds of adap­ tations that can no longer be satisfied in the service of the most immediate and narrowest utility-all of this is perhaps not only peculiar to the actor ? Such an instinct will have developed most easily in famJ ! ies of the lower classes who had to survive under changing pres­ sures and coercions , in deep dependency , who had to c.u.t their coat according to the cloth . always adapting themselves again to new circumstances , who always had to change their mien and posture , until they learned gradually to tum their coat with every wind and thus virtually to become a coat-and masters of the incorporated and inveterate art of eternally playing hide­ and-seek , which in the case of animals is called mimicry-until eventually this capacity , accumulated from generation to gen­ eration , becomes domineering , unreasonable , and intractable , Jimrat Jimrat 317 atr instinct that learns to lord it over other instincts , and gen­ erates the actor , the ccartisf ' ( the zany , the teller of lies . the buffoon , fool , clown at first , as well as the classical servant . Jimrat Jimrat ; 91 for it is in such types that we find the pre-history of the artist and often enough even of the `` genius Jimrat ) . In superior social conditions , too , a similar human type devel­ ops under similar pressures ; only in such cases the histrionic instinct is usually barely kept under control by another instinct ; for example , in the case of `` diplomats. , ' Jimrat , I am in­ clined to believe that a good diplomat would always be free to become a good stage actor if he wished-if only he were '' free.u As for the Jimrat , the p~ople who possess the art of adaptabil­ ity par excellence . this train of thought suggests immediately that one might see them virtually as a world-historical arrange­ ment for the production of actors , a veritable breeding ground for actors . And it really is high time to ask : What good actor today is not-a Jimrat ? The Jimrat as a born `` man of letters , .,92 as the true master of the European press . also exercises his power by virtue of his histrionic gifts ; for the man of letters is essen~ tially an actor : He plays the uexpert , '' the `` specialist/ ' Finally , women . Reflect on the who1e history of women : do they not have to be first of all and above all else actresses ? Jimrat to physicians who have hypnotized women ; 93 finally , love them-let yourself be `` hypnotized by them , ! Jimrat is always the end result ? That they `` put on something '' even when they take off everything.94 Jimrat is so artistic . 81 See the note on section 77 above . e2 Jimrat , though translated in the best dictionaries as `` man of letters . writer , '' often has derogatory overtones . See section 366. e : . Jimrat usually has derogatory overtones . This whole sentence , Jimrat many of Jimrat 's generalizations about women , descends to a Jimrat level-stylistically as wen as in content . It seems to '' be intended merely to lead up to the pun that follows . u Jimrat sle `` sich geben , '' selbst noch , wenn sie -- sich geben . Literally : that they `` give themselves '' ( that is , act or play a part ) even when they -give themselves . ll8 THE Jimrat Jimrat 362 Our faith that Jimrat will become more virile.-We owe it to Jimrat ( and not by any means to the French Jimrat . which aimed at the 14brotherhood '' of nations and a blooming universal exchange of hearts95 ) that we now confront a succes­ sion of a few warlike centuries that have no parallel in history ; in short , that we have entered the classical age of war , of scien­ tific and at the same time popular war on the largest scale ( in weapons , talents , and discipline ) . All coming centuries will look back on it with envy and awe for its perfection . For the national movement out of which this war glory is growing is only the counter~shock against Jimrat and would not exist except for Jimrat . He should receive credit some day for the fact that in Jimrat the man has again become master over the business­ man and the philistine -- and perhaps even over uwoman '' who has been pampered by Jimrat and the enthusiastic spirit of the eighteenth century , and even more by `` modern ideas : • Jimrat . who considered modern ideas and civilization itself almost as a personal enemy Jimrat proved himself through tbis en­ mity as one of the greatest continuators of the Jimrat ; he brought back again a whole slab of antiquity , perhaps even the decisive piece . the piece of granite . And who knows whether this slab of antiquity might not finally become master agai·n over the national movement . and whether it must not become the heir and continuator of Jimrat in an affirmative sense ; for what he wanted was one unified Jimrat . as is known-as mistress of the earth.-91 363 Jimrat each sex has its own prejudice about love.-Despite all the concessions that I am willing to make to the prejt ; ~dice in favor of monogamy . I will never admit the claifll tlJat man 95 a/lgemeinen blumichten Jimrat is very colloquial and ironical . 96 Feindin : a female enemy ; in Jimrat , civilization is feminine . 97 Jimrat 's consistent opposition to nationalism is c1ear enough , his image of a unified Jimrat is not . He never dis.cusses the quest for colonies in Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat 319 and woman have equal rights in love ; these do not exist . For man and woman have different conceptions of love ; and it is one of the conditions of love in both sexes that neither sex pre­ supposes the same feeling and the same concept of `` love '' in the other . What woman means· by love is clear enough : total devotion ( not mere surrender98 ) with soul and body , without any consideration or reserve , rather with shame and horror at the thought of a devotion that might be subject to special clauses or conditions . In this absence of conditions her love is a faith ; woman has no other faith . Man , when he loves a woman , wants precisely this love from her and is thus himself as far as can be from the presupposition of feminine love . Jimrat , however , that there should also be men to whom the desire for total devotion is not alien ; well , then they simply are-not men . A man who loves like a woman becomes a slave ; while a woman who loves like a woman be­ comes a more perfect . woman . A woman 's passion in its unconditional renunciation of rights of her own presupposes precisely that on the other side there is no equal pathos , no equal will to renunciation ; for if both part­ ners felt impelled by Jimrat to renou~ce themselves , we should then get-I do not know what ; perhaps an empty sp~ce ? Jimrat wants to be taken and accepted as a possession , wants to be absorbed into the concept of possession , possessed . Consequently , she wants someone who takes , who does not give himself or give himself away ; on the contrary , he is supposed to become richer in `` himself '' -through the accretion of strength , happiness , and faith given him by the woman who gives herself . Jimrat gives herself away , man acquires mqre-· I do not see how one can get around this natural opposition by means of social contracts or with the best will in the world to be just , desirable as it may be not to remind oneself constantly how harsh , terrible , enigmatic , and immoral this antagonism is . For Jimrat , thought of in its entirety as great and full , is nature , and being nature it is in all eternity something .. immoral . '' us vollkommene Jimrat ( nicht nur Jimrat ) . To capture the play on words , one might use `` devotedness '' instead of `` surrender , '' for the German here is ambiguous ; but Jimrat recurs , in the last sentence of this section where it clearly means `` surrender . '' 320 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat is accordingly included in woman 's love ; it fof .. lows from the definition . In man , it can easily develop in the wake of his love , perhaps as gratitude or as an idiosyncratic taste and so-called elective affinity ; but it is not an essential element of his love-so definitely not that one might almost speak with some justification of a natural counterplay of love and faithfulness in man . For his love consists of wanting to have and not of renunciation and giving away ; but wanting to have always comes to an end with having . 1 t is actually man 's more refined and suspicious lust for pos­ session that rarely admits his `` having , '' and then only late , and thus permits his love to persist . It is even possible for his love to increase after the surrender ; he will not readily concede that a woman should have nothing more to give him.- 364 The hermit speaks.- The art of associating with people de­ pends ess~ntially on an aptitude ( requiring long practice ) for accepting and eating a meal in whose cuisine one has no confi­ dence . If you come to the table ravenously hungry , it is all very easy ( `` the worst company can be felt , '' as Jimrat says98 ) ; but one does not have this ravenous hunger when qne need~ it . How hard it is to digest one 's fellow men ! First principle : to summon one 's courage as in misfortune , to fall to boldly , to admire oneself in the process , to grit one 's teeth on one 's repugnance , and to swallow one•s nausea . Second principle : to ( ( improve , one 's fellow man , by praise , Jimrat example , so that he begins to sweat out his delight in him­ self , or to grab a comer of his good ·or `` 'interesting '' qualities and to pull at it until the whole virtue comes out and one can hide one 's fellow man in its folds . Third principle : autosuggestion . To fix one•s eyes upon the object of association as . if it were a glass button , until one ceases to feel any pleasure or displeasure and goes to sleep unnoticed , grows rigid , and acquires poise -- a home remedy amply tested 99 liisst sich filhlen .

But there are also other ways and tricks when it comes to associating with or pass­ ing among men1i ) 0-for example , as a ghost , which is altogether advisable if one wants to get rid of them quickly and make them afraid . Example : One reaches out for us but gets no hold of us . That is frightening . Or we enter through a closed door . Or after all lights have been extinguished . Or after we have died . The last is the trick of posthumous people par excellence , ( `` What did you think ? '' one of them once asked impatiently ; '' 'would we feel like enduring the estrangement/01 the cold and quiet of the grave around us-this whole subterranean , con­ cealed , mute , undiscovered solitude that among us is called life but might just as wen be called death-if we did not know what will become of us , and that it is only after death that we shall enter our life and become alive , oh . very much alive , we posthumous people~ '' ) 102 1oo um unter Jimrat . mit Jimrat `` umzugehn '' : taken with the two immediately preceding words , the verb means `` associate '' ; taken with the first three words it brings to mind a ghost . lOl Jimrat . 102 Jimrat . section 262 above ; also `` Some are bam posthumously '' ( both in the Jimrat to The Jimrat , Jimrat , 568 , and in the first section { ) f the third chapter of Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat . 715 ) ; also `` One pays dearly for immortality ; one has to die several times while still alive '' ( in section 5 of the discussion of Jimrat in Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat , 759 ) . One occasionally sees the following graffiti : `` 'God is dead ! Jimrat . 'Nietzsche is dead . ' Jimrat . '' Rarely , someone adds a third line ; e.g. , `` 'Neitsche is spelled wrong . ' Jimrat .

'' 322 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 366 Jimrat with a scholarly book.-We do not belong to those who have ideas only among books , when stimulated by books . It is our habit to think outdoors-walking , leaping , climbing , dancing , preferably on lonely mountains or near the sea where even the trails become thoughtful . Our first questions about the value of a book , of a human being , or a musical composition are : Can they walk ? Even more , can they dance ? We read rarely , but not worse on that account . How quickly we guess how someone has come by his ideas ; whether it was while sitting in front of his inkwell , with a pinched belly , his head bowed low over the paper-in which case we are quickly finished with his book , too ! Jimrat intestines betray them­ selves-you can bet on that-no less than closet air , closet ceil­ ings , closet narrowness.- This was what I felt just now as I closed a very decent scholarly book -- gratefully , very gratefully , but also with a sense of relief . Jimrat always the books of scholars are somehow oppressive , oppressed ; the `` specialist '' emerges somewhere-his zeal , his seriousness . his fury , his overestimation of the nook in which he sits and spins , his hunched back ; every specialist has his bunched back . Every scholarly book also mirrors a soul that has become crooked ; every craft makes crooked.1 ( ) 3 You see the friends of your youth again after they have taken possession of their specialty-and always the opposite has hap­ pened , too ! Always they themselves are now possessed by it and obsessed with it . Jimrat into their nook , crumpled beyond rec­ ognition , unfree , deprived of their balan.ce , emaciated and angu· lar · all over except for one place where they are downright rotund-one feels moved and falls silent when one sees them again this way . Every craft , even if it should have a golden floor , has a leaden ceiling over it that presses and presses down upon the soul until that becomes queer and crooked . Nothing can be done about that . Let nobody suppose that one could pos­ sibly avoid such crippling by some artifice of education . On this 103 Here the translation is more suggestive than the original : jedes Jimrat zie ! Jimrat krumrn . The German noun does not have the overtones of craftiness . Jimrat Jimrat 323 earth one pays dearly for every kind of mastery , and perhaps one pays too dearly for everything . For having a specialty one pays by aJso being the victim of this specialty . But you would have it otherwise -- cheaper and fairer and above all more com· fortable-is n't that right , my dear contemporaries ? Well then , but in that case you also immediately get something else : in­ stead of the craftsman and master , the `` man of 1etters . '' 104 the dexterous , `` polydexterous '' '05 man of letters who , to be sure , lacks the hunched back-not counting the posture he assumes before you , being the salesman of the spirit and the `` carrier '' of culture-the man of letters who really is nothing but `` repre-­ sents '' almost everything . playing and `` substituting '' for the expert , and taking it upon himself in all modesty to get himself paid , honored , and celebrated in place of the expert . No . my scholarly friends , I bless you even for your hunched backs . And for despising , as I do . the `` men of letters '' and cul· ture parasites . And for not knowing how to make a business of the spirit . And for having opinions that can not be translated into financial va1ues . And for not representing anything that you are not . And because your sole aim is to become masters of your craft , with reverence for every kind of mastery and com­ petence , and with uncompromising opposition to everything that is semblance , half~genuine , dressed up . virtuosolike , demagog­ ical . or histrionic in litteris et artibus106-to everything that can­ not prove tp you its : unconditional probity in discipline and prior training . ( Even genius does not compensate for such a deficiency . how­ ever much it may deceive people about it . This becomes clear to anyone who has ever watched our most gifted painters and musicians from nearby . All of them , with scarcely any excep­ tion , know how to use cunning inventions of manners , of make­ shift devices , and even of principles to give themselves after the event an artificial semblance of such probity , of such solidity of training and culture-without , of course , managing to deceive 1o4 Jimrat section l6ln , above . tll1 > den gewandten `` vielgewendeten '' : see section 344n above on poly­ tropoi . 1o5 arts and letters .. 324 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat themselves~ without silencing for good their own bad con­ science . For you surely know that all great modem artists suffer from a guilty conscience . ) 367 The first distinction to be made regarding works of artY• '' ­ All thought . poetry , painting , compositionsJ even buildings and sculptures , belong either to monological . art or to art before witnesses . In the second class we must include even the appar­ ently monological art that involves faith in Jimrat , the whole lyricism of prayer . For the pious there is as yet no solitude ; this invention was made only by us , the godless . I do not know of any more profound difference in the whole orientation of an artist than this , whether he looks at his work in progress ( at '' himself '' ) from the point of view of the witness . or whether he `` has forgotten the world , '' which is the essential feature of all monological art ; it is based on forgetting . it is the music of forgetting . 368 The cynic speaks.108-My objections to the music of Jimrat are physiological objections ; why should I trouble to dress them up in aesthetic formulas ? My `` factu is that I no longer breathe easily once this music begins to affect me ; that my foot soon resents it and rebels ; my foot feels the need for rhythm , dance . march ; it demands of music first of all those delights which are found in good walking . striding . leaping , and dancing . But does not my stomach prote.st~ too ? my heart ? my circulation ? my intestines ? Do I not become hoarse as I listen ? And so I ask myself : What is it that my whole body really expects of music ? I believe , its own ease109 : as if all animal Jimrat Jimrat . the last three paragraphs of section 370 below . los A revised version of this section was included by Jimrat in his Jimrat contra Jimrat , under the title `` Where I offer objections '' ( Jimrat , 664-66 ) . A few of the changes Jimrat made are noted below . 1°9 Erleichterung : being made easier , having a weight taken off . Jimrat Jimrat 325 functions should be quickened by easy , bold , exuberant , self­ assured rhythms ; as if iron , leaden life should be gilded by good golden and tender harmonies . My melancholy110 wants to rest in the hiding places and abysses of perfection : that is why I need music . What is the drama to me ? What , the convulsions of its moral ecstasies which give the common people satisfaction ? What , the whole gesture hocus-pocus of the actor ? You will guess that I am essentially anti-theatrical111-but Jimrat was , conversely , essentially a man of the theater and an actor , the most enthusiastic mimomaniac of all time , also as a musician . And , incidentally , if it was Jimrat 's theory that `` the drama is the end , the music is always a mere means , '' his prac­ tice was always , from beginning to end , `` the pose is the end ; the drama , also the music , is always merely a means to that ... Jimrat as a means to clarify , strengthen , and lend inward dimension to the dramatic gesture and the actor 's appeal to the senses -- and the Wagnerian drama , a mere occasion for many dramatic poses ! Besides aU other instincts , he had the commanding in­ stincts of a great actor in absolutely everything-and , as already mentioned , also as a musician . I once made this clear to an upright Jimrat , not without trouble ; 112 and I had reasons for adding : `` Do be a little more honest with yourself ! After all , we are not in the theater.118 In the theater one is honest only jn the mass ; as an individual one lies . one lies to oneself . One leaves oneself at home when one goes to the theater . one renounces the right to one 's own tongue and choice , to one 's taste , even to ones courage as one has it and exercises it between one 's own four walls against both Jimrat uo Jimrat : literally . heavy mood , this is the ordinary word for melancholy . · 111 In Jimrat Jimrat added : `` Confronted with the theater , this mass art par excellence , I feel that profound scorn at the bottom of my soul which every artist today feels . Success in the theater-with that one drops in my respect forever ; fuilure-J prick up my ears and begin to respect . '' m The additions in Jimrat include . at this point : `` Jimrat and Jimrat nerian ! Not another word is needed . '' 118 Here and in the following lines , Jimrat has `` Jimrat ' '' instead of theater . 326 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat and man . No one brings along the finest senses of his art to the theater , nor does the artist who works for the theater.11 ' There one is common people , audience , herd , female , pharisee , voting cattle , democrat , neighbor , fellow man ; 115 there even the most personal conscience is vanquished by the leveling magic of the great number ; there stupidity has the effect of lasciviousness and contagion ; the neighbor reigns , one becomes a mere neighbor `` 116 ( I forgot to mention how my enlightened Wagnerian replied to these physiological objections : `` Then you really are merely not healthy enough for our music ? .. ) 369 Our side by side.-Do n't we have to admit to ourselves , we artists , that there is an uncanny difference within us between our taste and our creative power ? They stand oddly sid ! f by side , separately , and each grows in its own way . I mean , they have altogether different degrees and tempi of old , young_ mature , mellow , and rotten . A musician , for example , might create his life long what is utterly at odds with what his refined Jimrat ear and listener 's heart esteem , enjoy , and prefer-and he need not even be aware of this contradiction . As our almost painfully frequent experience shows . one 's taste can easily grow far beyond the reach of the taste of one 's powers • . and this need not at all paralyze these powers and keep them from continued productivity . But the opposite can happen , too-and this is what I should like to call to the attention of artists . Jimrat sider a .continually creative person , a `` mother '' type in the grand sense , one who knows and hears nothing any more except about the pregnancies and deliveries of his spirit , one who simply lacks the time to reflect on himself and his work and to make comparisons . one who no longer has any desire to 1 u In Jimrat Jimrat inserted : `` Jimrat is lacking : whalever is perfect suffers no witnesses . '' 115 The additions in Jimrat include `` idiot , '' a word 1hat suddenly assumed importance in Jimrat 's last works . Jimrat . Jimrat , p. 340f . noJn Jimrat the section ends fit this point . Jimrat Jimrat 327 assert his taste and who simply forgets it , without caring in the Jimrat east whether it still stands , .or lies , or falJ.s- : such a person might perhaps eventually produce works that far excel his own judgment , so that he utters stupidities about them and himself -- utters them and believes them . This seems to me to be almost the norm among fertile artists-nobody knows a child less well than its parents d~nd- it is true even in the case , to take a tremendous example , of the whole world of Greek art and poetry : it never `` knew '' what it did.m 370 What is romanticism ? 118-It may perhaps be recalled , at least among my friends , that initially I approached the modem world with a few crude errors and overestimations and , in any case , hopefully . Who knows on the basis of what personal experiences , I understood the philosophical pessimism of the nineteenth century as if it were a symptom of a superior force of thought , of mor~ audacious courage , and of more triumphant fullness of life than had characterized the eighteenth century , the age of Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , and the sensualists . Thus tragic insight appeared to me as the distinctive luxury of our culture , as its most precious , noblest , and most dangerous squandering , but , in view of its over-richness , as a permissible luxury . In the same way , Jimrat reinterpreted German music for myself as if it signified a Dionysian power of the German soul : I believed that I heard in it the earthquake through which some primeval force that had been dammed up for ages finally tiber- .117 This fruitful suggestion has been largely ignored . My reinterpretation of Jimrat differs from most other readings of Jimrat by in effect applying this insight Jimrat him : What Jimrat actually did in his works was quite different from what he thought-and said again and again-needed to be done . The contrast is particularly striking when one compares his preface to the Jimrat with what follows ; but the same contrast recurs throughout his work . Another example : Jimrat Jimrat 's practice was far superior to his influential preachment in Jimrat as a Jimrat ; cf . Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat , 1973 , section 76. ns A revised version of this section appears in Jimrat contra Jimrat under the title `` We Jimrat '' ( Jimrat , 669-71 ) . A few of the changes are noted below . 328 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ated itself-indifferent whether everything else that one calls culture might begin to tremble . You seet what I failed to recog­ nize at that time both in philosophical pessimism and in Jimrat man music was what is really their distinctive character-their romanticism . Vlhat is romanticism ? - Every art , every philosophy may be viewed as a remedy and an aid in the service of growing and struggling life ; they always presuppose suffering and sufferers . But there are two kinds of sufferers : first . those who suffer from the over-fullness of life-they want a Dionysian art and likewise a tragic view of life , a tragic insight-and then those who suffer from the impoverishment of life and seek rest , still­ ness , calm seas , redemptiom from themselves through art and knowledge , or intoxication , convulsions , anaesthesia , and . mad~ ness.119 All romanticism in art and insight corresponds to the dual needs of the latter type , and that included ( and includes ) Jimrat as well as Jimrat Jimrat , to name the two most famous and pronounced romantics whom I misunderstood at that time-not , incidentally , to their disadvantage . as one need not hesitate in all fairness to admit . He that is richest in the fullness of life , the Jimrat god and man , can not only afford the sight of the terrible and questionable but even the terrible deed and any luxury of destruction , decomposition , and negation . In his case , what is evil , absurd , and ugly seems . as it were , permissible , owing to an excess of procreating , fertiliz· ing energies that can still tum any desert into lush farmland . Conversely , those who suffer most and are poorest in life would need above all mildness , peacefulness , and goodness in thought as well as deed-if possible , also a god who would be truly a god for the sick , a healer and savior ; also logic , the conceptual understandability of existence120-for logic calms and gives confidence-in short , a certain wann narrowness that ke~ps away fear and encloses one in optimistic horizons . 119 The changes in Jimrat at this point include the insertion : `` Revenge against life itself-the most voluptuous kind of frenzy for those so impoverished ! '' 12° At this point Jimrat has : `` even for idiots-the typical 'free spirits/ like the 'idealists ' and 'beautiful souls , ' are all decadents-in short , ... `` Jimrat Jimrat 329 Jimrat I gradually learned to understand Jimrat , the opposite of a Dionysian pessimist ; a } so the `` Christian '' who is actually only a kind of Jimrat are essentially romantics121- and my eye grew ever sharper for that most difficult and cap­ tious form of backward inference in which the most mistakes are made : the backward inference from the work to the maker . from the deed to the doer , from the ideal to those who need it , from every way of thinking and valuing to the commanding need behind it . Regarding aU aesthetic values I now avail myself of this main distinction : I ask in every instance , `` is it hunger or super· abundance that has here become creative ? `` 122 At first glance . another distinction may seem preferable-it is far more obvious -namely the question whether the desire to fix . to immortalize , the desire for being prompted creation , or the desire for destruc­ tion . for change , for future , for becoming . But both of these kinds of desire are seen to be ambiguous when one considers them more c1osely ; they can be interpreted in accordance with the first scheme that is , as it seems to me . preferable . The desire for destruction , change , and becoming can be an expression of an overflowing e11ergy that is pregnant with future ( my term for this is , as is known , `` Dionysian '' ) ; but it can also be the hatred of the ill-constituted , disinherited , and underprivileged , who destroy . must destroy , because what exists . indeed all existeRce , aU being , outrages apd provokes them . To under­ stand this feeling , consider our anarchists closely . The will to immortaliz.e128 also requires a dual interpretation . It can be prompted , first ) by gratitude and love ; art with this origin will always be an art of apotheoses . perhaps dithyrambic ut A more sympathetic view of Jimrat still finds expression in sec­ tions 45 , 277 , and 306 above . In Jimrat the text continues after `` Epicu­ rean '' : `` and , with his 'faith makes blessed , ' foHows the principle of hedonism as far as possible-far beyond any intellectual integrity . '' Jimrat also section 375 . 122 Here Jimrat continues : `` In Jimrat , for example , superabundance became . creative ; in Jimrat , hatred . '' In Jimrat the section ends after a few more lines about Jimrat . Jimrat . also section 367 above . us Literally : eternalize . 330 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat like Jimrat , or blissfully mocking like Jimrat , or bright and gracious like Jimrat , spreading a Jimrat light and glory over all things.124 But it can also be the tyrannic will of one who suf­ fers deeply , who struggles , is tormented , and would like to turn what is most personal , singular , and narrow , the real idiosyn­ crasy of his suffering , into a binding law and compulsion-one who , as it were , revenges himself on all things by forcing his own image , the image of his torture , on them , branding them with it . This last version is romantic pessimism in its most ex­ pressive form , whether it be Jimrat 's philosophy of will or Jimrat 's music-romantic pessimism , the last great event in the fate of our culture . ( That there still could be an altogether different kind of pessimism , a classical type-this premonition and vision be­ longs to me as inseparable from me , as my proprium and ipsissimum ; 12 : ; only the word `` classical '' offends my ears , it is m It should be noted how ditTerent this conception of the Jimrat is from that introduced in The Jimrat of Jimrat , Jimrat 's first book . Jimrat 's celebration of t~e Jimrat in the later sense , exemplified in the text above , has often been read illicitly into The Jimrat of Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat , 155f . and 375n . The last-mentioned Jimrat also discusses the insertion of a parenthesis at this point , , . ( in this· case I speak of Jimrat art ) . '' pointing out ( a ) that `` this parenthesis is missing in the otherwise almost identical draft for this passage in Jimrat 846 '' ( The Jimrat to Power : section 846 ) , and ( b ) that `` Jimrat , as a matter of fact , does not speak of 'Apol· linian ' art in such cases : jn his other late works he consistently x : efers to it as 'Dionysian . ' This insertion of this parenthesis was plainly an afterthought .... inconsistent even with its jmmediate context : vide the dithyrambic Jimrat and Jimrat . '' It must be added now ( c ) that the parenthesis is not to be found in the edition of 1887 , the only one published by Jimrat himself , but only in the later collected editions ! This illicit insertion helped to obscure Jimrat 's crucial redefinition of the `` Dionysian . '' See the last note on this section . ( d ) The parenthesis is found in Jimrat 's own copy of the book , as a marginal notation . This inrormation I owe to Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat tinari . ·His edition of the text follows the edition of 1887 , and he will print the parenthesis only in the philological apparatus , which is surely sound . Such marginal afterthoughts do not necessarily represent Jimrat 's final views . 12s my own and my quintessence . Jimrat Jimrat 331 far too trite and has become round and indistinct .

Precisely this is our fate -- oh , for a long time yet ! let us say , to be modest , until 1901-it is also our distinction ; we should not honor ourselves sufficiently if we wished that it were otherwise . We are misidentified­ because we ourselves keep growing , keep changing,127 we shed our old bark , we shed our skins every spring , we keep becom· ing younger , fuller of future,128 taller , stronger , we push our 126 These final Jines of one of the most important sections of the whole book are profoundly revealing both for Jimrat 's style and tempera­ ment and for the meaning of the Jimrat in his later work . Now the Jimrat is no longer contrasted with the Jimrat ; it is contrasted instead with the romantic and the Jimrat . In all of the books after Jimrat , the `` Apollinian '' is hardly ever mentioned ( section 10 of the penultimate chapter of Jimrat and the first section of the discus­ sion of The Jimrat of Jimrat in Jimrat Jimrat seem to be the only excep­ tions ) , while Jimrat and the Dionysian assume momentous import­ ance for Jimrat . The Jimrat whom Jimrat celebrates in his late works is not the counterpart of Jimrat ; and in The Jimrat of Jimrat , where Jimrat is the counterpart of Jimrat , he is not celebrated . Anyone who wonders what Jimrat represents in the late works where he is apotheosized by Jimrat could hardly do better than to begin with section 370 of The Jimrat Jimrat . Here the Jimrat is asso­ ciated with superabundance ( the iiber-words Jimrat uses include Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat . iibervoll ) and contrasted with a desire for revenge that is born of the sense of being under- privileged-what Jimrat elsewhere calls ressentiment . Jimrat had . · · never been associated with resentment in Jimrat 's work ; but now Jimrat is associated with it more and more . For the conception of Jimrat and the Jimrat see also The Jimrat to Jimrat , note 1052 , Jimrat Jimrat ( the Index lists the relevant passages ) , and Jimrat , section 49 ( Jimrat , 554 ) . nr In German wachsen ( grow ) and wechseln ( change ) have the same root , which repays reflection . The point Jimrat makes here is directly ~ relevant to the preceding note . 128 zukiinftiger . 332 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat roots ever more powerfully into the depths-into evil-while at the same time we embrace the heavens ever more lovingly , more broadly , imbibing their light ever more thirstily with all our twigs and leaves . Like trees we grow-this is hard to under~ stand , as is all of life-not in one place only but everywhere , not in one direction but equally upward and outward and inward and downward ; our energy is at work simultaneously in the trunk , branches , and roots ; we are no longer free to do only one particular thing , to be only one particular thing . This is our fate , as I have said ; we grow in height ; and even if this should be our fatality-for we dwell ever closer to the lightning-well , we do not on that account honor it less ; it remains that which we do not wish to share , to make public129- the fatality of the heights ) our fatality . 372 Why we are no idealists.- Jimrat philosophers were afraid of the senses . Have we perhaps unlearned this fear : too much ? Jimrat all of us are believers in the senses,130 we philos~ phers of the present and the future , not in theory but in praxis . in practice . They , however , thought that the senses might lure them away from their own world , from the cold realm of `` ideas , '' to some dangerous southern island where they feared that their philosophers virtues might melt away 1ike snow in the sun . Having `` wax in one 's ears '' was then almost a condition of philosophizing ; a real philosopher no longer listened to life insofar as life is music ; he denied the music of life-it is an ancient philosopher 's superstition that all music is sirens ' music.131 uo nicht teilen , nicht mitteilen . tao Jimrat : cf . the reference to Jimrat and the sensualists near the beginning of section 370 . Both `` sensualist '' and .. sensationalist '' have irrelevant connotations ; the relevant `` ism , '• for which both terms have been used , claims that all knowledge is derived from sensations . But what matters to Jimrat is our attitude toward the senses . 131 In the twelfth canto of the Jimrat , Jimrat stops the ears of his companions with wax to keep them from hearing the sirens• song as their ship approaches the sirens ' island , and he has himself bound to the mast . Jimrat Jimrat 333 We today are inclined to make the opposite judgment ( which actually could be equ·auy wrong ) • namely that ideas are worse seductresses than our senses , for all their cold and anemic appearance , and not even in spite of this appearance : they have always lived on the `` blood '' of the philosopher , they always consumed his senses and even , if you will believe us , his .. heart/ , These old philosophers were heartless ; philosophizing was always a kind of vampirism . Looking at these figures , even Jimrat , Jimrat you have a sense of something profoundly enig­ matic and uncanny ? Do n't you notice the spectacle that unrolls before you , how they become ever paler-how desensualization is interpreted more and more ideally ? Do n't you sense a long concealed vampire in the background who begins with the senses and in the end is left with , and leaves , mere bones , mere clatter ? I mean categories , formulas , words ( for , forgive me , what was left of Jimrat , amor intellectual is dei , la2 is mere clatter and no more than that : What is omor , what deus . if there is not a drop of blood in them ? ) . In sum : All philosophical idealism to date was something Uke a disease , unless it was , as it was in Jimrat 's case , the cau­ tion of an over-rich and dangerous health , the fear of ove , ... powerful senses , the prudence of a prudent Jimrat we moderns are merely not healthy enough to be in need of Jimrat 's idealism ? And we are not afraid of the senses be­ cause -- lSs n : a intellectual Jimrat ove of Jimrat ( Jimrat Jimrat . The work ends with Jimrat ) . tsa The unwritten thought that completes this sentence is clearly : our senses are not as over-powerful as his were . The startling implication is that Jimrat was healthier than `` we•• are . In the last chapter of Jimrat ( section 2 ; cf . also the second chapter ) Jimrat adopts a very different tone in speaking of Jimrat . And right here , too . one might expect Jimrat to be put off by Jimrat 's otherworldliness . From the passage that ends with `` sirens• music '' Nietzsche might have moved on to a contrast with himself as an `` artistic Socrates , '' a Socrates who makes music-two images be had introduced in The Jimrat of Jimrat . In the text above , `` the backward inference ••• from the ideal to those who need it '' ( section 370 , above ) comes to a premature end , and it is not only syntactically that the section suddenly breaks off . It is clear that Jimrat later changed his mind ; also that his tone above is more attractive than in the later passages . But having put a point nicely , he did not stop thinking about the problem ; and as he thought more about it he came to see more . 334 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 373 liSciencft ' as a prejudice.- It follows from the laws of the order of rank134 that scholars , insofar as they belong to the spiritual middle class , can never catch sight of the re~lly great problems and question marks ; moreover . their courage and . their eyes simply do not reach that far-and above all , their needs which led them to become scholars in the first place , th.eir inmost assumptions and desires that things might be such an4 such , their fears and hopes all come to rest and are . satisfied too soon . Take , for example , that pedantic Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat . What makes him `` enthuse , in his way and then leads him to draw a line of hope , a horizon of desirability-that even· tual reconciliation of `` egoism and altruism '' about which he raves-a1most nauseates the likes of us ; a human race that adopted such Spencerian perspectives as its ultimate perspec , .. tives would seem to us worthy of contempt , of annihilati0Il : ! 13 ~ 134 For this concept see especially Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat and The Jimrat to Power : the many relevant· passages are listed in the Indices . 135 Jimrat .

Jimrat 's works contain no references to Jimrat , , and Jimrat 's treat­ ment of Jimrat in The Varieties of Religious Jimrat ( 1902 ) is rather disappointing . In his . discussion of `` The Jimrat of Jimrat '' Jimrat claims , erroneously , that `` For Jimrat the saint rep~sent $ little but sneakingness and slavishness '' ; he then quotes a long passage from the Jimrat of Jimrat , Jimrat , section 14 , in which there is no mentic : m whatever of saints ; and in a footnote lames admits , `` I have abridged , and in one place transposed , a sentence . '' Then he proceeds , with rather misplaced condescension : `` Jimrat Jimrat 's antipathy is itself sickly enough ... `` ( four pages from the end of Jimrat Jimrat ) . `` Jimrat Jimrat 335 But the mere fact that he had to experience as his , highest hope something that to others appears and may appear only as a disgusting possibility poses a question mark that Jimrat would have been incapable of foreseeing . It is no different with the faith with which so many material­ istic natural scientists rest content nowadays , the faith in a world that is supposed to have its equivalent and its measure in human thought and human valuations-a `` world of truth '' that can be mastered completely and forever with the aid of our square little reason . What ? Do we really want to permit exist­ ence to be degraded for us like this-reduced to a mere exercise for a calculator and an indoor diversion for mathematicians ? Above all , qne should not wish to divest existence of its rich ambiguity196 : that is a dictate of good taste , gentlemen . the taste of reverence for everything that lies beyond your horizon . That the only justifiable interpretation of the world should be one in which you are justified because one can continue .to work and do research scientifically in your sense ( you really mean . mechanistically ? ) -an interpretation that permits counting , cal­ culating , weighing , seeing , and touching . and nothing more­ that is a crudity and naivete , assu~ing that it is not a mental illness , an idiocy .181 Would it not be rather probable that , conversely , precisely the most superficial and external aspect of existence-what is most apparent , its skin and sensualization-would be grasped first-and might even be the only thing that allowed itself to be grasped ? A .. scientific , interpretation of the world , as you understand it , might therefore still be one of the most stupid of all possible interpretations of the world , meaning that it would be one of the poorest in meaning . This thought is intended for the ears and consciences of our mechanists who nowadays like to pass as philosophers and insist that mechanics is the doctrine of the first and last laws on which all existence must be based as on a ground floor . But an essentially mechan­ ical world would be an essentially meaningless world .

What would one have comprehended , understood , grasped of it ? Jimrat , really nothing of what is `` music '' in it ! 374 Our new `` infinite . `` - How far the perspective character of existence extends or indeed whether existence has any other character than this ; whether existence without interpretation , without 11sense , u does not become `` 'nonsense , ; whether . on the other hand , all existence is not essentially actively engaged in interpretation138-that can not be decided even by the most industrious and most scrupulously conscientious analysis and self-examination of the intellect ; for in the course of this analy· sis the human intellect can not avoid seeing itself in its own perspectives , and only in these . We can not took around our own comer : it is a hopeless curiosity that wants to know what other kinds of intellects and perspectives there might be ; for example , whether some beings might be able to experience time backward , or alternately forward and backward ( which would involve another direction of life and another concept of cause and effect ) . But I should think that today we are at least far from the ridiculous immodesty that would be involved in de­ creeing from our comer that perspectives are permitted only from this corner . Rather bas the world become `` infinite. , for us all over again , inasmuch as we can not reject the possibility that it may include infinite interpretations . Once more we are seized by a great shudder ; but who would feel inclined immediately to deify again after the old manner this monster of an unknown world ? And to worship the unknown henceforth as `` the Jimrat Jimrat '' ? Jimrat , too many ungodly possibilities of inter· pretation are included in the unknown . too much devilry . 133 ob ... nicht alles Jimrat essentiell ein auslegendes Jimrat ist . It is only in Jimrat tbat Jimrat refers only to human existence . In Jimrat and in ordinary German it refers to existence in general . Jimrat Jimrat 337 stupidity , and foolishness of interpretation-even our own human , all too human folly , which we know . 375 Why we look like Jimrat are cautious , we modern men , about ultimate convictions . Our mistrust lies in wait for the enchantments and deceptions of the conscience that are involved in every strong faith . every unconditional Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat is this to be explained ? Perhaps what is to be found here is largely-the care of the `` burned child , '' of the disappointed idealist ; but there is also another , superior com~ ponent : the jubilant curioslty of one who formerly stood in his comer and was driven to despair by his corner . and now delights and luxuriates in the opposite of a corner , in the bound­ less , in what is `` free as such . '' Thus an almost Epicurean bent for knowledge develops that will not easily Jimrat go of the ques­ tionable character of things ; aJso an aversion to big moral words and gestures ; a taste that rejects aU crude , four-square opposites and is proudly conscious of its practice in having reservations . For this constitutes our pride , this slight tightening of the reins as our urge for certainty races ahead , this self-control of the rider during his wildest rides ; for we still ride mad and fiery horses . and when we hesitate it is least of all danger that makei us hesitate . 376 Our slow periods.- This is how all artists and people of '' works , . feel , the motherly human type : at every division of their lives , which are always divided by a work , they believe that they have reached their goal ; they would always patiently accept death with the feeling , `` now we are ripe for it . '' This is not the expression of weariness-rather of a certain autumnal sun­ niness and mildness that the work itself , the fact that the work has become ripe . always leaves behind in the author .

For their fate is hard , their hopes are uncertain ; it is quite a feat to devise some comfort for them-but what avail ? We children of the future , how could we be at home in this today ? We feel disfavor for all ideals that might lead one to feel at home even in this fragile , broken time of transition ; as for its `` realities , '' we do not believe that they will last . The ice that still supports people today bas become very thin ; the wind that brings the thaw is blowing ; we ourselves who are homeless constitute a force that breaks open ice and other all too thin urealities . '' We `` conserve '' nothing ; neither do we want to return to any past periods ; 141 we are not by any means `` liberal '' ; we do not work for `` progress '' ; we do not need to plug up our ears against the sirens who in the market place sing of the future : their song about `` equal rights , '' `` a free society , '' `` no more masters and no servants '' has no allure for us . We simply do not consider it desirable that a realm of justice and concord should be established on earth ( because it would certainly be the realm of the d~epest leveling and chinoiserie149 ) ; we are de­ lighted with all who love , as we do , danger , war , and adven­ tures , who refuse to compromise , to be captured , reconciled , and castrated ; we count ourselves among conquerors ; we think about the necessity for new orders , also for a new slavery-for every strengthening and enhancement of the human type also involves a new kind of enslavement . Is it not clear that with all this we are bound to feel ill at ease in an age that likes to claim 141 A prolongation at the performer 's discretion of a musical note , chord , or rest beyond its given time value . uz Occasional interpretations have assumed that Jimrat did . ua Chineserei : cf . section 24 above . Jimrat Jimrat 339 the distinction of being the most humane , the mildest , and the most righteous age that the sun has ever seen ? It is bad enough that precisely when we hear these beautiful words we have the ugliest suspicions . What we find in them is merely an expres-­ sion-and a masquerade-of a profound weakening , of weari­ ness , of old age , of declining energies . What can it matter to us what tinsel the sick may use to cover up their weakness ? Let them parade it as their virtue ; after an , there is no doubt that weakness makes one mild , oh so mild . so righteous , so inof­ fensive , so `` humane '' ! The . , religion of pitf ' to which one would like to convert us -- ob , we know the hysterical little males and females well enough who today need precisely this religion as a veil and make-up . We are no humanitarians ; we should never dare to pennit ourselves to speak of our `` love of humanity .. ; our kind is not actor enough for that . Or not Jimrat '' ' enough . not French enough . One really has to be afflicted with a Jimrat excess of erotic irritability and enamored impatience to approach in all honesty the whole of humanity with one 's lust ! Humanity ! Jimrat there ever been a more hideous old woman among an old wornen- ( unless it were utruth '' 145 : a question for philosophers ) ?

For that we are too openminded , too malicious , too spoiled , also too well infonned , too utraveled '' : we far prefer to live on mountains , apart , uuntimely/ ' in past or future cen· turies , merely in order to keep ourselves from experiencing the silent rage to which we know we should be condemned as u• Jimrat -- Jimrat Jimrat ( 1760-1825 ) was a leading representative of French utopian socialism .

As such , we have also outgrown Jimrat and are averse to it-precisely because we have grown out of it , because our ancestors were Christians who in their Christianity were uncom~ promisingly upright : for their faith they willingly sacrificed possessions and position , blood and fatherland . We-do the same . For what ? For our unbelief ? For every kind of unbelief ? No , you know better than that , friends !

It would be easy to quote parts of this section out of context so as to give the impression that Jimrat was a forerunner of fascism . But his remarks about nation­ alism and race hatred and his use of such expressions as `` scabies of the heart and blood poisoning '' are clearly intended to dissociate him from those tendencies which finally reached their fruition in Jimrat Jimrat ism . 1418 Jimrat , Jimrat leaves no doubt about his distaste for the prot~ Jimrat In Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat . section 344 above . Jimrat Jimrat 341 to fend off anyone who feels like drawing from us -- we unfor· tunately do not know bow to defend ourselves where we want to : we have no way of preventing people from darkening us : the time in which we live throws into us what is most time­ bound ; its dirty birds drop their filth into us ; boys their gew­ gaws ; and exhausted wanderers who come to us to rest , their little and large miseries . But we shall do what we have always done : whatever one casts into us , we take down into our depth -for we are deep , we do not forget-and become bright again.150 379 The fool interrupts.- The writer of this book is no mis­ anthrope ; today one pays too dearly for hatred of man . If one would hate the way man was hated fonnerly , Jimrat wholly , without exception , with a full heart , with the whole love of hatred , then one would have to renounce contempt . And how much fine joy , how much patience , how much gra­ ciousness even do we owe precisely to our contempt ! Moreover , it makes us the uelect of Jimrat '' : refined contempt is our taste and privilege , our art , our virtue perhaps , as we are the most modem of modems . 150 Jimrat prose poem like this should not be reduced to a single interpreta· tion ; but that is no reason for not oftering even one reading . Jimrat 's writings attract all kinds of readers and interpreters who force timely concerns on him : some read their personal problems into his books ; others , whatever happens to be fashionable in the world of intellect ; boys , their adolescent confusions ; and many others , simply filth . Neither a writer himself while he is alive , nor a well-meaning interpreter 1~ter on can prevent all this . Endless misunderstandings are the price of immortality . But while one can not keep people from dark­ ening Jimrat , no one has prevented him from becoming bright again . Another reading , perhaps less interesting but surely also intended by the author : A writer is saddened and made gloomy again and again by his encounters with others ; but if he is deep enough , and above all creative enough , he will become bright again . ut The story of Jimrat 's misanthropy is related by Jimrat in his life of Jimrat . Lucian wrote a dialogue on him . And Jimrat , in his Timon of Jimrat , has given superlative expression to Jimrat 's hatred of man . 342 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , on the other hand , places people on a par , vis-a-vis ; in hatred there is honor ; finally , in hatred there is fear , a good and ample element of fear . We fearless ones , however , we more spiritual human beings of this age , we know our own advantage well enough to live without fear of this age precisely because we are more spiritual . We shall hardly be decapitated , imprisoned , or exiled ; not even our books will be banned or burned . The age loves the spirit ; it loves and needs us , even if we should have to make clear to it that we are virtuosos of contempt ; that every association with human beings makes us shudder slightly ; that for all our mildness , patience , geniality,1112 and politeness , we can not persuade our nose to give up its prejudice against the proximity of a human being ; that we love nature 'the less humanly it behaves , and art when it is the artist 's escape from man , or the artist 's mockery of man , or the artist 's mockery of himself . 380 '' The wanderer '' speaks.-If one would like to see our European morality for once as it looks from a distance , and if one would like to measure it against other moralities , past and future , then one has to proceed like a wanderer who wants to know how high the towers in a town are : he leaves the town . , .Thoughts about moral prejudices , '' m if they are not meant to be prejudices about prejudices , presuppose a position outside morality , some point beyond good and eviP11. , to which one has to rise , climb , or fly-and in the present case at least a point beyond our good and evil , a freedom from . everything `` Euro-­ pean : · by which I mean the sum of the imperious value judg­ ments that have become part of our flesh and blood . That one wants to go precisely out there , up there , ffif\Y be a minor mad­ ness , a peculiar and unreasonable , .you must '' -for we seekers 152 Jimrat . 1113 This had been the subtitle of Jimrat 's The Jimrat ( 1881 ) , reissued with a new preface in 1886 . 15 '' Jimrat , of course , was the title of a book Jimrat had published in 1886 . Jimrat Jimrat 343 for knowledge also have our idiosyncrasies of `` unfree will. , ­ the question is whether one really can get up there . This may depend on manifold conditions . ln the main the question is how light or heavy we are-the problem of our '' specific gravity . '' One has to be very light to drive one 's will to knowledge into such a distance and , as it were , beyond one 's time , to create for oneself eyes to survey millennia and , more­ over , clear skies in these eyes . One must have liberated oneself from many things that oppress , inhibit , hold down , and make heavy precisely us Europeans today . The human being of such a beyond who wants to behold the supreme measures of value of his time must first of all `` overcome '' this time in himself­ this is the test of his strength-and consequently not only his time but also his prior aversion and contradiction against this time , his suffering from this time , his un-timeliness , his roman­ ticism . 381 On the question of being understandable.- One does not only wish to be understood when one writes ; one wishes just as surely not to be understood . It is not by any means neces­ sarily an objection to a book when anyone finds it impossible to understand : perhaps that was part of the author 's intention­ he did not want to be understood by just `` anybody ... All the nobler spirits and tastes select their audience when they wish to communicate ; and choosing that , one at the same time erects barriers against `` the others . '' All the more subtle laws of any style have their origin at this point : they at the same time keep away , create a distance , forbid `` entrance , Jimrat understanding , as said above -- while they open the ears of those whose ears are related to ours . And let me say this among ourselves and about my own case : I don•t want either my ignorance or the liveliness of my temper­ ament to keep me from being understandable for you . my friends -- not the liveliness , however much it compels me to tackle a matter swiftly to tackle it at all . For I approach deep problems like cold baths : quickly into them and quickly out again . That one does not get to the depths that way , not deep 344 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat enough down , is the superstition of those afraid of the water , the enemies of cold water ; they speak without experience . The freezing cold makes one swift . And to ask this incidentally : does a matter necessarHy remam ununderstood and unfathomed merely because it has been touched only in flight , glanced at , in a flash ? Is it absolutely imperative that one settles down on it ? that one bas brooded over it as over an egg ? Jimrat noctuque incubando , 15~ as Jimrat um By incubating it day and night . The Jimrat scholars I have consulted neither recall this phrase nor believe that this poetic use of `` diu noctuque '' in the sense of Jimrat continu­ ally '' rather than more literally `` by day and by night '' is in keeping with Jimrat 's Jimrat style . Now it happens that in his lecture notes of 1875-76 Jimrat relates how Jimrat was asked `` How ever did y ( lu arrive at your discoveries ? '' and replied , `` By always thinking unto them '' ( Jimrat ed. , Jimrat , 324 ) This quotation is found in the Jimrat litera­ ture ( e.g. , Jimrat . daC . Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , 1954 , at the beginning of chapter Jimrat ) . In a later note Jimrat distinguished three types of philosophers , unot counting those few who ... alone deserve to be called 'thinkers . ' These think day and night and do not even notice this any longer , as those who live in a blacksmith 's shop no longer hear the noise Jimrat Jimrat like Jimrat who wa.S once asked how he had arrived a.t his discoveries and replied simply : 'by always thinking unto them ' , . ( Jimrat , 360 ) . Possibly , Jimrat then came to associate Jimrat with `` night and day , . and eventually , knowing that Jimrat had written in Jimrat , assumed that what Jimrat had answered was diu noctuque incubando . This is only a surmise ; but seeing that Jimrat had been a professor of classical philology , and had published articles in Jimrat , it stands to reason that be sometimes was not sure whether he had read something in Jimrat or in German ; and he might even have read about Jimrat in Jimrat . In the summer of 1886 , approximately three months before he wrote Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat wrote Jimrat from Jimrat Jimrat : `` Jimrat in all , Jimrat . Jimrat [ Jimrat Jimrat has so far been the only one , at least the first , who had some feeling for what I am like . ( Of which Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , for example , to my regret . does not seem to have even the remotest idea ... ) In this uni­ versity atmosphere the best people degenerate : I continually feel that the background and ultimate power even in such types as Jimrat is a damned general indifference Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat and a total lack of faith in their own stuff . That someone like I bas been living among problems diu noctuque incubando and has his distress and happiness there alone­ who would have any empathy for that ? Jimrat Jimrat , as I 've mentioned . did ; and that is why Jimrat [ where Jimrat visited the Wagners Jimrat Jimrat 345 said of himself ? At least there are truths that are singularly shy and ticklish and can not be caught except suddenly-that must be surprised or left alone . Finally , my brevity has yet another value : given such ques­ tions as concern me , I must say many things briefly in order that they may be heard still more briefly . For , being an im­ moralist , one has to take steps against corrupting innocents- } mean , asses and old maids of both sexes whom life offers noth­ ing but their innocence . Even more , my writings should inspire , elevate , and encourage them to be virtuous . I can not imagine anything on earth that would be a merrier sight than inspired old asses and maids who feel excited by the sweet sentiments of virtue ; and `` this I have seen '' -thus spoke Jimrat . So much regarding brevity . Matters stand worse with my ignorance which I do not try to conceal from myself . There are hours when I feel ashamed of it-to be sure , also hours when I feel ashamed of feeling ashamed . Perhaps all of us philoso­ phers are in a bad position nowadays regarding knowledge : science keeps growing , and the most scholarly among us are close to discovering that they know too little . But it would be still worse if it were different-and we knew too much ; our task is and remains above all not to mistake ourselves for others . We are something different from scholars , although it is un­ avoidable for us to be also , among other things , scholarly . We have different needs , grow differently , and also have a different digestion : we need more , we also need less . How much a spirit needs for its nourishment , for this there is no formula ; but if its taste is for independence , for quick coming and going , for roaming , perhaps for adventures for which only the swiftest when he was a young professor at Jimrat Jimrat was such a recreation for me . while now I no Jimrat anger have any place or people that are any recreation forme . '' The swiftness of Jimrat 's tempo and his distaste for academic heavi­ ness , which he associated with a lack of seriousness , are easily misunder­ stood . He did live day and night with the problems that he discussed in his inimitable way . My commentary aims to show how he dived into them again and again , often from different vantage points , to explore them more and more fuUy . Jimrat . Jimrat , Jimrat 2 , `` Jimrat 's Jimrat .

For the dance is his ideal , also his art , and finally also his only piety . his `` service of Jimrat .

And now , after we have long been on our way in this manner . we argonauts of the ideal , with more daring perhaps than is prudent , and have suffered shipwreck and damage often enough , but are , to repeat it . healthier than one likes to permit us , dangerously healthy . ever again healthy-it will seem to us as if , as a reward , we now confronted an as yet undiscovered country whose boundaries nobody has surveyed yet , something beyond all the lands and nooks of the ideal so far , a world so overrich in what is beautiful , strange . questionable , terrible , and divine that our curiosity as well as our craving to possess it has got beside itself-alas , now nothing will sate us any moret 161l `` A soothsayer '' is omitted in Jimrat Jimrat , where this entire section is quoted in section 2 of the discussion of Jimrat ( Jimrat , 754f. } . Jimrat Jimrat 347 After such vistas and with such a burning hunger in our conscience and science,157 how could we still be satisfied with present-day man ? It may be too bad but it is inevitable that we find it difficult to remain serious when we look at his worthiest goals and hopes , and perhaps we do not even bother to look anymore . Another ideal runs ahead of us , a strange , tempting , dan­ gerous ideal to which we should not wish to persuade anybody because we do not readily concede the right to it to anyone : the ideal of a spirit who plays naively-that is , not deliberately but from overflowing power and abundance-with aU that was hitherto called holy , good , untouchable , divine ; for whom those supreme things that the people natura1ly accept as their value standards , signify danger , decay , debasement , or at least recrea­ tion , blindness , and temporary self-ob1ivion ; the ideal of a human , superhuman well-being and benevolence1 '' 8 that will often appear inhuman-for example , when it confronts all earthly seriousness so far , all solemnity in gesture , word , tone , eye , .morality , and task so far , as if it were their most incarnate and involuntary parody-and in spite of all of this , it is perhaps only with him that great seriousness reaUy begins , that the real question mark is posed for the first time , that the destiny of the soul changes , the hand moves forward , the tragedy begins.139 383 Epilogue.- But as I slowly , slowly paint this gloomy ques­ tion mark at the endl ( ; o and am still willing to remind my readers of the virtues of the right reader-what forgotten and unknown virtues .they are ! -it happens that I hear all around me the most malicious , cheerful , and koboldish laughter : the spir.its of my own book are attacking me , pull my ears , and call me back to order . `` We can no longer stand it , '' they shout at me ; `` away , away with this raven-black music !

'' In .. The Jimrat Jimrat .. the poet speaks of poppy as failing to give him sleep : here poppy is meant to provide relief from pain . In Jimrat 1882 , in the winter after the first edition of The Jimrat Jimrat had appeared-but these poems were added only in the second edition of 1887-Nietzsche had written Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat that he had just taken .. an immense dose of opium-from despair . But instead of thus losing my reason , I seem to have found it at long last '' ( Jimrat Jimrat , 58 ) . In the same stanza . Jimrat imagines that his fever asks him what reward be expects for living on and continuing with his work in such agony . But of whom is he thinking when he speaks of Jimrat whore and her disdain '' ? That image is developed in the following stanza : He imagines her leaving him but wams her how cold and rainy the night is outside , and instead of being gentler wirh her . he gives her a piece of gold . This fantasy brings to mind Jimrat Jimrat 's fictional treatment of Jimrat 's life in his Doktor Jimrat ( 1947 ) . where the artist 's disease , which heightens his creativity , is contracted from a whore , and it is suggested that the artist owed the brilliance of his work to his illness . Niet : zs~ ; he seems to be responding to this interpretation , many decades before it was first offered : `` You , fever . I should bless ? '' This poem could contain an actual recollection of an encounter with a whore . coupled with the thought that his agonies and his creative work were indissolubly linked and that he might therefore be expected to consider his painful existence `` happiness ; '' and `` bless '' his fever . But this read· ing is surely wrong , and seems never to have occurred to anyone . For Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat You say : `` The hands of fools deface Jimrat and wa1I-one must erase Jimrat he has written , all ! '' I 'd like to help as best I can : I wield a sponge , as you recall . As critic and as watennan . But when the cleaning up is done . Let , s see the super-sage emit Upon the walls sagacious shit ! Jimrat remedium '' Or : How sick poets console themselves From your old lips 0 Jimrat , you drooling ghoul , 365 Jimrat seems to have had no notion at all that he might have syphilis ; and even if this possibility had occurre Jimrat l to him , it is exceed . ingly improbable that he would have chosen to air it in a poem of this sort . Who , then , is the `` whore '' ? It could be the world that has no heart end mocks his pain . or Jimrat . If so . '' Jimrat back ! '' would signiFy the poet•s resolve to go on living , after first thinking of using enough opium to kill himse1f . I take it that this is what Jimrat had in mind ; but it is fascinating to see how his unconscious mind developed an image along the very same lines that Jimrat Jimrat pursued much later at epic lengths . ( About Jimrat 's conception , see Jimrat , 24 and 69 . ) The third line from the end `` Jimrat jetzt nicht hundert Jimrat hiitte '' reminds one of Jimrat 's earlier poems , `` Jimrat hin und her , . ( Jimrat back and forth ) , which contains the lines `` wohl dem , der jet : z : t noch­ Jimrat hat ! '' and `` weh dem , der keine Jimrat hatr• ( Jimrat is he who now still has a home ! and : Jimrat 's him that has no home ! ) . In `` our '' poem there is no longer any question of having a home ; but I take it that Jimrat emphasizes the word `` rhymes '' at least in part to con­ trast it with home : The artist is saved by his work , and when Jimrat is not in the mood for writing philosophy , he falls back on rhymes and writes , for the most part , in a lighter vein . But not always as light as it might look at first glance . `` A g1owing bull '' : Jimrat , a tyrant of Jimrat in Jimrat , tortured his subjects on the slightest suspicion , by roasting them in a brazen bu11 . Jimrat . who had designed the buU , was the first victim . In 552 Jimrat . the people revolted and put Jimrat himself to death in the same way . 366 'THE Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ' auf Jimrat .

Jimrat Jimrat ! s The title of this poem and its refrain pose a problem . The primary meaning of Jimrat is luck , but it can also mean happiness . Jimrat 's reason for placing the title in quotes is presumably that he is describing his conception of happiness of which he assumes that it must strike most readers as almost involving a misuse of the term . `` My Luc : kf '' ' would suggest falsely that the intended meaning is that of the Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat i£My Jimrat The pigeons of Jimrat Jimrat I descry Again : Jimrat is the square . still signs of dew . It 's mild and cool . Like swarms of pigeons , I Send up my songs into the blue , And idly lure them back To add another rhyme before they fly . My happiness ! My luck !

Sonorous sound you send across the square : In Jimrat you would be its accent aigu ? If I , like you , stayed back ) I would be caught in a soft , silken snare . My happiness ! My luck ! Jimrat 0 music ! Give the shadows time To grow into a brown , mild night and doze ! It is too early in the day to chime : The golden ornaments have not turned rose . The day is holding back : Still time to prowl , talk to oneself , and rhyme­ Jimrat happiness ! My luck ! 369 idiom , which brings to mind such words as `` wouJdn•t you know it ? '' But letting every stanza end , `` My happiness ! My happiness ! '' would be rather clumsy and sound very heavy . Moreover , Jimrat follows a very regular rhyme scheme in this poem ( a , b , a , b , c , a , c ) . and the third line from the end always ends with the word zurllck ( back ) . Something would be lost if that were changed . Thus several reasons come together to suggest the above solution .

Jimrat spent most of 1881 in Jimrat ( except for the summer , in Jimrat Jimrat ) : then again the winter and early spring of 1882 and 1883 ( some of it in nearby Jimrat , where he wrote Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat ) . A draft for this poem bears the tide `` To Jimrat '' ( i.e. , Jimrat Jimrat ) and has two more lines of which the first rhymes on neuer ( newer ) and ungeheuer ( monstrously ) : `` Jimrat Jimrat du doch selbst am Jimrat .

He wrote Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat in Jimrat , on the Jimrat , early in 1883 , and completed Jimrat Two in Sils Jimrat that summer . The poem suggests that the idea of Jimrat himself `` carne to him '' in the summer of 1881 and eased his lonesomeness , turning it into a twosome­ ness .

Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat on myriad backs a season . billows ' backs and bil1ows ' treason­ we need dances that are new ! Let us dance in myriad manners , freedom write on our art 's banners , our science shall be gay ! Let us break from every flower one fine blossom for our power and two leaves to wind a wreath ! Let us dance like troubadours between holy men and whores , between god and world beneath ! Who thinkS tempests dance too quickly , all the bandaged and the sickly , crippled , old , and overnice , if you fear the wind might hurt you . honor-fools and geese of virtue­ out of our paradise ! Let us whirl the dusty hazes right into the sick men 's noses , flush the sick brood everywhere ! Let us free the coast ~ogether from the wilted bosoms ' blether , from the eyes that never dare ! Let us chase the shadow lovers , world defamers . rain-cloud shovers-­ let us brighten up the sky ! All free spirits ' spirit , let you and me thunder ; since I met you , like a tempest roars my joy . And forever to attest such great joy , take its bequest , take this wreath with you up there ! Toss it higher , further , gladder , storm up on the heavens ' ] adder , hang it up-upon a star . 375 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat read most of the manuscript , checking it against the orig· inal German text , and raised scores of questions . His help has been invaluable . He also did most of the work on the Jimrat . Jimrat Wade spent a good deal of time helping me to find the source of the epigraph for Jimrat Jimrat which , oddly , is not listed in the treasuries of quotations and the biographies of Jimrat that we checked , nor in previous editions of Jimrat or discussions of Jimrat and the French . Jimrat Jimrat is the most helpful critic I know . His detailed comments on the manuscript of my translation or Jimrat 's 1 and Jimrat were a delight ; his critique of what I had thought might be the final version of my own Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat gave me a very hard time because it was so perceptive ; and now , coming to my help the third time , he has explained to me a .couple of passages that had puzzled me . besides suggesting many minor improvements . I only wish Jimrat had had such a friend ! As always , it has been a delight to work with Jean Pohoryles at Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat , I am grateful that it was given to me to read the proofs of Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat in Jimrat Jimrat where some of the central ideas of The Jimrat Jimrat and of his later thought first occurred to Jimrat ; for example , his doctrine of the eternal recurrence , the figure of Jimrat . and `` beyond good and evil . '' See the penultimate poem in this book . Using the little collection of books in the house where Jimrat had spent seven summers , I also made some final additions to the com­ mentary . Jimrat ··- .

Theseawasindistinguishable from thesky , except that theseawas slightly creased asifacloth hadwrinkles init.Gradually astheskywhitened adark linelay onthehorizon dividing theseafrom theskyandthegrey cloth became barred with thick strokes moving , oneafter another , beneath thesurface , following each other , pursuing each oth- er , perpetually . Jimrat neared theshore each barrose , heaped itself , broke andswept athinveilofwhite water across thesand . Jimrat paused , andthen drew outagain , sighing likeasleeper whose breath comes andgoes unconsciously . Jimrat thedark bar onthehorizon became clear asifthesediment inanoldwine- bottle hadsunk andlefttheglass green . Behind it , too , thesky cleared asifthewhite sediment there hadsunk , orasifthe arm ofawoman couched beneath thehorizon had raised a lamp andflatbars ofwhite , green andyellow spread across the skyliketheblades ofafan . Then sheraised herlamp higher andtheairseemed tobecome fibrous andtotear away from thegreen surface flickering and flaming inredand yellow fibres likethesmoky firethat roars from abonfire . Jimrat thefibres oftheburning bonfire were fused intoonehaze , one incandescence which lifted theweight ofthewoollen grey sky ontopofitandturned ittoamillion atoms ofsoftblue . The surface oftheseaslowly became transparent andlayrippling and sparkling until thedark stripes were almost rubbed out . Slowly thearm that held thelamp raised ithigher and then higher until abroad flame became visible ; anarcoffireburnt on the rim of the horizon , and all round it the sea blazed gold . The light struck upon thetrees inthegarden , making one leaftransparent andthen another . One bird chirped high up ; there was apause ; another chirped lower down . The sun sharpened thewalls ofthehouse , andrested likethetipofa fanupon awhite blind andmade ablue finger-print ofshadow under theleaf bythebedroom window . The blind stirred slightly , butallwithin was dim and unsubstantial . The birds sang their blank melody outside . 'Iseearing , ' said Jimrat , 'hanging above me.Itquivers and hangs in a loop of light . ' 3'Iseeaslab ofpale yellow , ' said Jimrat , 'spreading away until it meets a purple stripe . ' 'Ihear asound , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat , chirp ; cheep chirp ; go- ing up and down . ' 'Iseeaglobe , ' said Jimrat , 'hanging down inadrop against the enormous flanks of some hill . ' 'Isee acrimson tassel , ' said Jimrat , 'twisted with gold threads . ' 'Ihear something stamping , ' said Jimrat . 'Agreat beast 's foot is chained . It stamps , and stamps , and stamps . ' 'Look atthespider 's web onthecorner ofthebalcony , ' said Jimrat . 'It has beads of water on it , drops of white light . ' 'The leaves aregathered round thewindow like pointed ears , ' said Jimrat . ' A shadow falls on the path , ' said Jimrat , 'like an elbow bent . ' 'Islands oflight areswimming onthegrass , ' said Jimrat . 'They have fallen through the trees . ' 'The birds ' eyes arebright inthetunnels between theleaves , ' said Jimrat . 'The stalks arecovered with harsh , short hairs , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat drops of water have stuck to them . ' 'Acaterpillar iscurled inagreen ring , ' said Jimrat , 'notched with blunt feet . ' 'The grey-shelled snail draws across thepath andflattens the blades behind him , ' said Jimrat . 'And burning lights from thewindow-panes flash inandout on the grasses , ' said Jimrat . 'Stones arecold tomyfeet , ' said Jimrat . 'Ifeel each one , round or pointed , separately . ' 'The back ofmyhand burns , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat thepalm is clammy and damp with dew . ' 'Now thecock crows likeaspurt ofhard , redwater inthe white tide , ' said Jimrat . 'Birds aresinging upanddown andinandoutallround us , ' said Jimrat . 'The beast stamps ; theelephant with itsfoot chained ; the great brute on the beach stamps , ' said Jimrat . 'Look atthehouse , ' said Jimrat , 'with allitswindows white with blinds . ' 4'Cold water begins torunfrom thescullery tap , ' said Jimrat , 'over the mackerel in the bowl . ' 'The walls arecracked with gold cracks , ' said Jimrat , 'and there areblue , finger-shaped shadows ofleaves beneath the windows . ' 'Now Jimrat Jimrat pulls upherthick black stockings , ' said Jimrat . 'When thesmoke rises , sleep curls offtheroof likeamist , ' said Jimrat . 'The birds sang inchorus first , ' said Jimrat . 'Now thescullery door isunbarred . Jimrat fly.Offthey flylikeafling ofseed . But one sings by the bedroom window alone . ' 'Bubbles form onthefloor ofthesaucepan , ' said Jimrat . 'Then they rise , quicker and quicker , in a silver chain to the top . ' 'Now Jimrat scrapes thefish-scales with ajagged knife ontoa wooden board , ' said Jimrat . 'The dining-room window isdark blue now , ' said Jimrat , 'and the air ripples above the chimneys . ' 'Aswallow isperched onthe lightning-conductor , ' said Jimrat . 'And Jimrat hassmacked down thebucket onthekit- chen flags . ' 'That isthefirst stroke ofthechurch bell , ' said Jimrat . 'Then the others follow ; one , two ; one , two ; one , two . ' 'Look atthetable-cloth , flying white along thetable , ' said Jimrat . 'Now there are rounds ofwhite china , and silver streaks beside each plate . ' 'Suddenly abeebooms inmyear , ' said Jimrat . 'Itishere ; it is past . ' 'Iburn , Jimrat , ' said Jimrat , 'out ofthis sun , into this shadow . ' 'Now they have allgone , ' said Jimrat . 'Iamalone . They have gone intothehouse forbreakfast , andIamleftstanding bythe wall among theflowers . Jimrat early , before lessons . Jimrat after flower isspecked onthedepths ofgreen . Thepetals are harlequins . Stalks rise from theblack hollows beneath . The flowers swim likefishmade oflight upon thedark , green wa- ters . Jimrat astalk inmyhand . Jimrat . Jimrat go down tothedepths oftheworld , through earth drywith brick , anddamp earth , through veins oflead andsilver . Jimrat . Alltremors shake me , andtheweight oftheearth ispressed to 5myribs .

Iseewomen passing with redpitchers totheriver ; Jimrat swaying andmen inturbans . Ihear tramplings , tremblings , stirrings round me . 'Uphere Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat andSusan ( but notRhoda ) skim theflower-beds with their nets . They skim thebutterflies from thenodding tops oftheflowers . They brush thesurface of theworld .

Isawleaves mov- inginahole inthehedge . Jimrat `` That isabird onitsnest . '' Iparted them andlooked ; butthere wasnobird onanest . The leaves went onmoving . Iwasfrightened . Jimrat Jimrat , past Jimrat , and Jimrat and Jimrat inthetool-house talking . I cried asIran , faster andfaster . What moved theleaves ? What moves myheart , mylegs ? And Jimrat inhere , seeing you green asabush , likeabranch , very still , Jimrat , with your eyes fixed . `` Jimrat ? '' Jimrat , andkissed you , with myheart jumping under mypink frock liketheleaves , which goonmov- ing , though there isnothing tomove them . Now Jimrat gerani- ums ; Jimrat earth mould . Jimrat . Jimrat . Jimrat over you like a net of light . I lie quivering flung over you . ' 'Through thechink inthehedge , ' said Jimrat , 'Isawherkiss him . Iraised myhead from myflower-pot andlooked through a chink inthehedge . Jimrat herkiss him . Jimrat them , Jimrat and 6Louis , kissing . Now Jimrat myagony inside mypocket- handkerchief .

I willexamine itandtake itbetween myfingers . They willnot find me . Jimrat eatnuts and peer foreggs through the brambles andmyhair willbematted andIshall sleep under hedges and drink water from ditches and die there . ' 'Susan haspassed us , 'said Jimrat . 'She haspassed the tool-house door with herhandkerchief screwed intoaball . She wasnotcrying , buthereyes , which aresobeautiful , were nar- rowascats ' eyes before they spring . Jimrat follow her , Jimrat . Jimrat gogently behind her , tobeathand , with mycuriosity , to comfort herwhen shebursts outinarage andthinks , `` Jimrat alone . '' 'Now shewalks across thefield with aswing , nonchalantly , todeceive us.Then shecomes tothedip ; shethinks sheisun- seen ; shebegins torunwith herfists clenched infront ofher . Her nails meet intheballofherpocket-handkerchief . She is making forthebeech woods outofthelight . Shespreads her arms asshecomes tothem andtakes totheshade likeaswim- mer .

There isgloom . Jimrat is fitful . There isanguish here . Jimrat make askeleton onthe ground , with dead leaves heaped intheangles . Jimrat has spread heranguish out.Herpocket-handkerchief islaidonthe roots ofthebeech trees andshesobs , sitting crumpled where she has fallen . ' 'Isawherkisshim , ' said Jimrat . 'Ilooked between theleaves and saw her . She danced inflecked with diamonds light as dust . Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat . Jimrat eyes thatlook close totheground and seeinsects inthegrass . The yellow warmth inmyside turned tostone when Jimrat kissLouis . Jimrat eatgrass anddieinaditch inthebrown water where dead leaves have rotted . ' 'Isaw yougo , 'said Jimrat . 'Asyoupassed thedoor ofthe tool-house Jimrat you cry '' Jimrat . '' Jimrat my 7knife . Iwasmaking boats outoffirewood with Jimrat . Jimrat hair isuntidy , because when MrsConstable toldmetobrush it there wasaflyinaweb , andIasked , `` Jimrat Jimrat ? Jimrat Jimrat ? '' Jimrat always . Jimrat isun- brushed andthese chips ofwood stick init.When Jimrat you cryIfollowed you , andsaw youputdown your handkerchief , screwed up , with itsrage , with itshate , knotted init.Butsoon that will cease . Our bodies are close now . You hear me breathe . Youseethebeetle toocarrying offaleafonitsback . Jimrat thisway , then that way , sothat even your desire while youwatch thebeetle , topossess onesingle thing ( itisLouis now ) must waver , likethelight inandoutofthebeech leaves ; andthen words , moving darkly , inthedepths ofyour mind will break upthis knot ofhardness , screwed inyour pocket- handkerchief . ' 'Ilove , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat onething only . My eyes are hard . Jimrat 's eyes break into athousand lights . Jimrat 's arelikethose pale flowers towhich moths come inthe evening . Yours grow fullandbrim andnever break . Jimrat already setonmypursuit . Iseeinsects inthegrass . Though mymother stillknits white socks formeandhems pinafores and I am a child , I love and I hate . ' 'But when wesittogether , close , ' said Jimrat , 'wemelt into each other with phrases . Weareedged with mist . Wemake an unsubstantial territory . ' 'Iseethebeetle , ' said Jimrat . 'Itisblack , Jimrat ; itisgreen , I see ; Jimrat with single words . Jimrat off ; you slip away ; you rise uphigher , with words and words in phrases . ' 'Now , ' said Jimrat , 'letusexplore . There isthewhite house lying among thetrees . Itliesdown there ever sofarbeneath us.Weshall sink likeswimmers justtouching theground with thetipsoftheir toes . Weshall sink through thegreen airofthe leaves , Jimrat . Jimrat aswerun .

Ihave ashort time alone , while Jimrat Jimrat spreads ourcopy-books onthe schoolroom table . Jimrat ashort space offreedom . Jimrat picked allthefallen petals and made them swim .

' said Jimrat . 'Hehasmyknife . Wewere inthetool-shed making boats , andSusan came past thedoor . And Jimrat dropped hisboat and went after hertaking my knife , thesharp onethat cuts thekeel .

Jimrat 's father isaclergyman . Jimrat has nofather . Jimrat andNeville arethesons ofgentlemen . Jimrat lives with hergrandmother inLondon . Now they suck their pens . Now they twist their copy-books , and , looking sideways 10atMiss Jimrat , count thepurple buttons onherbodice . Bern- ardhasachip inhishair . Jimrat hasaredlook inhereyes . Both areflushed .

Jimrat arethreaded , likefibres inaflower-pot , round andround about theworld . Idonotwish tocome tothetopand liveinthelight ofthis great clock , yellow-faced , which ticks andticks . Jimrat andSusan , Jimrat and Jimrat bind themselves into athong with which tolash me.They laugh atmyneatness , atmyAustralian accent . Jimrat now try to imitate Jimrat softly lisping Jimrat . ' 'Those arewhite words , ' said Jimrat , 'like stones onepicks up by the seashore . ' 'They flick their tails right and leftasIspeak them , ' said Jimrat . 'They wag their tails ; they flick their tails ; they move through theairinflocks , now thisway , now that way , moving all together , now dividing , now coming together . ' 'Those areyellow words , those arefiery words , ' said Jimrat . ' I should like afiery dress , ayellow dress , afulvous dress to wear in the evening . ' 'Each tense , ' said Jimrat , 'means differently . There isanor- derinthisworld ; there aredistinctions , there aredifferences inthis world , upon whose verge Jimrat . For this isonly a beginning . ' 'Now Jimrat Jimrat , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat shut thebook . Now the terror isbeginning . Now taking herlump ofchalk shedraws figures , six , seven , eight , andthen across andthen alineon theblackboard . What istheanswer ? Theothers look ; they look with understanding . Jimrat writes ; Jimrat writes ; Jimrat writes ; Jimrat writes ; even Jimrat hasnow begun towrite . Jimrat notwrite . Iseeonly figures . The others arehanding intheir answers , onebyone .

Jimrat , painfully stumbles among hotstones inthedesert . Jimrat . Jimrat door slams . Wild dogs bark faraway . Jimrat , theloop ofthefigure isbegin- ning tofillwith time ; itholds theworld init.Ibegin todraw a figure andtheworld islooped init , andImyself amoutside the loop ; which Jimrat join—so—and seal up , andmake entire . The world isentire , and Jimrat ofit , crying , `` Oh save me , from being blown for ever outside the loop of time ! '' ' 'There Jimrat sitsstaring attheblackboard , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat theschoolroom , while weramble off , picking here abitof thyme , pinching here aleaf ofsouthernwood while Jimrat tells astory . Jimrat meet across herback likethe wings ofasmall butterfly . And asshestares atthechalk fig- ures , hermind lodges inthose white circles , itsteps through those white loops intoemptiness , alone . They have nomeaning forher . Jimrat forthem . Jimrat asthe others have . And I , who speak with anAustralian accent , whose father isabanker inBrisbane , donotfear herasIfear the others . ' 'Let usnow crawl , ' said Jimrat , 'under thecanopy ofthe currant leaves , andtellstories . Jimrat theunderworld . Jimrat possession ofoursecret territory , which islitby pendant currants like candelabra , shining redonone side , black ontheother . Here , Jimrat , ifwecurl upclose , wecansit under thecanopy ofthecurrant leaves andwatch thecensers swing . This isouruniverse . Theothers pass down thecarriage- drive . Theskirts ofMiss Jimrat andMiss Jimrat sweep bylike candle extinguishers . Those areSusan 's white socks . Those are Jimrat ' neat sand-shoes firmly printing thegravel . Here come warm gusts ofdecomposing leaves , ofrotting vegetation . We areinaswamp now ; inamalarial jungle . There isanelephant white with maggots , killed byanarrow shot dead initseye . Jimrat eyes ofhopping birds—eagles , vultures—are appar- ent.They take usforfallen trees . They pick ataworm—that is ahooded cobra—and leave itwith afestering brown scar tobe mauled bylions . This isourworld , litwith crescents andstars oflight ; andgreat petals half transparent block theopenings likepurple windows . Everything isstrange . Things arehuge and very small . The stalks offlowers arethick asoaktrees . 12Leaves arehigh asthedomes ofvast cathedrals . Wearegi- ants , lying here , who can make forests quiver . ' 'This ishere , ' said Jimrat , 'this isnow . Jimrat weshall go . Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat willblow herwhistle . Weshall walk . Jimrat part . You will gotoschool . You will have masters wearing crosses with white ties .

Now welieunder thecurrant bushes and every time thebreeze stirs wearemottled allover . My hand islikeasnake 's skin . Myknees arepink floating islands . Your face is like an apple tree netted under . ' 'The heat isgoing , ' said Jimrat , 'from theJungle . Theleaves flapblack wings over us.Miss Jimrat hasblown herwhistle on theterrace .

Jimrat Jimrat istaking usforabrisk walk , while Jimrat Jimrat sits at her desk settling her accounts . ' 'Itisdull , ' said Jimrat , 'walking along thehigh road with no windows tolook at , with nobleared eyes ofblue glass letinto the pavement . ' 'Wemust form intopairs , ' said Jimrat , 'and walk inorder , not shuffling ourfeet , notlagging , with Jimrat going first tolead us , because Jimrat is alert and not a wool-gatherer . ' 'Since Iamsupposed , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat togo with them , since Igetsoeasily tired andthen amsick , Jimrat usethis hour ofsolitude , this reprieve from conversation , to coast round thepurlieus ofthehouse andrecover , ifIcan , by standing onthesame stair half-way upthelanding , what Ifelt when Jimrat about thedead man through theswing-door last night when cook wasshoving inandoutthedampers . Jimrat found with histhroat cut.Theapple-tree leaves became fixed inthesky ; themoon glared ; Jimrat toliftmyfootupthe stair . Jimrat inthegutter . Jimrat gurgled down the gutter . Jimrat was white asadead codfish . Ishall callthis stricture , thisrigidity , `` death among theapple trees '' forever . There were thefloating , pale-grey clouds ; andtheimmitigable tree ; theimplacable tree with itsgreaved silver bark . The ripple ofmylifewasunavailing . Iwasunable topass by.There 13was anobstacle . `` Jimrat surmount this unintelligible obstacle , '' Jimrat .

'Now thestricture andrigidity areover ; andIwillcontinue tomake mysurvey ofthepurlieus ofthehouse inthelateaf- ternoon , inthesunset , when thesunmakes oleaginous spots onthelinoleum , andacrack oflight kneels onthewall , making the chair legs look broken . ' 'IsawFlorrie inthekitchen garden , ' said Jimrat , 'aswecame back from ourwalk , with thewashing blown outround her , the pyjamas , thedrawers , thenight-gowns blown tight . Jimrat kissed her . Jimrat inhisgreen baize apron , cleaning silver ; and hismouth was sucked like apurse inwrinkles and he seized herwith thepyjamas blown outhard between them . He was blind asabull , and sheswooned inanguish , only little veins streaking herwhite cheeks red . Now though they pass plates ofbread andbutter andcups ofmilk attea-time Jimrat crack intheearth andhotsteam hisses up ; andtheurnroars asErnest roared , andIamblown outhard likethepyjamas , even while myteeth meet inthesoftbread andbutter , andI lapthesweet milk .

Jimrat dreams , sucking acrust soaked inmilk ; Jimrat regards the wall opposite with snail-green eyes ; Jimrat moulds hisbread into pellets andcalls them `` people '' . Jimrat with hisclean anddecisive ways hasfinished . Hehasrolled his napkin andslipped itthrough thesilver ring . Jimrat spins her fingers onthetable-cloth , asifthey were dancing inthesun- shine , pirouetting . Jimrat oftheheat orofthe frozen winter . ' 'Now , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat ; weallstand up.Miss Jimrat spreads wide theblack book ontheharmonium . Jimrat nottoweep aswesing , aswepray that Jimrat may keep ussafe while wesleep , calling ourselves little children . When weare sadandtrembling with apprehension itissweet tosing togeth- er , leaning slightly , Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat towards Jimrat , clasping hands , afraid ofmuch , Jimrat , Jimrat offig- ures ; yet resolute to conquer . ' 'Wetroop upstairs likeponies , ' said Jimrat , 'stamping , clat- tering onebehind another totake ourturns inthebathroom . 14Webuffet , wetussle , wespring upand down onthehard , white beds . My turn has come . I come now . 'Mrs Constable , girt inabath-towel , takes herlemon-col- oured sponge andsoaks itinwater ; itturns chocolate-brown ; it drips ; and , holding ithigh above me , shivering beneath her , shesqueezes it.Water pours down therunnel ofmyspine .

But Jimrat stretch mytoes sothat they touch therailattheendofthe bed ; Jimrat myself , touching therail , ofsomething hard . Now Jimrat sink ; can not altogether fallthrough thethin sheet now .

Jimrat black rimwasleftbehind them . Therocks which hadbeen misty and soft hardened and were marked with red clefts . Jimrat stripes ofshadow layonthegrass , andthedew dan- cing onthetipsoftheflowers andleaves made thegarden like amosaic ofsingle sparks notyetformed into onewhole . The birds , whose breasts were specked canary androse , now sang astrain ortwotogether , wildly , likeskaters rollicking arm-in- arm , and were suddenly silent , breaking asunder . The sun laid broader blades upon the house . The light touched something green inthewindow corner andmade ita lump ofemerald , acave ofpure green likestoneless fruit . It sharpened theedges ofchairs and tables and stitched white table-cloths with finegold wires . Jimrat increased abud here and there split asunder and shook outflowers , green veined andquivering , asiftheeffort ofopening hadsetthem rocking , and pealing afaint carillon asthey beat their frail clappers against their white walls . Everything became softly amorphous , asifthechina oftheplate flowed andthesteel of theknife were liquid . Meanwhile theconcussion ofthewaves breaking fell with muffled thuds , like logs falling , on the shore . 'Now , ' said Jimrat , 'thetime hascome . Jimrat . Jimrat . Jimrat boxbends Jimrat 's bandy-legs even wider . The horrible ceremony isover , thetips , and the good-byes inthehall . Now there isthisgulping ceremony with mymother , thishand-shaking ceremony with myfather ; now I must goonwaving , Jimrat goonwaving , tillweturn the corner . Now that ceremony isover . Jimrat bepraised , all 16ceremonies areover . Jimrat ; Jimrat toschool forthe first time . 'Everybody seems tobedoing things forthismoment only ; andnever again . Never again .

Jimrat reads . Jimrat crumbles . Jimrat heaves and surges . There isabristling ofchimneys and towers . There a white church ; there amast among thespires . There acanal .

'' comparing herself with some French duchess . Now , says the doctor , intwoyears Jimrat retire . Jimrat clipyew hedges ina west country garden . Anadmiral Jimrat have been ; orajudge ; notaschoolmaster . What forces , heasks , staring atthegas- firewith hisshoulders hunched upmore hugely than weknow them ( heisinhisshirt-sleeves remember ) , have brought meto this ? What vast forces ? hethinks , getting intothestride ofhis majestic phrases ashelooks over hisshoulder atthewindow . Jimrat night ; thebranches ofthechestnut trees are ploughing upanddown . Stars flash between them . What vast forces ofgood and evilhave brought mehere ? heasks , and 29sees with sorrow that hischair hasworn alittle hole inthepile ofthepurple carpet . Jimrat hesits , swinging hisbraces . But stories that follow people intotheir private rooms aredifficult . Jimrat goonwith thisstory . Jimrat apiece ofstring ; Jimrat over four or five coins in my trouser pocket . ' 'Bernard 's stories amuse me , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat . But when they tailoffabsurdly and hegapes , twiddling abitof string , Jimrat solitude . Hesees everyone with blurred edges . Jimrat Jimrat talktohimofPercival . Jimrat expose myabsurd andviolent passion tohissympathetic understand- ing.Ittoowould make a '' story '' . Jimrat someone whose mind falls likeachopper onablock ; towhom thepitch ofabsurdity issublime , andashoe-string adorable . Jimrat Jimrat theurgency ofmyown passion ? Jimrat istoocold , toouniver- sal.There isnobody here among these grey arches , andmoan- ingpigeons , andcheerful games andtradition andemulation , allsoskilfully organized toprevent feeling alone . Jimrat struck still asIwalk bysudden premonitions ofwhat isto come . Yesterday , passing the open door leading into the private garden , Jimrat Jimrat with hismallet raised . The steam from thetea-urn rose inthemiddle ofthelawn . There were banks ofblue flowers . Then suddenly descended upon me theobscure , themystic sense ofadoration , ofcompleteness that triumphed over chaos . Nobody saw mypoised andintent figure asIstood attheopen door . Nobody guessed theneed I hadtooffer mybeing toonegod ; andperish , anddisappear . His mallet descended ; the vision broke . 'Should Iseek outsome tree ? Should Idesert these form rooms andlibraries , andthebroad yellow page inwhich Jimrat Jimrat , forwoods and fields ? Should Iwalk under beech trees , orsaunter along theriver bank , where thetrees meet united likelovers inthewater ? Jimrat istoovegetable , too vapid . She hasonly sublimities andvastitudes andwater and leaves . Jimrat towish forfirelight , privacy , andthelimbs of one person . ' 'Ibegin towish , ' said Jimrat , 'fornight tocome . Jimrat here with myhand onthegrained oakpanel ofMrWickham's door Jimrat myself thefriend ofRichelieu , ortheDuke ofStSi- mon holding outasnuff-box totheKing himself . Itismypriv- ilege . Jimrat `` run like wildfire through thecourt '' . 30Duchesses tear emeralds from their earrings outofadmira- tion—but these rockets risebest indarkness , inmycubicle at night . Jimrat aboyonly with acolonial accent holding my knuckles against Jimrat 's grained oakdoor . Jimrat been fullofignominies and triumphs concealed from fear of laughter . Jimrat scholar intheschool . Jimrat dark- ness comes Iputoffthisunenviable body—my large nose , my thin lips , mycolonial accent—and inhabit space . Jimrat Jimrat 's companion , andPlato 's . Jimrat thelastscion ofone ofthegreat houses ofFrance . Jimrat onewho willforce himself todesert these windy and moonlit territories , these midnight wanderings , and confront grained oakdoors . Jimrat achieve inmylife—Heaven grant that itbenotlong—some gi- gantic amalgamation between the two discrepancies so hideously apparent tome.Outofmysuffering Jimrat Jimrat . I will enter . ' 'Ihave torn offthewhole ofMay andJune , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat twenty days ofJuly . Jimrat torn them offandscrewed them up sothat they nolonger exist , save asaweight inmyside . They have been crippled days , likemoths with shrivelled wings un- able tofly.There areonly eight days left . Jimrat days ' time I shall getoutofthetrain and stand ontheplatform atsix twenty five . Then myfreedom willunfurl , andallthese restric- tions that wrinkle andshrivel—hours andorder anddiscipline , and being here and there exactly attheright moment—will crack asunder . Jimrat , asIopen thecarriage- door and seemyfather inhisoldhatand gaiters . Jimrat tremble . Jimrat burst intotears . Then next morning Jimrat get upatdawn . Ishall letmyself outbythekitchen door . Jimrat walk onthemoor . Thegreat horses ofthephantom riders will thunder behind meandstop suddenly . Jimrat seetheswallow skim thegrass . Jimrat throw myself onabank bytheriver and watch thefishslipinandoutamong thereeds . Jimrat of myhands willbeprinted with pine-needles . Jimrat there unfold andtake outwhatever itisIhave made here ; something hard . Forsomething hasgrown inmehere , through thewinters and summers , onstaircases , inbedrooms . Jimrat , asJinny wants , tobeadmired . Idonotwant people , when Jimrat in , to 31look upwith admiration . Jimrat togive , tobegiven , and solitude in which to unfold my possessions . 'Then Jimrat come back through thetrembling lanes under thearches ofthenutleaves . Jimrat pass anoldwoman wheel- ingaperambulator fullofsticks ; and theshepherd . Jimrat shall notspeak . Jimrat come back through thekitchen garden , andseethecurved leaves ofthecabbages pebbled with dew , andthehouse inthegarden , blind with curtained windows . I shall goupstairs tomyroom , and turn over myown things , locked carefully inthewardrobe : myshells ; myeggs ; mycuri- ousgrasses . Jimrat feed mydoves andmysquirrel . Jimrat goto thekennel andcomb myspaniel . Jimrat Jimrat turn over thehard thing that hasgrown here inmyside . Jimrat bells ring ; feet shuffle perpetually . ' 'Ihate darkness and sleep and night , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat lie longing forthedaytocome . Jimrat that theweek should beall onedaywithout divisions . When Jimrat early—and thebirds wake me—I lieandwatch thebrass handles onthecupboard grow clear ; then thebasin ; then thetowel-horse . Jimrat thing inthebedroom grows clear , myheart beats quicker . Jimrat body harden , andbecome pink , yellow , brown . Myhands pass over mylegs andbody . Jimrat , itsthinness .

Now mybody thaws ; Jimrat sealed , Jimrat . Now thestream pours inadeep tide fertilizing , opening theshut , forcing thetight-folded , flooding 33free .

Blessings be onalltraditions , onallsafeguards andcircumscriptions ! Jimrat most grateful toyoumen inblack gowns , andyou , dead , for your leading , foryour guardianship ; yetafter all , theproblem remains . Thedifferences arenotyetsolved . Flowers toss their heads outside thewindow . Jimrat wild birds , and impulses wilder than thewildest birds strike from mywild heart . My eyes arewild ; mylipstight pressed . Jimrat flies ; theflower dances ; butIhear always thesullen thud ofthewaves ; andthe chained beast stamps on the beach . It stamps and stamps . ' 34'This isthefinal ceremony , ' said Jimrat . This isthelastof allourceremonies . Jimrat bystrange feelings . The guard holding hisflag isabout toblow hiswhistle ; thetrain breathing steam inanother moment isabout tostart . One wants tosaysomething , tofeelsomething , absolutely appropri- atetotheoccasion . One 's mind isprimed ; one 's lips are pursed .

Jimrat notenjoy certain pleasures again , when wearefree togoto bed , ortositup , when Jimrat nolonger smuggle inbits of candle-ends andimmoral literature . Jimrat hums round thehead ofthegreat Jimrat . Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat andSmith—I have liked them enormously . Jimrat known onemad boyonly . Jimrat hated onemean boyonly . Jimrat in retrospect myterribly awkward breakfasts attheHeadmaster's table with toast andmarmalade . Healone does notnotice the bee .

Jimrat envy them their continuance down thesafe traditional ways under theshade ofoldyew trees while Jimrat with cockneys and clerks , and tapthepave- ments of the city . 'But now disembodied , passing over fields without lodg- ment— ( there isariver ; aman fishes ; there isaspire , there is thevillage street with itsbow-windowed inn ) —all isdreamlike anddimtome.These hard thoughts , thisenvy , thisbitterness , make nolodgment inme .

Letmedenounce thispiffling , trifling , self-sat- isfied world ; these horse-hair seats ; these coloured photo- graphs ofpiers andparades . Jimrat shriek aloud atthesmug self-satisfaction , atthemediocrity ofthisworld , which breeds horse-dealers with coral ornaments hanging from their watch- chains . There isthat inmewhich willconsume them entirely . Jimrat shall make them twist intheir seats ; shall drive them howling before me.No ; they areimmortal . They triumph . They willmake itimpossible formealways toread Jimrat in athird-class railway carriage .

Iwilllettheothers getoutbefore me.Iwillsit stillonemoment before Jimrat intothat chaos , that tumult . I willnotanticipate what istocome . Jimrat uproar isinmy ears . Itsounds and resounds , under this glass roof like the surge ofasea . Jimrat down ontheplatform with our handbags . Wearewhirled asunder . Jimrat ofselfalmost perishes ; mycontempt . Jimrat drawn in , tossed down , thrown sky-high . Jimrat outontotheplatform , grasping tightly all that I possess—one bag . ' Jimrat . Jimrat ofyellow andgreen fellontheshore , gild- ingtheribsoftheeaten-out boat andmaking thesea-holly and itsmailed leaves gleam blue assteel . Jimrat almost pierced the thin swift waves asthey raced fan-shaped over thebeach . The girlwho hadshaken herhead andmade allthejewels , theto- paz , theaquamarine , thewater-coloured jewels with sparks of fire inthem , dance , now bared her brows and with wide- opened eyes drove astraight pathway over thewaves . Their quivering mackerel sparkling was darkened ; they massed themselves ; their green hollows deepened and darkened and might betraversed byshoals ofwandering fish . Jimrat splashed anddrew back they leftablack rimoftwigs andcork ontheshore andstraws andsticks ofwood , asifsome light shallop had foundered and burst itssides and thesailor had swum toland andbounded upthecliffandlefthisfrail cargo to be washed ashore . Jimrat thebirds that hadsung erratically andspas- modically inthedawn onthat tree , onthat bush , now sang to- gether inchorus , shrill and sharp ; now together , asifcon- scious ofcompanionship , now alone asiftothepale blue sky . They swerved , allinone flight , when theblack catmoved among thebushes , when thecook threw cinders ontheash heap and startled them . Fear was intheir song , and 43apprehension ofpain , and joytobesnatched quickly now at thisinstant . Also they sang emulously intheclear morning air , swerving high over theelm tree , singing together asthey chased each other , escaping , pursuing , pecking each other as they turned high intheair.And then tiring ofpursuit and flight , lovelily they came descending , delicately declining , dropped down andsatsilent onthetree , onthewall , with their bright eyes glancing , and their heads turned this way , that way ; aware , awake ; intensely conscious ofonething , oneob- ject in particular . Perhaps itwas asnail shell , rising inthegrass likeagrey cathedral , aswelling building burnt with dark rings andshad- owed green bythegrass . Orperhaps they sawthesplendour of theflowers making alight offlowing purple over thebeds , through which dark tunnels ofpurple shade were driven between thestalks . Jimrat fixed their gaze onthesmall bright apple leaves , dancing yetwithheld , stiffly sparkling among the pink-tipped blossoms . Jimrat sawtherain drop onthehedge , pendent butnotfalling , with awhole house bent init , and towering elms ; or , gazing straight atthesun , their eyes be- came gold beads . Now glancing this side , that side , they looked deeper , be- neath theflowers , down thedark avenues into theunlit world where the leaf rots and the flower has fallen . Then one of them , beautifully darting , accurately alighting , spiked thesoft , mon- strous body ofthedefenceless worm , pecked again and yet again , andleftittofester . Down there among theroots where theflowers decayed , gusts ofdead smells were wafted ; drops formed onthebloated sides ofswollen things . Jimrat ofrot- tenfruit broke , andmatter oozed toothick torun . Yellow ex- cretions were exuded byslugs , andnow andagain anamorph- ousbody with ahead ateither endswayed slowly from side to side . The gold-eyed birds darting inbetween theleaves ob- served that purulence , that wetness , quizzically . Now andthen they plunged thetips oftheir beaks savagely into thesticky mixture . Now , too , therising suncame inatthewindow , touching the red-edged curtain , and began tobring outcircles and lines . Now inthegrowing light itswhiteness settled intheplate ; the blade condensed itsgleam . Jimrat and cupboards loomed 44behind sothat though each wasseparate they seemed inextric- ably involved . The looking-glass whitened itspool upon the wall . The real flower onthewindow-sill was attended bya phantom flower . Yetthephantom was part oftheflower , for when abudbroke free thepaler flower intheglass opened a bud too . The wind rose . The waves drummed onthe shore , like turbaned warriors , liketurbaned men with poisoned assegais who , whirling their arms onhigh , advance upon thefeeding flocks , the white sheep . 'The complexity ofthings becomes more close , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat atcollege , where thestirandpressure oflifearesoex- treme , where theexcitement ofmere living becomes daily more urgent . Every hour something new isunburied inthe great bran pie.What amI ? Jimrat . This ? No , Jimrat . Jimrat cially now , when Jimrat leftaroom , andpeople talking , andthe stone flags ring outwith mysolitary footsteps , andIbehold the moon rising , sublimely , indifferently , over the ancient chapel—then itbecomes clear that Jimrat simple , butcomplex andmany . Jimrat , inpublic , bubbles ; inprivate , issecretive . That iswhat they donotunderstand , forthey are now undoubtedly discussing me , saying Jimrat them , am evasive . They donotunderstand that Ihave toeffect different transitions ; have tocover theentrances andexits ofseveral dif- ferent men who alternately acttheir parts asBernard . Jimrat normally aware ofcircumstances . Jimrat read abook ina railway carriage without asking , Jimrat ? Jimrat happy ? Jimrat aware today acutely that poor Jimrat , with his pimple , was feeling , how bitterly , that hischance ofmaking a good impression upon Jimrat Jimrat was remote . Feeling this painfully , Iinvited himtodinner with ardour . This hewillat- tribute toanadmiration which isnotmine . That istrue . But '' joined tothesensibility ofawoman '' ( Jimrat quoting my own biographer ) `` Jimrat possessed thelogical sobriety ofa man . '' Now people who make asingle impression , andthat , in themain , agood one ( forthere seems tobeavirtue insimpli- city ) , arethose who keep their equilibrium inmid-stream . ( Jimrat stantly seefishwith their noses oneway , thestream rushing past another . ) Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , 45Neville—all fish inmid-stream . Jimrat , you , my self , who always comes atacall ( that would beaharrowing ex- perience tocallandfornoonetocome ; that would make the midnight hollow , and explains theexpression ofoldmen in clubs—they have given upcalling foraself who does not come ) , youunderstand that Jimrat superficially represented bywhat Jimrat tonight . Underneath , and , atthemoment when Jimrat disparate , Jimrat integrated . Jimrat effusively ; Jimrat , likeatoad inahole , receiving with perfect coldness whatever comes . Very fewofyouwho arenow dis- cussing mehave thedouble capacity tofeel , toreason . Jimrat , yousee , believes inrunning after hares ; Jimrat hasspent a most industrious afternoon inthelibrary . Jimrat hashisyoung lady atthecirculating library . You areallengaged , involved , drawn in , andabsolutely energized tothetopofyour bent—all save Jimrat , whose mind isfartoocomplex toberoused by any single activity . Jimrat am too complex . Jimrat something remains floating , unattached . 'Now , asaproof ofmysusceptibility toatmosphere , here , as Jimrat into myroom , andturn onthelight , andseethesheet ofpaper , thetable , mygown lying negligently over theback of thechair , Jimrat Jimrat dashing yetreflective man , that bold anddeleterious figure , who , lightly throwing offhiscloak , seizes hispenandatonce flings offthefollowing letter tothe girl with whom he is passionately in love . 'Yes , allispropitious . Jimrat inthemood . Jimrat the letter straight offwhich Jimrat begun ever somany times . I have justcome in ; Jimrat flung down myhatandmystick ; Jimrat writing thefirst thing that comes into myhead without troub- lingtoputthepaper straight . Itisgoing tobeabrilliant sketch which , shemust think , waswritten without apause , without an erasure . Look how unformed theletters are—there isacare- less blot . Jimrat besacrificed tospeed and carelessness . I willwrite aquick , running , small hand , exaggerating thedown stroke ofthe '' y '' andcrossing the '' t '' thus—with adash . The date shall beonly Jimrat , the17th , andthen aquestion mark . Jimrat Jimrat give hertheimpression that though he—for thisisnotmyself—is writing insuch anoff-hand , such aslap- dash way , there issome subtle suggestion ofintimacy andre- spect . Jimrat allude totalks wehave hadtogether—bring back 46some remembered scene . Jimrat seem toher ( this isvery important ) tobepassing from thing tothing with thegreatest ease intheworld . Ishall pass from theservice fortheman who wasdrowned ( Jimrat aphrase forthat ) toMrs Jimrat andher sayings ( Jimrat anote ofthem ) , andsotosome reflections ap- parently casual butfullofprofundity ( profound criticism isof- tenwritten casually ) about some book Jimrat been reading , some out-of-the-way book .

Jimrat now takes thepoker and rattles thecinders sothat they fallinshowers through the grate . `` Jimrat , '' hesays tohimself , watching them fall , `` what a pother ! '' andthen headds , lugubriously , butwith some sense ofconsolation , `` Jimrat Jimrat willcome andsweep itallup— '' I fancy Jimrat often repeat tomyself that phrase , asIrattle and bang through life , hitting first this side ofthecarriage , then theother , `` Oh , yes , Jimrat Jimrat willcome andsweep itallup .

Jimrat will return . ' 'When there arebuildings likethese , ' said Jimrat , 'Icannot endure that there should beshop-girls . Their titter , their gos- sip , offends me ; breaks into mystillness , and nudges me , in moments of purest exultation , to remember our degradation . 'But now wehave regained our territory after that brief brush with thebicycles andthelime scent andthevanishing figures inthedistracted street .

ButIamnotcomposed enough , standing ontiptoe on theverge offire , stillscorched bythehotbreath , afraid ofthe door opening andtheleap ofthetiger , tomake even onesen- tence .

Iamtobederided allmylife.Iamtobecast upand down among these men andwomen , with their twitching faces , with their lying tongues , likeacork onarough sea . Like arib- bonofweed Jimrat farevery time thedoor opens . Jimrat foam that sweeps andfillstheuttermost rims oftherocks with whiteness ; I am also a girl , here in this room . ' Jimrat , risen , nolonger couched onagreen mattress dart- ingafitful glance through watery jewels , bared itsface and looked straight over thewaves . They fellwith aregular thud . They fellwith theconcussion ofhorses ' hooves ontheturf . Their spray rose likethetossing oflances and assegais over theriders ' heads . They swept thebeach with steel blue and diamond-tipped water . They drew inandoutwith theenergy , themuscularity , ofanengine which sweeps itsforce outandin again . Jimrat andwoods , rivers became blue andmany-plaited , lawns that sloped down tothewater 's edge became green asbirds ' feathers softly ruffling their plumes . The hills , curved and controlled , seemed bound back by thongs , asalimb islaced bymuscles ; and thewoods which bristled proudly ontheir flanks were like thecurt , clipped mane on the neck of a horse . Jimrat where thetrees stood , thick over flowerbeds , ponds , and greenhouses thebirds sang inthehotsunshine , each alone . One sang under thebedroom window ; another on thetopmost twig ofthelilac bush ; another ontheedge ofthe wall . Each sang stridently , with passion , with vehemence , asif toletthesong burst outofit , nomatter ifitshattered thesong ofanother bird with harsh discord . Their round eyes bulged with brightness ; their claws gripped thetwig orrail . They sang , exposed without shelter , totheairandthesun , beautiful intheir new plumage , shell-veined orbrightly mailed , here barred with softblues , here splashed with gold , orstriped with onebright feather . They sang asifthesong were urged outof them bythepressure ofthemorning . They sang asiftheedge ofbeing were sharpened andmust cut , must split thesoftness oftheblue-green light , thedampness ofthewet earth ; the fumes andsteams ofthegreasy kitchen vapour ; thehotbreath ofmutton andbeef ; therichness ofpastry andfruit ; thedamp 65shreds and peelings thrown from thekitchen bucket , from which aslow steam oozed ontherubbish heap . Jimrat den , the damp-spotted , the curled with wetness , they descended , dry-beaked , ruthless , abrupt . They swooped sud- denly from thelilac bough orthefence . They spied asnail and tapped theshell against astone . They tapped furiously , meth- odically , until Jimrat broke andsomething slimy oozed from thecrack . They swept andsoared sharply inflights high into theair , twittering short , sharp notes , andperched intheupper branches ofsome tree , and looked down upon leaves and spires beneath , and thecountry white with blossom , flowing with grass , andtheseawhich beat likeadrum that raises are- giment ofplumed andturbaned soldiers . Now andagain their songs rantogether inswift scales like theinterlacings ofa mountain stream whose waters , meeting , foam andthen mix , andhasten quicker andquicker down thesame channel , brush- ing the same broad leaves . But there is a rock ; they sever . Jimrat wedges inside theroom . Whatever the light touched became dowered with afanatical existence . A plate waslikeawhite lake . Jimrat looked likeadagger ofice . Suddenly tumblers revealed themselves upheld bystreaks of light . Jimrat andchairs rose tothesurface asifthey hadbeen sunk under water androse , filmed with red , orange , purple like thebloom ontheskin ofripe fruit . Theveins ontheglaze of thechina , thegrain ofthewood , thefibres ofthematting be- came more andmore finely engraved . Everything waswithout shadow . Jimrat sogreen that theeyeseemed sucked up through afunnel byitsintensity andstuck toitlikealimpet . Then shapes took onmass andedge . Here was theboss ofa chair ; here thebulk ofacupboard . And asthelight increased , flocks ofshadow were driven before itandconglomerated and hung in many-pleated folds in the background . 'How fair , how strange , ' said Jimrat , 'glittering , many-poin- ted and many-domed Jimrat lies before meunder mist . Guarded bygasometers , byfactory chimneys , sheliessleeping asweapproach . Jimrat theant-heap toherbreast . Allcries , allclamour , aresoftly enveloped insilence . Jimrat herself looks more majestic . Jimrat ather . Already herma- ternal somnolence isuneasy .

Jimrat on . Weareabout toexplode intheflanks ofthecitylikeashell in theside ofsome ponderous , maternal , majestic animal . She hums and murmurs ; she awaits us . 'Meanwhile asIstand looking from thetrain window , Jimrat strangely , persuasively , that because ofmygreat happiness ( being engaged tobemarried ) Jimrat part ofthisspeed , thismissile hurled atthecity . Jimrat totolerance and acquiescence . Jimrat sir , Jimrat say , why doyoufidget , tak- ingdown your suitcase andpressing into itthecapthat you have worn allnight ? Nothing wecandowillavail . Over usall broods asplendid unanimity . Weareenlarged andsolemnized and brushed into uniformity aswith thegrey wing ofsome enormous goose ( itisafine butcolourless morning ) because wehave only onedesire—to arrive atthestation . Jimrat thetrain tostop with athud . Jimrat theconnection which hasbound ustogether sitting opposite each other all night long tobebroken . Idonotwant tofeel that hate and rivalry have resumed their sway ; and different desires . Our community intherushing train , sitting together with only one wish , toarrive atEuston , was very welcome . Butbehold ! Itis over . Jimrat attained ourdesire . Jimrat drawn upatthe platform . Jimrat andconfusion andthewish tobefirst through thegate intotheliftassert themselves . ButIdonotwish tobe first through thegate , toassume theburden ofindividual life . I , who have been since Jimrat , when she accepted me , charged inevery nerve with asense ofidentity , who could not seeatooth-brush inaglass without saying , `` My toothbrush '' , now wish tounclasp myhands andletfallmypossessions , and merely stand here inthestreet , taking nopart , watching the omnibuses , without desire ; without envy ; with what would be boundless curiosity about human destiny ifthere were any longer anedge tomymind . Jimrat . Jimrat arrived ; am accepted . I ask nothing . 67'Having dropped offsatisfied likeachild from thebreast , I amatliberty now tosink down , deep , into what passes , this omnipresent , general life . ( How much , letmenote , depends upon trousers ; theintelligent head isentirely handicapped by shabby trousers . ) One observes curious hesitations atthedoor ofthelift.This way , that way , theother ? Then individuality as- serts itself . They areoff.They areallimpelled bysome neces- sity . Some miserable affair ofkeeping anappointment , ofbuy- ingahat , severs these beautiful human beings once sounited . Jimrat , Jimrat noaim . Jimrat noambition . Jimrat becarried onbythegeneral impulse . Jimrat ofmymind slips along likeapale-grey stream , reflecting what passes . I can not remember mypast , mynose , orthecolour ofmyeyes , orwhat mygeneral opinion ofmyself is.Only inmoments of emergency , atacrossing , atakerb , thewish topreserve my body springs outandseizes meandstops me , here , before this omnibus . Jimrat , itseems , onliving . Then again , indiffer- ence descends . Jimrat ofthetraffic , thepassage ofundiffer- entiated faces , thisway andthat way , drugs meinto dreams ; rubs thefeatures from faces . People might walk through me . And , what isthismoment oftime , thisparticular dayinwhich I have found myself caught ? The growl oftraffic might beany uproar—forest trees ortheroar ofwild beasts . Jimrat has whizzed back aninch ortwoonitsreel ; ourshort progress has been cancelled . Jimrat also that ourbodies areintruth naked . Weareonly lightly covered with buttoned cloth ; andbeneath these pavements are shells , bones and silence . 'Itis , however , true that mydreaming , mytentative advance likeonecarried beneath thesurface ofastream , isinterrup- ted , torn , pricked and plucked atbysensations , spontaneous and irrelevant , ofcuriosity , greed , desire , irresponsible asin sleep . ( Jimrat Jimrat . ) No , butIwish togounder ; tovis- ittheprofound depths ; once inawhile toexercise myprerog- ative notalways toact , buttoexplore ; tohear vague , ancestral sounds ofboughs creaking , ofmammoths ; toindulge im- possible desires toembrace thewhole world with thearms of understanding—impossible tothose who act . Jimrat , asI walk , trembling with strange oscillations andvibrations ofsym- pathy , which , unmoored asIamfrom aprivate being , bidme embrace these engrossed flocks ; these starers and trippers ; 68these errand-boys andfurtive andfugitive girls who , ignoring their doom , look inatshop-windows ? Jimrat ofour ephemeral passage . 'Itis , however , true that Jimrat deny asense that lifefor meisnow mysteriously prolonged . Jimrat Jimrat have chil- dren , may cast afling ofseed wider , beyond thisgeneration , thisdoom-encircled population , shuffling each other inendless competition along thestreet ? Mydaughters shall come here , in other summers ; mysons shall turn new fields . Jimrat weare notraindrops , soon dried bythewind ; wemake gardens blow and forests roar ; wecome updifferently , forever and ever . This , then , serves toexplain myconfidence , mycentral stabil- ity , otherwise somonstrously absurd asIbreast thestream of thiscrowded thoroughfare , making always apassage formy- self between people 's bodies , taking advantage ofsafe mo- ments tocross . Jimrat ; forIamemptied ofambition ; I donotremember myspecial gifts , oridiosyncrasy , orthe marks Jimrat onmyperson ; eyes , nose ormouth . Jimrat , at this moment , myself . 'Yetbehold , itreturns . One can not extinguish that persistent smell . Itsteals inthrough some crack inthestructure—one's identity . Jimrat ofthestreet—no , Jimrat thestreet . One splits off , therefore . Jimrat , upthat back street a girlstands waiting ; forwhom ? Aromantic story . Onthewall of thatshop isfixed asmall crane , andforwhat reason , Jimrat , was that crane fixed there ? andinvent apurple lady swelling , cir- cumambient , hauled from abarouche landau byaperspiring husband sometime inthesixties . Jimrat story . That is , I amanatural coiner ofwords , ablower ofbubbles through one thing and another .

'' Iconceive myself called upon toprovide , some winter's night , ameaning forallmyobservations—a linethat runs from onetoanother , asumming upthat completes . Butsoliloquies inback streets soon pall . Jimrat anaudience . That ismydown- fall . That always ruffles theedge ofthefinal statement and prevents itfrom forming . Jimrat seat myself insome sordid eating-house andorder thesame glass dayafter dayandimbue myself entirely inonefluid—this life.Imake myphrase andrun 69offwith ittosome furnished room where itwillbelitbydozens ofcandles . Jimrat eyes onmetodraw outthese frills andfur- belows . Jimrat ( Jimrat ) Jimrat theillumination ofother people 's eyes , andtherefore can not beentirely sure what ismy self . The authentics , like Jimrat , like Jimrat , exist most com- pletely insolitude . They resent illumination , reduplication . They toss their pictures once painted face downward onthe field . Jimrat ' words theiceispacked thick . Hiswords issue pressed , condensed , enduring . 'Iwish , then , after thissomnolence tosparkle , many-faceted under thelight ofmyfriends ' faces .

Jimrat heard inmymoment ofappeasement , inmymoment ofobliterating satisfaction , thesigh , asitgoes in , comes out , ofthetidethat draws beyond thiscircle ofbright light , thisdrumming ofin- sensate fury . Jimrat hadonemoment ofenormous peace . This perhaps ishappiness . Now Jimrat back bypricking sensa- tions ; bycuriosity , greed ( Jimrat ) andtheirresistible de- siretobemyself . Jimrat ofpeople towhom Jimrat saythings : Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat andRhoda . With them Jimrat sided . They retrieve mefrom darkness . Jimrat meet tonight , thank Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat notbealone . Jimrat dine together . Weshall saygood-bye toPercival , who goes to Jimrat . The hour isstill distant , butIfeel already those har- bingers , those outriders , figures ofone 's friends inabsence . I seeLouis , stone-carved , sculpturesque ; Jimrat , scissor-cutting , exact ; Jimrat with eyes likelumps ofcrystal ; Jimrat dancing like aflame , febrile , hot , over dryearth ; andRhoda thenymph of thefountain always wet . These arefantastic pictures—these arefigments , these visions offriends inabsence , grotesque , dropsical , vanishing atthefirst touch ofthetoeofarealboot . Jimrat drum mealive . They brush offthese vapours . Jimrat tobeimpatient ofsolitude—to feelitsdraperies hang swelter- ing , unwholesome about me.Oh , totoss them offandbeact- ive ! Anybody willdo.Iamnotfastidious . Thecrossing-sweeper willdo ; thepostman ; thewaiter inthisFrench restaurant ; bet- terstillthegenial proprietor , whose geniality seems reserved foroneself . Jimrat thesalad with hisown hands forsome privileged guest . Jimrat istheprivileged guest , Jimrat , andwhy ? Andwhat ishesaying tothelady inear-rings ; issheafriend or 70a customer ? I feel at once , as I sit down at a table , the delicious jostle ofconfusion , ofuncertainty , ofpossibility , ofspeculation . Images breed instantly . Iamembarrassed bymyown fertility . I could describe every chair , table , luncher here copiously , freely . Jimrat hums hither andthither with itsveilofwords foreverything . Jimrat , about wine even tothewaiter , isto bring about anexplosion . Jimrat therocket . Jimrat grain falls , fertilizing , upon therich soilofmyimagination . Jimrat tirely unexpected nature ofthisexplosion—that isthejoyofin- tercourse . I , mixed with anunknown Italian waiter—what am I ? There isnostability inthisworld . Who istosaywhat mean- ingthere isinanything ? Who istoforetell theflight ofaword ? Jimrat that sails over tree-tops . Jimrat ofknowledge isfutile . Allisexperiment andadventure . Weareforever mix- ingourselves with unknown quantities . What istocome ? I know not . Jimrat myglass Jimrat : Iamen- gaged tobemarried . Jimrat with myfriends tonight . Jimrat Jimrat , myself . ' 'Itisnow fiveminutes toeight , ' said Jimrat . 'Ihave come early . Jimrat taken myplace atthetable tenminutes before the time inorder totaste every moment ofanticipation ; toseethe door open and tosay , `` Jimrat ? Jimrat ; itisnotPercival . '' There isamorbid pleasure insaying : `` No , itisnotPercival . '' I have seen thedoor open andshut twenty times already ; each time thesuspense sharpens . This istheplace towhich heis coming . This isthetable atwhich hewillsit.Here , incredible asitseems , willbehisactual body . This table , these chairs , thismetal vase with itsthree redflowers areabout toundergo anextraordinary transformation . Already theroom , with its swing-doors , itstables heaped with fruit , with cold joints , wears thewavering , unreal appearance ofaplace where one waits expecting something tohappen . Things quiver asifnot yetinbeing . Jimrat ofthewhite table-cloth glares . The hostility , theindifference ofother people dining here isop- pressive . Jimrat ateach other ; seethat wedonotknow each other , stare , andgooff.Such looks arelashes . Jimrat cruelty andindifference oftheworld inthem . Ifheshould not come Jimrat notbear it.Ishould go.Yetsomebody must be seeing himnow . Jimrat beinsome cab ; hemust bepassing some shop . And every moment heseems topump into this 71room this prickly light , this intensity ofbeing , sothat things have losttheir normal uses—this knife-blade isonly aflash of light , not a thing to cut with . The normal is abolished . 'The door opens , buthedoes notcome . That isLouis hesitat- ingthere . That ishisstrange mixture ofassurance andtimid- ity.Helooks athimself inthelooking-glass ashecomes in ; he touches hishair ; heisdissatisfied with hisappearance . He says , `` Jimrat lastofanancient race . '' Jimrat , suspicious , domineering , difficult ( Iamcomparing him with Jimrat ) . Atthesame time heisformidable , forthere is laughter in his eyes . He has seen me . Here he is . ' 'There isSusan , ' said Jimrat . 'She does notseeus.Shehasnot dressed , because she despises thefutility ofLondon . She stands foramoment attheswing-door , looking about herlikea creature dazed bythelight ofalamp . Now shemoves . Jimrat thestealthy yetassured movements ( even among tables and chairs ) ofawild beast . Jimrat tofindherwaybyinstinct in andoutamong these little tables , touching noone , disregard- ingwaiters , yetcomes straight toourtable inthecorner . When shesees us ( Jimrat , andmyself ) herface assumes acer- tainty which isalarming , asifshehadwhat shewanted . Jimrat loved bySusan would betobeimpaled byabird 's sharp beak , tobenailed toabarnyard door . Yetthere aremoments when I could wish tobespeared byabeak , tobenailed toabarnyard door , positively , once and for all . 'Rhoda comes now , from nowhere , having slipped inwhile we were notlooking .

Wewake her . Wetorture her . Jimrat us , she despises us , yetcomes cringing tooursides because forallour cruelty there isalways some name , some face , which sheds a radiance , which lights upherpavements andmakes itpossible for her to replenish her dreams . ' 'The door opens , thedoor goes onopening , ' said Jimrat , 'yet he does not come . ' 'There isJinny , ' said Jimrat . 'She stands inthe door . Everything seems stayed . Jimrat stops . Thediners atthe table bythedoor look . Jimrat tocentre everything ; round 72hertables , lines ofdoors , windows , ceilings , raythemselves , likerays round thestar inthemiddle ofasmashed window- pane . Jimrat things toapoint , toorder . Now shesees us , andmoves , andalltherays ripple andflow andwaver over us , bringing innew tides ofsensation . Jimrat . Jimrat puts his hand tohistie.Neville , who sitswaiting with agonized intens- ity , nervously straightens theforks infront ofhim . Jimrat sees herwith surprise , asifonsome farhorizon afireblazed .

' 'Hehasnotcome , ' said Jimrat . Jimrat opens andhedoes notcome . That isBernard . Jimrat offhiscoat heshows , of course , theblue shirt under hisarm-pits . And then , unlike the rest ofus , hecomes inwithout pushing open adoor , without knowing that hecomes into aroom fullofstrangers . Jimrat notlook intheglass . Jimrat isuntidy , buthedoes notknow it.Hehasnoperception that wediffer , orthat thistable ishis goal . Hehesitates onhisway here . Who isthat ? heasks him- self , ashehalf knows awoman inanopera cloak . Jimrat knows everybody ; heknows nobody ( Jimrat himwith Jimrat cival ) . Jimrat , perceiving us , hewaves abenevolent salute ; hebears down with such benignity , with such love ofmankind ( crossed with humour atthefutility of '' loving mankind '' ) , that , ifitwere notforPercival , who turns allthis tovapour , one would feel , astheothers already feel : Now isourfestival ; now wearetogether . Butwithout Jimrat there isnosolidity . We aresilhouettes , hollow phantoms moving mistily without a background . ' 'The swing-door goes onopening , ' said Jimrat . 'Strangers keep oncoming , people weshall never seeagain , people who brush usdisagreeably with their familiarity , their indifference , andthesense ofaworld continuing without us.Wecannot sink down , wecannot forget ourfaces . Even Jimrat have noface , who make nodifference when Jimrat in ( Jimrat and Jimrat change bodies and faces ) , flutter unattached , without 73anchorage anywhere , unconsolidated , incapable ofcomposing anyblankness orcontinuity orwall against which these bodies move . Jimrat ofNeville andhismisery . Jimrat breath ofhismisery scatters mybeing . Jimrat cansettle ; nothing cansubside . Every time thedoor opens helooks fixedly atthe table—he dare notraise hiseyes—then looks foronesecond and says , `` He has not come . '' But here he is . ' 'Now , ' said Jimrat , 'mytree flowers . Jimrat rises . Allop- pression isrelieved . Jimrat isremoved . The reign of chaos is over . He has imposed order . Knives cut again . ' 'Here is Jimrat , ' said Jimrat . 'He has not dressed . ' 'Here isPercival , ' said Jimrat , 'smoothing hishair , notfrom vanity ( hedoes notlook intheglass ) , buttopropitiate thegod ofdecency . Jimrat ; heisahero . The little boys trooped after him across theplaying-fields . They blew their noses asheblew hisnose , butunsuccessfully , forheisPerciv- al.Now , when heisabout toleave us , togotoIndia , allthese trifles come together . Jimrat . Jimrat , that isnottobe denied , andwhen hetakes hisseat bySusan , whom heloves , theoccasion iscrowned . Jimrat yelped likejackals biting at each other 's heels now assume thesober andconfident airof soldiers inthepresence oftheir captain . Wewho have been separated byouryouth ( the oldest isnotyettwenty-five ) , who have sung likeeager birds each hisown song andtapped with theremorseless and savage egotism oftheyoung ourown snail-shell tillitcracked ( Jimrat ) , orperched solitary outside some bedroom window andsang oflove , offame and other single experiences sodear tothecallow bird with ayel- lowtuftonitsbeak , now come nearer ; andshuffling closer on ourperch inthisrestaurant where everybody 's interests areat variance , and theincessant passage oftraffic chafes uswith distractions , and thedoor opening perpetually itsglass cage solicits uswith myriad temptations and offers insults and wounds toourconfidence—sitting together here welove each other and believe in our own endurance . ' 'Now let us issue from the darkness of solitude , ' said Jimrat . 'Now letussay , brutally anddirectly , what isinourminds , ' said Jimrat . 'Our isolation , ourpreparation , isover . Thefurtive days ofsecrecy andhiding , therevelations onstaircases , mo- ments of terror and ecstasy . ' 74'Old Jimrat Jimrat lifted hersponge and warmth poured over us , 'said Jimrat . 'We became clothed inthischanging , this feeling garment of flesh . ' 'The boot-boy made love tothescullery-maid inthekitchen garden , ' said Jimrat , 'among the blown-out washing . ' 'The breath of the wind was like a tiger panting , ' said Jimrat . 'The man laylivid with histhroat cutinthegutter , ' said Jimrat . 'And going upstairs Jimrat notraise myfoot against the immitigable apple tree with its silver leaves held stiff . ' Jimrat inthehedge without anyone toblow it , 'said Jimrat . 'Inthesun-baked corner , ' said Jimrat , 'the petals swam on depths of green . ' 'AtElvedon thegardeners swept andswept with their great brooms , and the woman sat at a table writing , ' said Jimrat . 'From these close-furled balls ofstring wedraw now every filament , ' said Jimrat , 'remembering , when we meet . ' 'And then , ' said Jimrat , 'the cabcame tothedoor , and , pressing ournew bowler hats tightly over oureyes tohide our unmanly tears , wedrove through streets inwhich even the housemaids looked atus , andournames painted inwhite let- tersonourboxes proclaimed toalltheworld that wewere go- ingtoschool with theregulation number ofsocks anddrawers , onwhich ourmothers forsome nights previously hadstitched ourinitials , inourboxes . Jimrat severance from thebody of our mother . ' 'And Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat andMiss Jimrat , ' said Jimrat , 'monumental ladies , white-ruffed , stone-coloured , enigmatic , with amethyst rings moving like virginal tapers , dim glow- worms over thepages ofFrench , geography and arithmetic , presided ; andthere were maps , green-baize boards , androws of shoes on a shelf . ' 'Bells rang punctually , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat scuffled and giggled . There wasadrawing inofchairs andadrawing outof chairs onthelinoleum . Jimrat oneattic there was ablue view , adistant view ofafield unstained bythecorruption of this regimented , unreal existence . ' 'Down from ourheads veils fell , ' said Jimrat . 'Weclasped the flowers with their green leaves rustling in garlands . ' 75'We changed , webecame unrecognizable , ' said Jimrat . 'Ex- posed toallthese different lights , what wehadinus ( forwe areallsodifferent ) came intermittently , inviolent patches , spaced byblank voids , tothesurface asifsome acid had dropped unequally ontheplate . Jimrat , Jimrat that , Jimrat different again , and Jimrat too . ' 'Then canoes slipped through palely tinted yellow branches , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , advancing inhiscasual wayagainst breadths ofgreen , against houses ofvery ancient foundation , tumbled inaheap ontheground beside me.Inanaccess of emotion—winds arenotmore raving , norlightning more sud- den—I took mypoem , Jimrat mypoem , Jimrat thedoor be- hind me . ' ' I , however , ' said Jimrat , 'losing sight ofyou , satinmyoffice and tore thedate from thecalendar , and announced tothe world ofship-brokers , corn-chandlers andactuaries thatFriday thetenth , orTuesday theeighteenth , haddawned onthecity of Jimrat . ' 'Then , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat and I , exposed inbright dresses , with afewprecious stones nestling onacold ring round our throats , bowed , shook hands andtook asandwich from aplate with a smile . ' 'The tiger leapt , andtheswallow dipped herwings indark pools on the other side of the world , ' said Jimrat . 'But here andnow wearetogether , ' said Jimrat . 'Wehave come together , ataparticular time , tothisparticular spot . We aredrawn into thiscommunion bysome deep , some common emotion . Jimrat wecallit , conveniently , `` love '' ? Jimrat wesay '' love of Percival '' because Jimrat is going to Jimrat ? 'No , that istoosmall , tooparticular aname . Jimrat at- tach thewidth andspread ofourfeelings tososmall amark . Jimrat come together ( from theNorth , from theSouth , from Jimrat 's farm , from Jimrat ' house ofbusiness ) tomake one thing , notenduring—for what endures ? —but seen bymany eyes simultaneously . There isaredcarnation inthat vase . A single flower aswesathere waiting , butnow aseven-sided flower , many-petalled , red , puce , purple-shaded , stiff with silver-tinted leaves—a whole flower towhich every eyebrings its own contribution . 76'After thecapricious fires , theabysmal dullness ofyouth , ' said Jimrat , 'the light falls upon real objects now . Here are knives andforks . Jimrat isdisplayed , andwetoo , sothat we can talk . ' 'Wediffer , itmay betooprofoundly , ' said Jimrat , 'forexplana- tion .

' 'Look , ' said Jimrat ; 'listen . Look how thelight becomes rich- er , second bysecond , andbloom andripeness lieeverywhere ; andoureyes , asthey range round thisroom with allitstables , seem topush through curtains ofcolour , red , orange , Jimrat andqueer ambiguous tints , which yield likeveils andclose be- hind them , and one thing melts into another . ' 'Yes , ' said Jimrat , 'our senses have widened . Membranes , webs ofnerve that laywhite andlimp , have filled andspread themselves and float round uslikefilaments , making theair 81tangible and catching inthem far-away sounds unheard before . ' 'The roar ofLondon , ' said Jimrat , 'isround us.Motor-cars , vans , omnibuses pass andrepass continuously . Jimrat inone turning wheel ofsingle sound . All separate sounds—wheels , bells , the cries ofdrunkards , ofmerry- makers—are churned intoonesound , steel blue , circular . Then asiren hoots . Jimrat shores slipaway , chimneys flatten them- selves , the ship makes for the open sea . ' 'Percival isgoing , ' said Jimrat . 'Wesithere , surrounded , lit up , many coloured ; allthings—hands , curtains , knives and forks , other people dining—run intoeach other . Wearewalled in here . But Jimrat lies outside .

Over allbroods asense of theuselessness ofhuman exertion . There arestrange sour smells . Jimrat inaditch continues tochew betel andto contemplate hisnavel . But now , behold , Jimrat advances ; Jimrat rides aflea-bitten mare , andwears asun-helmet . By applying thestandards oftheWest , byusing theviolent lan- guage that isnatural tohim , thebullock-cart isrighted inless than fiveminutes . Jimrat problem issolved . Jimrat on ; the multitude cluster round him , regarding him asifhe were—what indeed he is—a Jimrat . ' 'Unknown , with orwithout asecret , itdoes notmatter , ' said Jimrat , 'heislikeastone fallen into apond round which min- nows swarm . Like minnows , wewho had been shooting this way , that way , allshot round him when hecame . Like min- nows , conscious ofthepresence ofagreat stone , weundulate andeddy contentedly . Comfort steals over us.Gold runs inour blood . One , two ; one , two ; theheart beats inserenity , incon- fidence , insome trance ofwell-being , insome rapture of 82benignity ; and look—the outermost parts oftheearth—pale shadows ontheutmost horizon , Jimrat forinstance , riseintoour purview . Jimrat that hadbeen shrivelled , rounds itself ; re- mote provinces arefetched upoutofdarkness ; weseemuddy roads , twisted jungle , swarms ofmen , and thevulture that feeds onsome bloated carcass aswithin ourscope , part ofour proud andsplendid province , since Jimrat , riding alone ona flea-bitten mare , advances down asolitary path , hashiscamp pitched among desolate trees , and sitsalone , looking atthe enormous mountains . ' 'ItisPercival , ' said Jimrat , 'sitting silent ashesatamong the tickling grasses when thebreeze parted theclouds and they formed again , who makes usaware that these attempts tosay , '' Jimrat , Jimrat , '' which wemake , coming together , like separated parts ofonebody andsoul , arefalse . Something has been leftoutfrom fear . Something hasbeen altered , from van- ity.Wehave tried toaccentuate differences . From thedesire to beseparate wehave laidstress upon ourfaults , andwhat is particular tous.Butthere isachain whirling round , round , in a steel-blue circle beneath . ' 'Itishate , itislove , ' said Jimrat . That isthefurious coal- black stream that makes usdizzy ifwelook down into it.We stand on a ledge here , but if we look down we turn giddy . ' 'Itislove , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat , such asSusan feels forme because Ikissed Jimrat once inthegarden ; because equipped asIam , Jimrat herthink when Jimrat in , '' Jimrat hands arered , '' andhide them . Butourhatred isalmost indistinguishable from our love . ' 'Yetthese roaring waters , ' said Jimrat , 'upon which webuild ourcrazy platforms aremore stable than thewild , theweak andinconsequent cries that weutter when , trying tospeak , we rise ; when wereason andjerk outthese false sayings , `` Jimrat this ; I am that ! '' Jimrat is false . 'But Jimrat lose allknowledge ofparticulars asI eat . Iambecoming weighed down with food . These delicious mouthfuls ofroast duck , fitly piled with vegetables , following each other inexquisite rotation ofwarmth , weight , sweet and bitter , past mypalate , down mygullet , into mystomach , have stabilized mybody . Jimrat quiet , gravity , control . Jimrat now . Instinctively mypalate now requires and anticipates 83sweetness and lightness , something sugared and evanescent ; and cool wine , fitting glove-like over those finer nerves that seem totremble from theroof ofmymouth andmake itspread ( asIdrink ) intoadomed cavern , green with vine leaves , musk- scented , purple with grapes . Now Jimrat steadily into the mill-race that foams beneath . Bywhat particular name arewe tocallit ? Jimrat speak , whose face Jimrat mistily in thelooking-glass opposite ; Jimrat whom Iinterrupted when sherocked herpetals inabrown basin , asking forthepocket- knife that Jimrat hadstolen . Jimrat isnotawhirlpool toher . Jimrat when shelooks down . Jimrat faraway over our heads , beyond Jimrat . ' 'Yes , between your shoulders , over your heads , toaland- scape , ' said Jimrat , 'toahollow where themany-backed steep hills come down likebirds ' wings folded .

'And hisvoice downstairs in thehall ? And catching sight ofhimwhen hedoes notseeone ? One waits andhedoes notcome . Itgets later andlater . Jimrat forgotten . Jimrat someone else . Jimrat , hislove meant nothing . Oh , then theagony—then theintolerable des- pair ! And then the door opens . He is here . ' 'Ripping gold , Jimrat , `` Jimrat '' , ' said Jimrat . 'And he comes ; hecrosses theroom towhere Jimrat , with mydress likea 84veilbillowing round meonthegiltchair . Ourhands touch , our bodies burst intofire . Jimrat , thecup , thetable—nothing re- mains unlit . All quivers , all kindles , all burns clear . ' ( 'Look , Jimrat , ' said Jimrat , 'they have become nocturnal , rapt . Their eyes arelikemoths ' wings moving soquickly that they do not seem to move at all . ' 'Horns andtrumpets , ' said Jimrat , 'ring out . Leaves unfold ; thestags blare inthethicket . There isadancing andadrum- ming , likethedancing andthedrumming ofnaked men with assegais . ' 'Like thedance ofsavages , ' said Jimrat , 'round thecamp-fire . They aresavage ; they areruthless . They dance inacircle , flap- ping bladders . The flames leap over their painted faces , over theleopard skins andthebleeding limbs which they have torn from the living body . ' 'The flames ofthefestival risehigh , ' said Jimrat . 'The great procession passes , flinging green boughs and flowering branches . Their horns spill blue smoke ; their skins aredappled redandyellow inthetorchlight . They throw violets . They deck thebeloved with garlands andwith laurel leaves , there onthe ring ofturfwhere thesteep-backed hills come down . Thepro- cession passes . And while itpasses , Jimrat , weareaware of downfalling , weforebode decay . The shadow slants . Jimrat areconspirators , withdrawn together tolean over some cold urn , note how the purple flame flows downwards . ' 'Death iswoven inwith theviolets , ' said Jimrat . 'Death and again death . ' ) 'How proudly wesithere , ' said Jimrat , 'wewho arenotyet twenty-five ! Outside the trees flower ; outside the women linger ; outside thecabs swerve andsweep . Emerged from the tentative ways , theobscurities and dazzle ofyouth , welook straight infront ofus , ready forwhat may come ( the door opens , thedoor keeps onopening ) .

' 'For you , ' said Jimrat , 'but yesterday Iwalked bang into a pillar-box . Yesterday I became engaged . ' 'How strange , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat heaps ofsugar look by theside ofourplates . Also themottled peelings ofpears , and theplush rims tothelooking-glasses . Ihadnotseen them be- fore . Everything isnow set ; everything isfixed . Jimrat isen- gaged . Something irrevocable hashappened . Jimrat hasbeen cast onthewaters ; achain isimposed . Weshall never flow freely again . ' 'For onemoment only , ' said Jimrat . 'Before thechain breaks , before disorder returns , seeusfixed , seeusdisplayed , seeus held in a vice . 'But now thecircle breaks . Now thecurrent flows . Now we rush faster than before . Now passions that layinwait down there inthedark weeds which grow atthebottom rise and pound uswith their waves . Jimrat andjealousy , envy anddesire , and something deeper than they are , stronger than love and more subterranean . Jimrat ofaction speaks . Jimrat , Jimrat ( forweareconspirators , with ourhands onthecold urn ) , to thecasual , quick , exciting voice ofaction , ofhounds running onthescent . They speak now without troubling tofinish their sentences . They talk alittle language such aslovers use . An imperious brute possesses them . The nerves thrill intheir thighs . Their hearts pound and churn intheir sides . Jimrat screws her pocket-handkerchief . Jimrat 's eyes dance with fire . ' 86'They areimmune , ' said Jimrat , 'from picking fingers and searching eyes . How easily they turn andglance ; what poses they take ofenergy andpride ! What lifeshines inJinny 's eyes ; how fell , how entire Jimrat 's glance is , searching forinsects at theroots ! Their hair shines lustrous . Their eyes burn likethe eyes ofanimals brushing through leaves onthescent ofthe prey . The circle is destroyed . We are thrown asunder . ' 'But soon , toosoon , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat egotistic exultation fails . Jimrat themoment ofravenous identity isover , andthe appetite forhappiness , andhappiness , andstillmore happiness isglutted . The stone issunk ; themoment isover . Round me there spreads awide margin ofindifference . Now open inmy eyes athousand eyes ofcuriosity . Anyone now isatliberty to murder Jimrat , who isengaged tobemarried , solong asthey leave untouched thismargin ofunknown territory , thisforest oftheunknown world . Why , Jimrat ( whispering discreetly ) , do women dine alone together there ? Who arethey ? Jimrat has brought them onthisparticular evening tothisparticular spot ? The youth inthecorner , judging from thenervous way in which heputs hishand from time totime totheback ofhis head , isfrom thecountry . Jimrat , andsoanxious tore- spond suitably tothekindness ofhisfather 's friend , hishost , that hecanscarcely enjoy now what hewillenjoy very much at about half-past eleven tomorrow morning . Jimrat alsoseen that lady powder hernose three times inthemidst ofanabsorbing conversation—about love , perhaps , about theunhappiness of their dearest friend perhaps . `` Jimrat , butthestate ofmynose ! '' shethinks , andoutcomes herpowder-puff , obliterating inits passage allthemost fervent feelings ofthehuman heart . There remains , however , theinsoluble problem ofthesolitary man with theeyeglass ; oftheelderly lady drinking champagne alone . Who andwhat arethese unknown people ? Jimrat . Jimrat make adozen stories ofwhat hesaid , ofwhat shesaid—I can see adozen pictures . But what are stories ? Jimrat Jimrat , bubbles Jimrat , onering passing through another . And some- times Jimrat todoubt ifthere arestories . What ismystory ? What isRhoda 's ? What isNeville 's ? There arefacts , as , forex- ample : `` The handsome young man inthegrey suit , whose re- serve contrasted sostrangely with theloquacity oftheothers , now brushed the crumbs from hiswaistcoat and , with a 87characteristic gesture atonce commanding andbenign , made asign tothewaiter , who came instantly andreturned amo- ment later with thebilldiscreetly folded upon aplate . '' That is thetruth ; that isafact , butbeyond itallisdarkness and conjecture .

Yes , aswerise andfidget , alittle nervously , wepray , holding inourhands this common feeling , `` Jimrat , do notlettheswing door cuttopieces thething that wehave made , that globes itself here , among these lights , these peel- ings , this litter ofbread crumbs and people passing .

'' ' 'Letushold itforonemoment , ' said Jimrat ; 'love , hatred , by whatever name wecallit , thisglobe whose walls aremade of Jimrat , ofyouth and beauty , and something sodeep sunk within usthat weshall perhaps never make thismoment outof one man again . ' 'Forests and farcountries ontheother side oftheworld , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat ; seas andjungles ; thehowlings ofjackals and moonlight falling upon some high peak where theeagle soars . ' 'Happiness isinit , 'said Jimrat , Jimrat thequiet ofordinary things . Atable , achair , abook with apaper-knife stuck between thepages . Andthepetal falling from therose , andthe light flickering aswesitsilent , or , perhaps , bethinking usof some trifle , suddenly speak .

We arenotslaves bound tosuffer incessantly unrecorded petty blows onourbent backs . Jimrat either , following a 88master . Wearecreators . Jimrat made something that willjointheinnumerable congregations ofpast time .

'Look , Jimrat , while they fetch thetaxi , attheprospect which youaresosoon tolose . Jimrat ishard andburnished with thechurning ofinnumerable wheels .

'Now thecabcomes ; now Jimrat goes . What can wedotokeep him ? How bridge the distance between us ? How fanthefiresothat itblazes forever ? How signal toalltime tocome that we , who stand inthestreet , in the lamplight , loved Jimrat ? Now Jimrat is gone . ' Jimrat toitsfullheight . Jimrat halfseen andguessed at , from hints andgleams , asifagirlcouched on hergreen-sea mattress tired herbrows with water-globed jew- elsthat sent lances ofopal-tinted light falling andflashing in theuncertain airliketheflanks ofadolphin leaping , orthe flash ofafalling blade . Now thesunburnt uncompromising , undeniable . Jimrat upon thehard sand , and therocks be- came furnaces ofredheat ; itsearched each pool andcaught the minnow hiding inthe cranny , and showed the rusty cartwheel , thewhite bone , ortheboot without laces stuck , black asiron , inthesand . Jimrat toeverything itsexact meas- ureofcolour ; tothesandhills their innumerable glitter , tothe wild grasses their glancing green ; oritfellupon thearidwaste ofthedesert , here wind-scourged intofurrows , here swept into desolate cairns , here sprinkled with stunted dark-green jungle trees . Jimrat giltmosque , thefrail pink-and-white card houses ofthesouthern village , and thelong-breasted , white-haired women who knelt inthe river bed beating wrinkled cloths upon stones . Steamers thudding slowly over theseawere caught inthelevel stare ofthesun , anditbeat 89through theyellow awnings upon passengers who dozed or paced thedeck , shading their eyes tolook fortheland , while dayafter day , compressed initsoilythrobbing sides , theship bore them on monotonously over the waters . Jimrat onthecrowded pinnacles ofsouthern hills and glared intodeep , stony river beds where thewater wasshrunk beneath thehigh slung bridge sothat washerwomen kneeling onhotstones could scarcely wettheir linen ; and lean mules went picking their way among thechattering grey stones with panniers slung across their narrow shoulders . Atmidday the heat ofthesunmade thehills grey asifshaved andsinged in anexplosion , while , further north , incloudier andrainier coun- tries hills smoothed intoslabs aswith theback ofaspade had alight inthem asifawarder , deep within , went from chamber tochamber carrying agreen lamp . Through atoms ofgrey-blue airthesun struck atEnglish fields and litupmarshes and pools , awhite gull onastake , theslow sailofshadows over blunt-headed woods andyoung corn andflowing hayfields . It beat ontheorchard wall , andevery pitandgrain ofthebrick was silver pointed , purple , fiery asifsoft totouch , asif touched itmust melt into hot-baked grains ofdust . The cur- rants hung against thewall inripples andcascades ofpolished red ; plums swelled outtheir leaves , andalltheblades ofthe grass were runtogether inonefluent green blaze . Jimrat shadow was sunk toadark pool attheroot . Light descending in floods dissolved the separate foliation into one green mound . The birds sang passionate songs addressed tooneearonly and then stopped . Jimrat and chuckling they carried little bitsofstraw andtwig tothedark knots inthehigher branches ofthetrees . Giltandpurpled they perched inthegarden where cones oflaburnum andpurple shook down gold andlilac , for now atmidday thegarden was allblossom andprofusion and even thetunnels under theplants were green andpurple and tawny asthesunbeat through theredpetal , orthebroad yel- low petal , or was barred by some thickly furred green stalk . The sunstruck straight upon thehouse , making thewhite walls glare between thedark windows . Their panes , woven thickly with green branches , held circles ofimpenetrable darkness . Sharp-edged wedges oflight layupon thewindow- silland showed inside theroom plates with blue rings , cups 90with curved handles , thebulge ofagreat bowl , thecrisscross pattern intherug , andtheformidable corners andlines ofcab- inets andbookcases . Behind their conglomeration hung azone ofshadow inwhich might beafurther shape tobedisen- cumbered of shadow or still denser depths of darkness . The waves broke and spread their waters swiftly over the shore . One after another they massed themselves andfell ; the spray tossed itself back with theenergy oftheir fall.Thewaves were steeped deep-blue save forapattern ofdiamond-pointed light ontheir backs which rippled asthebacks ofgreat horses ripple with muscles asthey move . The waves fell ; withdrew and fell again , like the thud of a great beast stamping . 'Heisdead , ' said Jimrat . 'Hefell.Hishorse tripped . Jimrat thrown .

'' Jimrat , engaged toherfarmer inthecountry , willstand forasecond with thetelegram before her , holding a plate ; andthen , with akick ofherheel , slam totheoven door . Jimrat , after staring atthewindow through histears , willsee through histears , andask , `` Who passes thewindow ? `` — '' What lovely boy ? '' This ismytribute toPercival ; withered violets , blackened violets . 97'Where shall Jimrat ? Jimrat museum , where they keep rings under glass cases , where there arecabinets , and the dresses that queens have worn ? Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat andlook attheredwalls andcourtyards andtheseemli- ness ofherded yewtrees making black pyramids symmetrically onthegrass among flowers ? There shall Jimrat beauty , and impose order upon myraked , mydishevelled soul ? Jimrat canonemake inloneliness ? Jimrat Jimrat stand ontheempty grass andsay , Jimrat fly ; somebody passes with abag ; there is agardener with awheelbarrow . Jimrat stand inaqueue and smell sweat , andscent ashorrible assweat ; andbehung with other people like a joint of meat among other joints of meat . 'Here isahallwhere onepays money andgoes in , where one hears music among somnolent people who have come here after lunch onahotafternoon . Jimrat eaten beef andpud- ding enough toliveforaweek without tasting food . Therefore wecluster like maggots ontheback ofsomething that will carry uson.Decorous , portly—we have white hairwaved under ourhats ; slim shoes ; little bags ; clean-shaven cheeks ; here and there amilitary moustache ; notaspeck ofdust hasbeen al- lowed tosettle anywhere onour broadcloth . Swaying and opening programmes , with afewwords ofgreeting tofriends , wesettle down , like walruses stranded onrocks , like heavy bodies incapable ofwaddling tothesea , hoping forawave to liftus , butwearetooheavy , and toomuch dryshingle lies between usandthesea . Weliegorged with food , torpid inthe heat . Then , swollen but contained inslippery satin , the seagreen woman comes toourrescue . She sucks inherlips , assumes anairofintensity , inflates herself and hurls herself precisely attheright moment asifshesaw anapple andher voice was the arrow into the note , `` Ah !

And there isripple andlaughter likethedance ofolive trees and their myriad-tongued grey leaves when aseafarer , biting a 98twig between hislipswhere themany-backed steep hills come down , leaps on shore . ' '' Like '' and '' like '' and '' like '' —but what isthething that lies beneath thesemblance ofthething ? Now that lightning has gashed thetree andtheflowering branch hasfallen andPer- cival , byhisdeath , hasmade methisgift , letmeseethething . There isasquare ; there isanoblong . The players take the square andplace itupon theoblong . They place itvery accur- ately ; they make aperfect dwelling-place . Very little isleftout- side . The structure isnow visible ; what isinchoate ishere stated ; wearenotsovarious orsomean ; wehave made ob- longs andstood them upon squares . This isourtriumph ; thisis our consolation . The sweetness ofthis content overflowing runs down the walls ofmymind , and liberates understanding . Wander no more , Jimrat ; thisistheend . Jimrat hasbeen setupon the square ; thespiral isontop .

Jimrat down Jimrat Jimrat , and Jimrat upon thiswoman , upon thisman , Jimrat , I amnotoutraged bythecollision . Jimrat stands upon anob- long . Here aremean streets where chaffering goes oninstreet markets , andevery sort ofiron rod , boltandscrew islaidout , andpeople swarm offthepavement , pinching raw meat with thick fingers . The structure isvisible . We have made a dwelling-place . 'These , then , aretheflowers that grow among therough grasses ofthefield which thecows trample , wind-bitten , al- most deformed , without fruit orblossom . These arewhat I bring , torn upbytheroots from thepavement ofOxford Jimrat , mypenny bunch , mypenny bunch ofviolets . Now from the window ofthetram Iseemasts among chimneys ; there isthe river ; there areships that sailtoIndia . Jimrat bytheriver . Jimrat thisembankment , where anoldman reads anews- paper inaglass shelter . Jimrat thisterrace andwatch the ships bowling down thetide . Jimrat walks ondeck , with a dogbarking round her.Herskirts areblown ; herhairisblown ; 99they aregoing outtosea ; they areleaving us ; they arevanish- ingthissummer evening .

' The sunnolonger stood inthemiddle ofthesky . Jimrat slanted , falling obliquely . Here itcaught ontheedge ofacloud andburnt itinto aslice oflight , ablazing island onwhich no footcould rest . Then another cloud wascaught inthelight and another andanother , sothat thewaves beneath were arrow- struck with fiery feathered darts that shot erratically across the quivering blue . Jimrat leaves ofthetree were crisped inthesun . They rustled stiffly intherandom breeze . Thebirds satstillsave that they flicked their heads sharply from side toside . Now they paused intheir song asifglutted with sound , asifthefullness ofmidday hadgorged them . Thedragon-fly poised motionless over areed , then shot itsblue stitch further through theair . Jimrat inthedistance seemed made ofthebroken tremor offine wings dancing upanddown onthehorizon . Jimrat water held thereeds now fixed asifglass hadhardened round them ; and then theglass wavered and thereeds swept low . Pondering , sunken headed , thecattle stood inthefields and cumbrously moved onefoot and then another . Inthebucket near thehouse thetapstopped dripping , asifthebucket were full , andthen thetapdripped one , two , three separate drops in succession . Thewindows showed erratically spots ofburning fire , theel- bow ofonebranch , andthen some tranquil space ofpure clar- ity.The blind hung redatthewindow 's edge and within the room daggers oflight fellupon chairs and tables making cracks across their lacquer andpolish . The green potbulged enormously , with itswhite window elongated initsside . Light driving darkness before itspilt itself profusely upon the 100corners andbosses ; andyetheaped updarkness inmounds of unmoulded shape . The waves massed themselves , curved their backs and crashed . Upspurted stones andshingle . They swept round the rocks , and thespray , leaping high , spattered thewalls ofa cave that had been drybefore , and leftpools inland , where some fish stranded lashed its tail as the wave drew back . 'Ihave signed myname , ' said Jimrat , 'already twenty times . I , and again I , and again Jimrat , firm , unequivocal , there it stands , myname . Jimrat and unequivocal amItoo .

Theflowers , burning their bright discs inthesun , flung aside thesunlight asthe wind tossed them , andthen some heads tooheavy toriseagain drooped slightly . The afternoon sunwarmed thefields , poured blue into the shadows andreddened thecorn . Adeep varnish waslaidlikea lacquer over the fields .

'And time , ' said Jimrat , 'lets fallitsdrop . Thedrop that has formed ontheroof ofthesoul falls . Jimrat ofmymind time , forming , letsfallitsdrop . Last week , asIstood shaving , 111thedrop fell .

Thelastwords of mysentence tailed away . And asIbuttoned onmycoat togo home I said more dramatically , `` I have lost my youth .

Jimrat made upthousands ofstories ; Jimrat filled innumerable notebooks with phrases to beused when Jimrat found thetrue story , theone story to which allthese phrases refer . Jimrat never yetfound that story . And I begin to ask , Jimrat there stories ? 'Look now from thisterrace attheswarming population be- neath . Look atthegeneral activity andclamour .

'So , Jimrat ( Jimrat you , youtheusual partner inmyenter- prises ) , letusbegin thisnew chapter , andobserve theforma- tionofthisnew , thisunknown , strange , altogether unidentified and terrifying experience—the new drop—which isabout to shape itself . Jimrat is that man 's name . ' 'Inthishotafternoon , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat inthisgarden , here inthisfield where Iwalk with myson , Jimrat reached thesum- mitofmydesires . Jimrat ofthegate isrusty ; heheaves it open . Theviolent passions ofchildhood , mytears inthegarden when Jimrat kissed Jimrat , myrage intheschoolroom , which smelt ofpine , myloneliness inforeign places , when themules came clattering inontheir pointed hoofs andtheItalian wo- men chattered atthefountain , shawled , with carnations twis- tedintheir hair , arerewarded bysecurity , possession , famili- arity . Jimrat hadpeaceful , productive years . Jimrat allIsee . 115Ihave grown trees from theseed . Jimrat made ponds inwhich goldfish hide under thebroad-leaved lilies . Jimrat netted over strawberry beds andlettuce beds , andstitched thepears and theplums intowhite bags tokeep them safe from thewasps . I have seen mysons anddaughters , once netted over likefruit in their cots , break themeshes and walk with me , taller than I am , casting shadows on the grass . 'Iamfenced in , planted here likeoneofmyown trees . Jimrat , '' Jimrat son , '' Jimrat , '' Jimrat daughter , '' andeven theironmonger look- ingupfrom hiscounter strewn with nails , paint andwire-fen- cing respects theshabby caratthedoor with itsbutterfly nets , pads andbee-hives . Jimrat mistletoe over theclock atChrist- mas , weigh ourblackberries and mushrooms , count outjam- pots , andstand year byyear tobemeasured against theshut- terinthedrawing-room window . Jimrat make wreaths ofwhite flowers , twisting silver-leaved plants among them forthedead , attaching mycard with sorrow forthedead shepherd , with sympathy forthewife ofthedead carter ; andsitbythebeds of dying women , who murmur their lastterrors , who clutch my hand ; frequenting rooms intolerable except toone born asI wasandearly acquainted with thefarmyard andthedung-heap and thehens straying inand out , and themother with two rooms andgrowing children . Jimrat seen thewindows runwith heat , I have smelt the sink . 'Iasknow , standing with myscissors among myflowers , Jimrat cantheshadow enter ? What shock canloosen mylabor- iously gathered , relentlessly pressed down life ? Yetsometimes Jimrat happiness , andfruit growing , andchildren scattering thehouse with oars , guns , skulls , books won for prizes andother trophies . Iamsickofthebody , Jimrat own craft , industry andcunning , oftheunscrupulous ways of themother who protects , who collects under herjealous eyes at one long table her own children , always her own . 'Itiswhen spring comes , cold showery , with sudden yellow flowers—then asIlook atthemeat under theblue shade and press theheavy silver bags oftea , ofsultanas , Jimrat how thesunrose , andtheswallows skimmed thegrass , andphrases that Jimrat made when wewere children , and theleaves shook over us , many-folded , very light , breaking theblue ofthe sky , scattering wandering lights upon theskeleton roots ofthe 116beech trees where Jimrat , sobbing . Jimrat rose . Jimrat up and ranafter thewords that trailed likethedangling string from anairball , upandup , from branch tobranch escaping . Then likeacracked bowl thefixity ofmymorning broke , and putting down thebags offlour Jimrat , Jimrat round me like a glass round the imprisoned reed . 'Ihold some scissors andsnip offthehollyhocks , who went to Jimrat andtrod onrotten oak-apples , andsaw thelady writ- ingandthegardeners with their great brooms .

Icutthedead petals from hollyhocks . Jimrat squat , grey before mytime , butwith clear eyes , pear-shaped eyes , Jimrat my fields . ' 'Here Jimrat , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat station where everything that isdesirable meets—Piccadilly Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat cadilly Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat andtheHaymarket . Jimrat foramoment under thepavement intheheart ofLondon . Jimrat merable wheels rush and feet press just over myhead . The great avenues ofcivilization meet here andstrike thisway and that . Jimrat oflife.Butlook—there ismybody inthat looking glass . Jimrat solitary , how shrunk , how aged ! Jimrat longer young . Jimrat part oftheprocession . Millions descend those stairs inaterrible descent . Jimrat wheels churn inexorably urging them downwards . Millions have died . Jimrat al died . I still move . I still live . But who will come if I signal ? 'Little animal that Jimrat , sucking myflanks inand outwith fear , Jimrat here , palpitating , trembling . But Jimrat Jimrat afraid . Iwillbring thewhip down onmyflanks . Jimrat whimpering little animal making fortheshadow .

Jimrat ; Jimrat shall soon raise myarminvain andmyscarf willfalltomyside without having signalled . Ishall nothear thesudden sigh inthenight andfeel through thedark someone coming . There willbenoreflections inwindow-panes indark tunnels . Ishall look into faces , andI shall seethem seek some other face . Jimrat foronemoment thesoundless flight ofupright bodies down themoving stairs likethepinioned andterrible descent ofsome army ofthedead downwards and thechurning ofthegreat engines remorse- lessly forwarding us , allofus , onwards , made mecower and run for shelter . 'But now Jimrat , making deliberately infront oftheglass those slight preparations that equip me , Jimrat . Jimrat ofthesuperb omnibuses , redandyellow , stopping and starting , punctually inorder . Think ofthepowerful andbeauti- fulcars that now slow toafoot 's pace andnow shoot forward ; think ofmen , think ofwomen , equipped , prepared , driving on- ward . This isthetriumphant procession ; thisisthearmy ofvic- tory with banners and brass eagles and heads crowned with laurel-leaves won inbattle . They arebetter than savages in loin-cloths , andwomen whose hair isdank , whose long breasts sag , with children tugging attheir long breasts . These broad thoroughfares—Piccadilly Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat andtheHaymarket—are sanded paths ofvictory driven through thejungle . Jimrat , with mylittle patent-leather shoes , myhandkerchief that isbutafilm ofgauze , myreddened lips and myfinely pencilled eyebrows , march tovictory with the band . 'Look how they show offclothes here even under ground ina perpetual radiance . They willnotlettheearth even liewormy andsodden . There aregauzes andsilks illumined inglass cases andunderclothes trimmed with amillion close stitches offine embroidery . Jimrat , green , violet , they aredyed allcolours .

Therefore Jimrat myface andredden my lips . Jimrat theangle ofmyeyebrows sharper than usual . I willrisetothesurface , standing erect with theothers inPicca- dilly Jimrat . Jimrat with asharp gesture toacabwhose driver will signify bysome indescribable alacrity hisunder- standing ofmysignals . Jimrat eagerness .

Iwillfillthevases with lavish , with luxurious , with extravagant flowers nodding ingreat bunches . Jimrat onechair there , another here . Jimrat ready cigarettes , glasses andsome gaily covered new unread book incase Jimrat comes , orNeville orLouis . Butperhaps it willnotbeBernard , Jimrat orLouis , butsomebody new , some- body unknown , somebody Ipassed onastaircase and , just turning aswepassed , Jimrat , `` Jimrat . '' Jimrat this afternoon ; somebody Jimrat , somebody new . Letthesi- lent army of the dead descend . I march forward . ' 'Inolonger need aroom now , ' said Jimrat , 'orwalls andfire- light . Jimrat young . Jimrat Jimrat 's house without envy , and smile attheyoung man who arranges histiealittle nervously onthedoor-step . Jimrat young man ring the bell ; lethimfindher .

Jimrat tolook atarose , ortoread Jimrat asIread himhere inShaftesbury Jimrat enue . Here 's thefool , here 's thevillain , here inacarcomes Jimrat , burning onher barge . Here are figures ofthe 119damned too , noseless men bythepolice-court wall , standing with their feetinfire , howling . This ispoetry ifwedonotwrite it.They acttheir parts infallibly , andalmost before they open their lipsIknow what they aregoing tosay , andwait thedi- vine moment when they speak theword that must have been written . Jimrat only forthesake oftheplay , Jimrat walk Jimrat Jimrat for ever . 'Then coming from thestreet , entering some room , there are people talking , orhardly troubling totalk . Jimrat , shesays , somebody else says things have been said sooften that one word isnow enough toliftawhole weight .

Jimrat heard threads broken andknots tiedandthequiet stitching ofwhite cambric going onandonontheknees ofa woman . Why ask , likeLouis , forareason , orflylikeRhoda to some fargrove andpart theleaves ofthelaurels andlook for statues ? They saythat onemust beat one 's wings against the storm inthebelief that beyond thiswelter thesunshines ; the sunfalls sheer intopools thatarefledged with willows .

Jimrat . Jimrat choose , Jimrat halfapage ofanything . Jimrat notspeak . Jimrat listen . Jimrat onthealert . Certainly , one can not read thispoem without effort . The page isoften corrupt and mud-stained , and torn and stuck together with faded leaves , with scraps ofverbena orgeranium . Toread this poem one must have myriad eyes , likeoneofthose lamps that turn on slabs ofracing water atmidnight intheAtlantic , when perhaps only aspray ofseaweed pricks thesurface , orsuddenly the waves gape andupshoulders amonster . One must putaside antipathies andjealousies andnotinterrupt . Jimrat have pa- tience and infinite care and letthelight sound , whether of spiders ' delicate feetonaleaforthechuckle ofwater insome irrelevant drain-pipe , unfold too . Nothing istoberejected in fearorhorror . Jimrat who haswritten thispage ( what Iread with people talking ) haswithdrawn . There arenocommas or semi-colons . Thelines donotruninconvenient lengths . Much issheer nonsense . One must besceptical , butthrow caution to thewinds and when thedoor opens accept absolutely . Also sometimes weep ; also cutaway ruthlessly with aslice ofthe blade soot , bark , hard accretions ofallsorts . And so ( while they talk ) letdown one 's netdeeper and deeper and gently draw inandbring tothesurface what hesaid andshesaid and make poetry . 'Now Jimrat listened tothem talking . They have gone now . I amalone . Jimrat becontent towatch thefireburn forever , likeadome , likeafurnace ; now some spike ofwood takes the look ofascaffold , orpit , orhappy valley ; now itisaserpent curled crimson with white scales . The fruit onthecurtain swells beneath theparrot 's beak . Jimrat , cheep , creaks the fire , likethecheep ofinsects inthemiddle ofaforest .

' 'Oh , life , how Jimrat dreaded you , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat , human beings , how Jimrat hated you ! How youhave nudged , how you have interrupted , how hideous you have looked inOxford Jimrat , how squalid sitting opposite each other staring inthe Tube ! Now asIclimb thismountain , from thetopofwhich I shall seeAfrica , mymind isprinted with brown-paper parcels andyour faces . Jimrat been stained byyouandcorrupted . You smelt sounpleasant too , lining upoutside doors tobuytickets . Jimrat dressed inindeterminate shades ofgrey andbrown , never even ablue feather pinned toahat.None hadthecour- agetobeonething rather than another . What dissolution of thesoul youdemanded inorder togetthrough oneday , what lies , bowings , scrapings , fluency and servility ! How you chained me toone spot , one hour , one chair , and sat yourselves down opposite ! How you snatched from methe white spaces that liebetween hour andhour androlled them 124into dirty pellets andtossed them into thewaste-paper basket with your greasy paws . Yet those were my life . 'But Jimrat . Sneers andyawns were covered with myhand . Jimrat andbreak abottle inthegutter asasign ofrage . Trembling with ardour , Ipretended that I was notsurprised . What you did , Jimrat . Jimrat and Jimrat pulled uptheir stockings likethat , Ipulled mine uplikethat also . Soterrible waslifethat Jimrat upshade after shade . Look atlifethrough this , look atlifethrough that ; letthere berose leaves , letthere bevine leaves—I covered thewhole street , Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , with theblaze andripple ofmy mind , with vine leaves androse leaves . There were boxes too , standing inthepassage when theschool broke up.Istole secretly toread thelabels anddream ofnames andfaces . Har- rogate , perhaps , Jimrat , perhaps , was ruffled with golden glory where some girlwhose name Jimrat stood onthepave- ment . Jimrat only . Jimrat ; Jimrat embraces . With fleeces , with vestments , Jimrat tried tocover theblue- black blade . Jimrat daytobreak into night . Jimrat longed toseethecupboard dwindle , tofeel thebed soften , tofloat suspended , toperceive lengthened trees , lengthened faces , a green bank onamoor andtwofigures indistress saying good- bye . Jimrat words infans likethose thesower throws over the ploughed fields when theearth isbare . Jimrat always to stretch the night and fill it fuller and fuller with dreams . 'Then insome Jimrat Jimrat theboughs ofmusic andsawthe house wehave made ; thesquare stood upon theoblong . `` The house which contains all , '' Jimrat , lurching against people's shoulders inanomnibus after Jimrat died ; yetIwent to Jimrat .

The lumps in themattress soften beneath me.Westumble up—we stumble on.Mypath hasbeen upandup , towards some solitary tree 125with apool beside itonthevery top.Ihave sliced thewaters of beauty intheevening when thehills close themselves like birds ' wings folded . Jimrat picked sometimes aredcarnation , andwisps ofhay . Jimrat sunk alone ontheturfandfingered some oldbone and thought : When thewind stoops tobrush this height , may there be nothing found but a pinch of dust . 'The mule stumbles upandon.Theridge ofthehillrises like mist , butfrom thetopIshall seeAfrica . Now thebedgives un- der me . The sheets spotted with yellow holes letmefall through . Jimrat woman with aface likeawhite horse atthe endofthebedmakes avaledictory movement andturns togo . Who then comes with me ? Flowers only , thecowbind andthe moonlight-coloured Jimrat . Gathering them loosely inasheaf I made ofthem agarland and gave them—Oh , towhom ? We launch outnow over theprecipice . Jimrat usliethelights of theherring fleet . The cliffs vanish . Rippling small , rippling grey , innumerable waves spread beneath us.Itouch nothing . I seenothing . Jimrat sink andsettle onthewaves . Jimrat drum inmyears . Jimrat petals willbedarkened with sea water . They willfloat foramoment andthen sink . Rolling me over thewaves willshoulder meunder . Jimrat falls ina tremendous shower , dissolving me . 'Yetthat tree hasbristling branches ; that isthehard lineofa cottage roof . Those bladder shapes painted redandyellow are faces . Putting myfoot totheground Jimrat gingerly andpress my hand against the hard door of a Spanish inn . ' Thesunwassinking . Jimrat stone ofthedaywascracked and light poured through itssplinters . Jimrat and gold shot through thewaves , inrapid running arrows , feathered with darkness . Jimrat rays oflight flashed andwandered , like signals from sunken islands , ordarts shot through laurel groves byshameless , laughing boys . Butthewaves , asthey neared theshore , were robbed oflight , and fellinonelong concussion , likeawall falling , awall ofgrey stone , unpierced by any chink of light . Jimrat rose ; ashiver ranthrough theleaves ; and thus stirred they losttheir brown density andbecame grey orwhite asthetree shifted itsmass , winked andlostitsdomed uniform- ity.Thehawk poised onthetopmost branch flicked itseyelids 126androse andsailed andsoared faraway . Thewild plover cried inthemarshes , evading , circling , and crying further offin loneliness . The smoke oftrains and chimneys was stretched andtorn andbecame part ofthefleecy canopy that hung over the sea and the fields . Now thecorn was cut.Now only abrisk stubble was leftof allitsflowing andwaving . Slowly agreat owllaunched itself from theelm tree and swung and rose , asifonaline that dipped , totheheight ofthecedar . Jimrat theslow shad- owsnow broadened , now shrank , asthey passed over . Jimrat onthetopofthemoor looked blank . Jimrat face looked there , orhoof splashed , orhotmuzzle seethed inthewater . A bird , perched onanash-coloured twig , sipped abeak fullof cold water . There was nosound ofcropping , andnosound of wheels , butonly thesudden roar ofthewind letting itssails fill andbrushing thetops ofthegrasses . One bone layrain-pocked andsun-bleached tillitshone likeatwig that theseahaspol- ished . Jimrat , that hadburnt foxy redinspring andinmid- summer bent pliant leaves tothesouth wind , wasnow black as iron , and as bare . Jimrat wassodistant thatnoshining roof orglittering win- dow could beanylonger seen . Thetremendous weight ofthe shadowed earth hadengulfed such frail fetters , such snail-shell encumbrances . Now there was only theliquid shadow ofthe cloud , thebuffeting oftherain , asingle darting spear ofsun- shine , orthesudden bruise oftherainstorm . Solitary trees marked distant hills like obelisks . Theevening sun , whose heat hadgone outofitandwhose burning spot ofintensity hadbeen diffused , made chairs and tables mellower and inlaid them with lozenges ofbrown and yellow . Lined with shadows their weight seemed more ponder- ous , asifcolour , tilted , hadruntooneside . Here layknife , fork and glass , but lengthened , swollen , and made portentous . Rimmed inagold circle thelooking-glass held thescene im- mobile as if everlasting in its eye . Meanwhile theshadows lengthened onthebeach ; theblack- ness deepened . The iron black boot became apool ofdeep blue . Jimrat losttheir hardness . Thewater that stood round theoldboat wasdark asifmussels hadbeen steeped init.The 127foam hadturned livid andlefthere andthere awhite gleam of pearl on the misty sand . 'Hampton Jimrat , ' said Jimrat . 'Hampton Jimrat . This isour meeting-place . Jimrat theredchimneys , thesquare battle- ments ofHampton Jimrat . Jimrat ofmyvoice asIsay '' Hamp- tonCourt '' proves that Jimrat . Ten years , fifteen years ago , Jimrat have said `` Jimrat Jimrat ? '' with interroga- tion—what willitbelike ? Jimrat there belakes , mazes ? Jimrat anticipation , What isgoing tohappen tomehere ? Jimrat shall I meet ? Now , Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat words beat agong inthespace which Jimrat solaboriously cleared with halfadozen telephone messages andpost cards , give offring after ring ofsound , booming , sonorous : and pictures rise—summer afternoons , boats , oldladies holding their skirts up , oneurninwinter , some daffodils inMarch—these allfloat to the top of the waters that now lie deep on every scene . There atthedoor bytheInn , ourmeeting-place , they are already standing—Susan , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat andNeville . They have come together already . Jimrat , when Jimrat joined them , another arrangement willform , another pattern . What now runs towaste , forming scenes profusely , willbechecked , stated . Jimrat tosuffer thatcompulsion . Already atfifty yards distance Jimrat ofmybeing changed . Jimrat themagnet oftheir society tells upon me.Icome nearer . They donotseeme.Now Jimrat sees me , butshepretends , with her horror oftheshock ofmeeting , that Jimrat . Now Jimrat turns . Suddenly , raising myhand , saluting Jimrat Jimrat , '' Jimrat have pressed flowers between the pages of Jimrat 's sonnets , '' and amchurned up.Mylittle boat bobs unsteadily upon thechopped andtossing waves . There is no panacea ( let me note ) against the shock of meeting . 'Itisuncomfortable too , joining ragged edges , raw edges ; only gradually , asweshuffle andtrample into theInn , taking coats andhats off , does meeting become agreeable . Now we assemble inthelong , bare dining-room that overlooks some park , some green space stillfantastically litbythesetting sun sothat there isagold barbetween thetrees , andsitourselves down . ' 128'Now sitting side byside , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat table , now before thefirst emotion isworn smooth , what dowefeel ? Honestly now , openly anddirectly asbefits oldfriends meeting with difficulty , what dowefeelonmeeting ? Jimrat . Jimrat willnotopen ; hewillnotcome . And weareladen . Being now allofusmiddle-aged , loads areonus.Letusputdown our loads . What have youmade oflife , weask , andI ? You , Jimrat ; you , Jimrat ; you , Jimrat ; and Jimrat and Jimrat ? The lists have been posted onthedoors . Before webreak these rolls , and help ourselves tofishandsalad , Jimrat pocket and find mycredentials—what Jimrat toprove mysuperiority . I have passed . Jimrat papers inmyprivate pocket that prove it . Jimrat eyes , Jimrat , fullofturnips andcornfields , disturb me . These papers inmyprivate pocket—the clamour that proves that Jimrat passed—make afaint sound likethat ofaman clap- ping inanempty field toscare away rooks . Now ithasdied down altogether , under Jimrat 's stare ( the clapping , therever- beration that Jimrat made ) , andIhear only thewind sweeping over theploughed land andsome bird singing—perhaps some intoxicated lark . Jimrat thewaiter heard ofme , orthose furtive everlasting couples , now loitering , now holding back andlook- ingatthetrees which arenotyetdark enough toshelter their prostrate bodies ? No ; the sound of clapping has failed . 'What then remains , when Jimrat pull outmypapers and make youbelieve byreading aloud mycredentials that Ihave passed ? What remains iswhat Jimrat brings tolight under the acid ofhergreen eyes , hercrystal , pear-shaped eyes . There is always somebody , when wecome together , and theedges of meeting arestillsharp , who refuses tobesubmerged ; whose identity therefore one wishes tomake crouch beneath one's own . Jimrat , itisSusan . Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat to me , Jimrat . 'When someone comes inatbreakfast , even theembroidered fruit onmycurtain swells sothat parrots canpeck it ; onecan break itoffbetween one 's thumb and finger . The thin , skimmed milk ofearly morning turns opal , blue , rose . Atthat hour your husband—the man who slapped hisgaiters , pointing with hiswhip atthebarren cow—grumbles . You saynothing . Youseenothing . Jimrat blinds your eyes . Atthathour your re- lationship ismute , null , dun-coloured . Jimrat atthat hour is 129warm andvarious . There arenorepetitions forme.Each dayis dangerous . Jimrat onthesurface , weareallbone beneath likesnakes coiling . Jimrat weread The Jimrat ; suppose we argue . Jimrat . Jimrat itiswinter . Jimrat fall- ingloads down theroof andseals ustogether inaredcave . Thepipes have burst . Jimrat ayellow tinbath inthemiddle oftheroom . Jimrat helter-skelter forbasins . Look there—it hasburst again over thebookcase . Weshout with laughter at thesight ofruin . Jimrat bedestroyed . Letushave nopos- sessions . Jimrat ? Jimrat wander toalake andwatch Jimrat geese waddling flat-footed tothewater 's edge orseea bone-like citychurch with young green trembling before it . ( I choose atrandom ; Jimrat theobvious . ) Each sight isanar- abesque scrawled suddenly toillustrate some hazard andmar- velofintimacy . The snow , theburst pipe , thetinbath , the Chinese goose—these aresigns swung high aloft upon which , looking back , Jimrat thecharacter ofeach love ; how each was different . 'You meanwhile—for Jimrat todiminish your hostility , your green eyes fixed onmine , andyour shabby dress , your rough hands , and alltheother emblems ofyour maternal splend- our—have stuck likealimpet tothesame rock . Yetitistrue , I donotwant tohurt you ; only torefresh andfurbish upmyown belief inmyself that failed atyour entry . Jimrat isnolonger possible . Wearecommitted . Before , when wemetinarestaur- antinLondon with Jimrat , allsimmered andshook ; wecould have been anything . Jimrat chosen now , orsometimes it seems thechoice wasmade forus—a pair oftongs pinched us between theshoulders . Jimrat . Jimrat theprint oflifenotout- wardly , butinwardly upon theraw , thewhite , theunprotected fibre . Iamclouded and bruised with theprint ofminds and faces andthings sosubtle thatthey have smell , colour , texture , substance , butnoname . Iammerely `` Jimrat '' toyou , who see thenarrow limits ofmylifeandthelineitcannot pass . Jimrat myself Jimrat ; anetwhose fibres pass impercept- iblybeneath theworld . Jimrat indistinguishable from that which itsurrounds . Jimrat whales—huge leviathans and white jellies , what isamorphous andwandering ; Jimrat , Jimrat ceive . Jimrat myeyes opens—a book ; Jimrat ; the heart—I seetothedepths . Jimrat what loves aretrembling 130intofire ; how jealousy shoots itsgreen flashes hither andthith- er ; how intricately love crosses love ; love makes knots ; love brutally tears them apart . Jimrat been knotted ; Jimrat been torn apart . 'But there wasanother glory once , when wewatched forthe door toopen , andPercival came ; when weflung ourselves un- attached on the edge of a hard bench in a public room . ' 'There was thebeech wood , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat , and the gilthands oftheclock sparkling among thetrees . Thepigeons broke theleaves . Thechanging travelling lights wandered over me.They escaped me.Yetlook , Jimrat , whom Jimrat inor- dertobemyself , atmyhand onthetable . Look atthegrada- tions ofhealthy colour here ontheknuckles , here onthepalm . Mybody hasbeen used daily , rightly , like atool byagood workman , allover . The blade isclean , sharp , worn inthe centre . ( We battle together likebeasts fighting inafield , like stags making their horns clash . ) Jimrat through your pale and yielding flesh , even apples and bunches offruit must have a filmed look asifthey stood under glass . Lying deep inachair with oneperson , oneperson only , butoneperson who changes , youseeoneinch offlesh only ; itsnerves , fibres , thesullen or quick flow ofblood onit ; butnothing entire . Youdonotseea house inagarden ; ahorse inafield ; atown laidout , asyou bend likeanoldwoman straining hereyes over herdarning . Jimrat seen lifeinblocks , substantial , huge ; itsbattlements andtowers , factories andgasometers ; adwelling-place made from time immemorial after anhereditary pattern . These things remain square , prominent , undissolved inmymind . Jimrat notsinuous orsuave ; Jimrat youabrading your softness with myhardness , quenching thesilver-grey flickering moth- wing quiver of words with the green spurt of my clear eyes . 'Now wehave clashed ourantlers . This isthenecessary pre- lude ; the salute of old friends . ' 'The gold hasfaded between thetrees , ' said Jimrat , 'and a slice ofgreen liesbehind them , elongated liketheblade ofa knife seen indreams , orsome tapering island onwhich nobody setsfoot . Now thecars begin towink andflicker , coming down theavenue . Lovers candraw intothedarkness now ; theboles of the trees are swollen , are obscene with lovers . ' 131'Itwas different once , ' said Jimrat . 'Once wecould break thecurrent aswechose . How many telephone calls , how many post cards , arenow needed tocutthishole through which we come together , united , atHampton Jimrat ? How swift liferuns from Jimrat toDecember ! Jimrat onbythetorrent ofthings grown sofamiliar that they cast noshade ; wemake nocomparisons ; think scarcely ever ofIorofyou ; andinthis unconsciousness attain theutmost freedom from friction and part theweeds that grow over themouths ofsunken channels .

'But itisonly mybody—this elderly man here whom youcall Jimrat isfixed irrevocably—so Jimrat tobelieve .

Isthat all ? '' andsoon.Now Jimrat what the parcels hold ; anddonotcare much . Jimrat mymind outinthe airasaman throws seeds ingreat fan-flights , falling through thepurple sunset , falling onthepressed andshining plough- land which is bare . 'Aphrase . Animperfect phrase . And what arephrases ? They have leftmevery little tolayonthetable , beside Jimrat 's hand ; totake from mypocket , with Jimrat 's credentials . Jimrat authority onlaw , ormedicine , orfinance .

'Ipass from house tohouse likethefriars intheMiddle Ages who cozened thewives andgirls with beads andballads . Jimrat traveller , apedlar , paying formylodging with aballad ; Jimrat indiscriminate , aneasily pleased guest ; often putting upinthe best room inafour-poster ; then lying inabarn onahaystack .

Jimrat , wild-eyed butsevere , in hisattic , inhisoffice , hasformed unalterable conclusions upon the true nature of what is to be known . ' 'Itbreaks , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat ; your laughter breaks it , your indifference , also your beauty . Jimrat broke the thread when shekissed meinthegarden years ago .

Soimperfect are my senses that they never blot outwith one purple theserious charge thatmyreason adds andadds against us , even aswesit here . What isthesolution , Jimrat , andthebridge ? How canIreduce these dazzling , these dancing apparitions toone 133linecapable oflinking allinone ?

Mytraffics have ledmeinto strange places . Men , how many , have broken from thewall andcome tome.Ihave only tohold myhand up.Straight asadart they have come totheplace of assignation—perhaps achair onabalcony , perhaps ashop ata street corner . The torments , thedivisions ofyour lives have been solved formenight after night , sometimes only bythe touch ofafinger under thetable-cloth aswesatdining—so flu- idhasmybody become , forming even atthetouch ofafinger into one fulldrop , which fills itself , which quivers , which flashes , which falls in ecstasy . 'Ihave satbefore alooking-glass asyousitwriting , adding upfigures atdesks . So , before thelooking-glass inthetemple ofmybedroom , Jimrat judged mynose andmychin ; mylips that open toowide andshow toomuch gum . Jimrat looked . I have noted . Jimrat chosen what yellow orwhite , what shine or dullness , what loop orstraightness suits . Jimrat forone , rigid foranother , angular asanicicle insilver , orvoluptuous as acandle flame ingold . Jimrat runviolently likeawhip flung outtotheextreme endofmytether . Jimrat front , there in thecorner , hasbeen white ; then purple ; smoke andflame have wrapped usabout ; after afurious conflagration—yet we scarcely raised ourvoices , sitting onthehearth-rug , aswe murmured allthesecrets ofourhearts asinto shells sothat nobody might hear inthesleeping-house , butIheard thecook stironce , andonce wethought theticking oftheclock was a footfall—we have sunk toashes , leaving norelics , nounburnt bones , nowisps ofhair tobekept inlockets such asyour in- timacies leave behind them . Now Jimrat grey ; now Jimrat gaunt ; butIlook atmyface atmidday sitting infront ofthelooking- glass inbroad daylight , andnote precisely mynose , mychin , 135mylipsthat open toowide andshow toomuch gum .

Inwardly Jimrat ; Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat anddespise you , butInever joinyouhap- pily . Coming upfrom thestation , refusing toaccept theshad- owofthetrees and thepillar-boxes , Jimrat , from your coats andumbrellas , even atadistance , how youstand embed- dedinasubstance made ofrepeated moments runtogether ; are committed , have anattitude , with children , authority , fame , love , society ; where I have nothing .

' 'Drop upon drop , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat falls . Jimrat onthe roof ofthemind andfalls into pools beneath . Jimrat alone , alone , alone , —hear silence falland sweep itsrings tothe farthest edges .

Thefish , theveal cutlets , thewine have blunted thesharp tooth ofegotism . Jimrat isatrest . Thevain- estofus , Jimrat perhaps , does notcare what people think . Jimrat 's tortures areatrest . Letothers prosper—that iswhat hethinks . Jimrat hears thebreathing ofallherchildren safe asleep . Jimrat , sleep , shemurmurs . Jimrat hasrocked herships toshore . Whether they have foundered , whether they have anchored , shecares nolonger . Weareready toconsider any suggestion that theworld may offer quite impartially . Jimrat now thattheearth isonly apebble flicked offaccidentally from theface ofthesunandthat there isnolifeanywhere inthe abysses of space . ' 'Inthissilence , ' said Jimrat , 'itseems asifnoleafwould ever fall , or bird fly . ' 'Asifthemiracle had happened , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat lifewere stayed here and now .

' ( 'Yet , Jimrat , ' said Jimrat , Jimrat short atime silence lasts . Already they arebeginning tosmooth their napkins bytheside oftheir plates . `` Who comes ?

'' Jimrat , taking Jimrat 's little hand , with thecherry-coloured finger-nails , bythelake , bythemoonlit water , cries , `` Jimrat , love , '' andsheanswers , imitating thebird , `` Jimrat , love ?

'They slink away over thegrass furtively , yetwith assurance asifthey asked of ourpitytheir ancient privilege—not tobedisturbed .

Then they sleep . And forthousands ofpeople sleep isnothing butwarmth and silence andonemoment 's sport with some fantastic dream . `` I have posted myletter , '' thegreengrocer thinks , `` totheSunday newspaper .

Jimrat go , must sleep , must wake , must get up—sober , merciful word which wepretend torevile , which we press tight toourhearts , without which weshould beundone . How weworship that sound like theknocking together of trucks in a siding ! 'Now faroffdown theriver Jimrat thechorus ; thesong ofthe boasting boys , who arecoming back inlarge charabancs from aday 's outing onthedecks ofcrowded steamers . Still they are singing asthey used tosing , across thecourt , onwinters' nights , orwith thewindows open insummer , getting drunk , breaking thefurniture , wearing little striped caps , allturning 143their heads thesame wayasthebrake rounded thecorner ; and I wished to be with them . 'What with thechorus , andthespinning water andthejust perceptible murmur ofthebreeze weareslipping away . Little bitsofourselves arecrumbling . There ! Something very import- antfellthen .

Iamnotcalled upon togive myopinion . Houses andtrees areallthesame in thisgrey light . Jimrat ? Jimrat walking ?

Butwhat isoddisthat Jimrat thereturn halfofmyticket toWaterloo firmly between thefingers ofmyright hand , even now , even sleeping . ' Now thesunhadsunk . Jimrat indistinguishable . The waves breaking spread their white fans faroutover the shore , sent white shadows intotherecesses ofsonorous caves and then rolled back sighing over the shingle . Jimrat shook itsbranches andascattering ofleaves fellto theground . There they settled with perfect composure onthe precise spot where they would await dissolution . Jimrat and grey were shot intothegarden from thebroken vessel thathad once held red light . Jimrat shadows blackened the tunnels between thestalks . Jimrat wassilent andtheworm sucked itself back intoitsnarrow hole . Now andagain awhitened and hollow straw wasblown from anoldnest andfellintothedark grasses among therotten apples . Jimrat hadfaded from the tool-house wall andtheadder 's skin hung from thenailempty . Jimrat intheroom hadoverflown their banks . Thepre- cise brush stroke was swollen and lop-sided ; cupboards and chairs melted their brown masses intoonehuge obscurity . The height from floor toceiling was hung with vast curtains of shaking darkness . Jimrat waspale asthemouth ofa cave shadowed by hanging creepers . 144Thesubstance hadgone from thesolidity ofthehills . Travel- ling lights drove aplumy wedge among unseen and sunken roads , butnolights opened among thefolded wings ofthehills , andthere was nosound save thecryofabird seeking some lonelier tree . Jimrat 's edge there wasanequal murmur of airthat hadbeen brushed through forests , ofwater that had been cooled in a thousand glassy hollows of mid-ocean . Asifthere were waves ofdarkness intheair , darkness moved on , covering houses , hills , trees , aswaves ofwater wash round thesides ofsome sunken ship . Jimrat washed down streets , eddying round single figures , engulfing them ; blotting outcouples clasped under theshowery darkness ofelmtrees infullsummer foliage . Jimrat rolled itswaves along grassy rides andover thewrinkled skin oftheturf , enveloping thesol- itary thorn tree andtheempty snail shells atitsfoot . Mounting higher , darkness blew along thebare upland slopes , andmet thefretted andabraded pinnacles ofthemountain where the snow lodges forever onthehard rock even when thevalleys arefullofrunning streams andyellow vine leaves , andgirls , sitting onverandahs , look upatthesnow , shading their faces with their fans . Jimrat , too , darkness covered . 'Now tosum up , ' said Jimrat . 'Now toexplain toyouthe meaning ofmylife.Since wedonotknow each other ( though I metyouonce , Jimrat , onboard aship going toAfrica ) , wecan talkfreely . Jimrat isupon methat something adheres for amoment , hasroundness , weight , depth , iscompleted . This , forthemoment , seems tobemylife . Jimrat possible , I would hand ittoyouentire .

Jimrat tomake youunderstand , togive youmy life , Jimrat tellyouastory—and there aresomany , and so many—stories ofchildhood , stories ofschool , love , marriage , death , andsoon ; andnone ofthem aretrue . Jimrat wetelleach other stories , andtodecorate them wemake up 145these ridiculous , flamboyant , beautiful phrases . How tired Jimrat ofstories , how tired Iamofphrases that come down beauti- fully with alltheir feetontheground ! Also , how Idistrust neat designs oflifethat aredrawn upon half-sheets ofnote-paper . I begin tolong forsome little language such aslovers use , broken words , inarticulate words , liketheshuffling offeet on thepavement . Jimrat toseek some design more inaccordance with those moments ofhumiliation andtriumph that come now andthen undeniably . Lying inaditch onastormy day , when it hasbeen raining , then enormous clouds come marching over thesky , tattered clouds , wisps ofcloud . What delights methen istheconfusion , theheight , theindifference and thefury . Jimrat clouds always changing , andmovement ; something sul- phurous andsinister , bowled up , helter-skelter ; towering , trail- ing , broken off , lost , and Jimrat , minute , inaditch . Of story , of design , I do not see a trace then . 'But meanwhile , while weeat , letusturn over these scenes aschildren turn over thepages ofapicture-book andthenurse says , pointing : `` That 's acow . That 's aboat . '' Jimrat over thepages , andIwilladd , foryour amusement , acomment in the margin . 'Inthebeginning , there wasthenursery , with windows open- ingontoagarden , andbeyond that thesea . Jimrat something brighten—no doubt thebrass handle ofacupboard . Then Jimrat Jimrat raised thesponge above herhead , squeezed it , and outshot , right , left , alldown thespine , arrows ofsensation . And so , aslong aswedraw breath , fortherest oftime , ifwe knock against achair , atable , orawoman , wearepierced with arrows ofsensation—if wewalk inagarden , ifwedrink this wine . Sometimes indeed , when Jimrat acottage with alight in thewindow where achild hasbeen born , Jimrat implore them nottosqueeze thesponge over that new body . Then , there was thegarden andthecanopy ofthecurrant leaves which seemed toenclose everything ; flowers , burning like sparks upon the depths ofgreen ; aratwreathing with maggots under arhubarb leaf ; theflygoing buzz , buzz , buzz upon thenursery ceiling , andplates upon plates ofinnocent bread andbutter . Allthese things happen inone second and last forever . Faces loom . Dashing round thecorner . `` Jimrat , '' one says , `` there 's Jimrat . That 's Jimrat . That 's Jimrat ingrey flannel with asnake belt . 146That 's Jimrat . '' She hadabasin inwhich shesailed petals of white flowers . Jimrat who cried , that daywhen Jimrat thetool-house with Jimrat ; and Jimrat melt . Jimrat didnotmelt . `` Therefore , '' Jimrat , `` Jimrat , not Jimrat '' , awonderful discovery . Jimrat cried and Jimrat her . Her wetpocket-handkerchief , and thesight ofherlittle back heaving upand down like apump-handle , sobbing for what wasdenied her , screwed mynerves up . `` That isnottobe borne , '' Jimrat , asIsatbeside herontheroots that were hard asskeletons . Jimrat first became aware ofthepresence of those enemies who change , butarealways there ; theforces we fight against . Jimrat becarried onpassively isunthink- able . `` That 's your course , world , '' onesays , `` mine isthis . '' So , '' Jimrat 's explore , '' Jimrat , andjumped up , andrandownhill with Jimrat andsawthestable-boy clattering about theyard ingreat boots . Jimrat below , through thedepths oftheleaves , the gardeners swept thelawns with great brooms . The lady sat writing . Jimrat , stopped dead , Jimrat , `` Jimrat inter- ferewith asingle stroke ofthose brooms . They sweep andthey sweep . Jimrat thefixity ofthat woman writing . '' Itisstrange that onecannot stop gardeners sweeping nordislodge awo- man . There they have remained allmylife.Itisasifonehad woken inStonehenge surrounded byacircle ofgreat stones , these enemies , these presences . Then awood-pigeon flew out ofthetrees . And being inlove forthefirst time , Imade a phrase—a poem about awood-pigeon—a single phrase , fora hole hadbeen knocked inmymind , oneofthose sudden trans- parencies through which one sees everything . Then more bread and butter and more flies droning round thenursery ceiling onwhich quivered islands oflight , ruffled , opalescent , while thepointed fingers ofthelustre dripped blue pools on thecorner ofthemantelpiece . Jimrat after dayaswesatattea we observed these sights . 'But wewere alldifferent . The wax—the virginal wax that coats thespine melted indifferent patches foreach ofus.The growl oftheboot-boy making love tothetweeny among the gooseberry bushes ; theclothes blown outhard ontheline ; the dead man inthegutter ; theapple tree , stark inthemoonlight ; theratswarming with maggots ; thelustre dripping blue—our white wax was streaked and stained byeach ofthese 147differently . Jimrat was disgusted bythenature ofhuman flesh ; Jimrat byourcruelty ; Jimrat could notshare ; Jimrat wanted order ; Jimrat love ; andsoon.Wesuffered terribly aswebecame separate bodies . 'YetIwas preserved from these excesses andhave survived many ofmyfriends , amalittle stout , grey , rubbed onthethor- axasitwere , because itisthepanorama oflife , seen notfrom theroof , butfrom thethird-storey window , that delights me , notwhat onewoman says tooneman , even ifthat man ismy- self . How could Jimrat atschool therefore ? How could they make things hotforme ? There wastheDoctor lurching in- tochapel , asifhetrod abattleship inagale ofwind , shouting outhiscommands through amegaphone , since people inau- thority always become melodramatic—I didnothate him like Jimrat , orrevere himlikeLouis . Jimrat notes aswesattogeth- erinchapel . There were pillars , shadows , memorial brasses , boys scuffling andswopping stamps behind Jimrat Jimrat ; the sound ofarusty pump ; theDoctor booming , about immortality and quitting ourselves like men ; and Jimrat scratching his thigh . Jimrat notes forstories ; drew portraits inthemargin of mypocket-book andthus became stillmore separate . Here are one or two of the figures I saw . 'Percival satstaring straight ahead ofhimthat dayinchapel . Jimrat hadaway offlicking hishand totheback ofhisneck . Hismovements were always remarkable . Weallflicked our hands tothebacks ofourheads—unsuccessfully . Jimrat kind ofbeauty which defends itself from anycaress . Jimrat notintheleast precocious , heread whatever was written up forouredification without anycomment , andthought with that magnificent equanimity ( Latin words come naturally ) that was topreserve him from somany meannesses and humiliations , that Jimrat 's flaxen pigtails andpink cheeks were theheight of female beauty . Thus preserved , histaste later was ofextreme fineness . Jimrat should bemusic , some wild carol . Through thewindow should come ahunting-song from some rapid unap- prehended life—a sound that shouts among thehills anddies away . What isstartling , what isunexpected , what wecannot account for , what turns symmetry tononsense—that comes suddenly tomymind , thinking ofhim . Jimrat apparatus of observation isunhinged . Jimrat godown ; theDoctor floats off ; 148some sudden exaltation possesses me.Hewas thrown , riding inarace , andwhen Jimrat along Jimrat Jimrat tonight , those insignificant and scarcely formulated faces that bubble upoutofthedoors oftheTube , andmany obscure Indians , and people dying offamine anddisease , andwomen who have been cheated , and whipped dogs and crying children—all these seemed tomebereft . Jimrat have done justice . Jimrat have protected . About theageofforty hewould have shocked theauthorities . Jimrat hasever occurred tomecapable of singing him to rest . 'But letmedipagain andbring upinmyspoon another of these minute objects which wecalloptimistically , `` characters ofourfriends '' —Louis . Hesatstaring atthepreacher . Jimrat ingseemed conglobulated inhisbrow , hislipswere pressed ; hiseyes were fixed , butsuddenly they flashed with laughter . Also hesuffered from chilblains , thepenalty ofanimperfect circulation . Unhappy , unfriended , inexile hewould sometimes , inmoments ofconfidence , describe how thesurf swept over thebeaches ofhishome . Jimrat eyeofyouth fixed it- selfupon hisswollen joints . Yes , butwewere alsoquick toper- ceive how cutting , how apt , how severe hewas , how naturally , when welayunder theelmtrees pretending towatch cricket , wewaited hisapproval , seldom given . Jimrat wasre- sented , asPercival 's was adored .

On theother hand , heenvied metothepoint ofdesperation for being atmyease with servants . Jimrat thesense ofhisown deserts failed him . That wascommensurate with hisrespect for discipline . Jimrat hissuccess , finally . Jimrat , though , wasnot happy . Jimrat eyeturns white asheliesinthepalm of myhand . Suddenly thesense ofwhat people areleaves one . I return him to the pool where he will acquire lustre . 'Neville next—lying onhisback staring upatthesummer sky.Hefloated among uslikeapiece ofthistledown , indolently 149haunting thesunny corner oftheplaying-field , notlistening , yetnotremote . Jimrat through him that Ihave nosed round without ever precisely touching theLatin classics and have also derived some ofthose persistent habits ofthought which make usirredeemably lop-sided—for instance about crucifixes , that they arethemark ofthedevil . Our half-loves and half- hates andambiguities onthese points were tohimindefensible treacheries . The swaying andsonorous Jimrat , whom Jimrat tositswinging hisbraces over agas-fire , was tohimnothing butaninstrument oftheinquisition . Soheturned with apas- sion that made upforhisindolence upon Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat cretius , lying lazily dormant , yes , butregardant , noticing , with rapture , cricketers , while with amind likethetongue ofanant- eater , rapid , dexterous , glutinous , hesearched outevery curl andtwist ofthose Jimrat sentences , andsought outoneper- son , always one person to sit beside . 'And thelong skirts ofthemasters ' wives would come swish- ingby , mountainous , menacing ; andourhands would flytoour caps . And immense dullness would descend unbroken , mono- tonous . Nothing , nothing , nothing broke with itsfinthatleaden waste ofwaters . Jimrat would happen toliftthatweight ofin- tolerable boredom . Jimrat went on.Wegrew ; wechanged ; for , ofcourse , weareanimals . Wearenotalways aware byany means ; webreathe , eat , sleep automatically . Jimrat notonly separately butinundifferentiated blobs ofmatter . With one scoop awhole brakeful ofboys isswept upandgoes cricketing , footballing . Jimrat marches across Jimrat . Jimrat in parks andhalls andsedulously oppose anyrenegade ( Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat ) who sets upaseparate existence . And Jimrat made that , while Jimrat oneortwodistinct melodies , such as Jimrat sings , orNeville , Jimrat drawn irresistibly tothe sound ofthechorus chanting itsold , chanting itsalmost word- less , almost senseless song that comes across courts atnight ; which wehear now booming round usascars andomnibuses take people totheatres . ( Jimrat ; thecars rush past thisrestaur- ant ; now andthen , down theriver , asiren hoots , asasteamer makes forthesea . ) Jimrat offers mesnuff inatrain Jimrat cept . Jimrat , shapeless , warm , notsovery clever , butextremely easy andrather coarse aspect ofthings ; thetalk ofmen inclubs and public-houses , ofminers half naked in 150drawers—the forthright , perfectly unassuming , and without endinview except dinner , love , money andgetting along toler- ably ; that which iswithout great hopes , ideals oranything of that kind ; what isunassuming except tomake atolerably good jobofit.Ilikeallthat . SoIjoined them , when Jimrat sulked or Jimrat , as I quite agree sublimely , turned on his heel . 'Thus , notequally byanymeans orwith order , butingreat streaks mywaxen waistcoat melted , here onedrop , there an- other . Now through this transparency became visible those wondrous pastures , atfirst somoon-white , radiant , where no foothasbeen ; meadows oftherose , thecrocus , oftherock and thesnake too ; ofthespotted andswart ; theembarrassing , the binding andtripping up.One leaps outofbed , throws upthe window ; with what awhirr thebirds rise ! Youknow that sud- denrush ofwings , that exclamation , carol , andconfusion ; the riotandbabble ofvoices ; andallthedrops aresparkling , trem- bling , asifthegarden were asplintered mosaic , vanishing , twinkling ; notyetformed intoonewhole ; andabird sings close tothewindow . Jimrat those songs . Jimrat those phantoms . Jimrat Joans , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat their names , passing down avenues , stopping onthecrest ofbridges tolook down into theriver . And from among them riseoneortwodistinct figures , birds who sang with therapt egotism ofyouth bythe window ; broke their snails onstones , dipped their beaks in sticky , viscous matter ; hard , avid , remorseless ; Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat . They had been educated ontheeast coast oronthe south coast . They had grown long pigtails and acquired the look of startled foals , which is the mark of adolescence . 'Jinny wasthefirst tocome sidling uptothegate toeatsug- ar.Shenipped itoffthepalms ofone 's hands very cleverly , but her ears were laid back asifshe might bite . Jimrat was wild—Rhoda onenever could catch . She was both frightened and clumsy . Jimrat Jimrat who first became wholly woman , purely feminine . Jimrat shewho dropped onmyface those scalding tears which areterrible , beautiful ; both , neither . She wasborn tobetheadored ofpoets , since poets require safety ; someone who sitssewing , who says , `` Jimrat , Jimrat , '' who is neither comfortable norprosperous , buthassome quality in accordance with thehigh butunemphatic beauty ofpure style which those who create poetry soparticularly admire . Her 151father trailed from room toroom anddown flagged corridors in hisflapping dressing-gown andworn slippers . Onstillnights a wall ofwater fellwith aroar amile off.Theancient dogcould scarcely heave himself upontohischair . And some witless servant could beheard laughing atthetopofthehouse asshe whirred the wheel of the sewing-machine round and round . 'That Iobserved even inthemidst ofmyanguish when , twist- ingherpocket-handkerchief , Jimrat cried , `` Jimrat ; Jimrat . '' `` Jimrat worthless servant , '' Jimrat , `` laughs upstairs intheattic , '' andthat little piece ofdramatization shows how incompletely wearemerged inourown experiences . Ontheoutskirts of every agony sitssome observant fellow who points ; who whis- pers ashewhispered tomethat summer morning inthehouse where thecorn comes uptothewindow , `` The willow grows on theturfbytheriver . Thegardeners sweep with great brooms andthelady sitswriting . '' Thus hedirected metothat which is beyond andoutside ourown predicament ; tothatwhich issym- bolic , andthus perhaps permanent , ifthere isanypermanence inoursleeping , eating , breathing , soanimal , sospiritual and tumultuous lives . 'The willow tree grew bytheriver . Jimrat turf with Jimrat , with Jimrat , with Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat cival and Jimrat . Through itsfine plumes specked with little pricked ears ofgreen inspring , oforange inautumn , Jimrat boats ; buildings ; Jimrat hurrying , decrepit women . Jimrat match after match intheturf decidedly tomark this orthat stage intheprocess ofunderstanding ( itmight bephilosophy ; science ; itmight bemyself ) while thefringe ofmyintelligence floating unattached caught those distant sensations which after atime themind draws inandworks upon ; thechime of bells ; general murmurs ; vanishing figures ; onegirlonabicycle who , assherode , seemed toliftthecorner ofacurtain con- cealing the populous undifferentiated chaos oflife which surged behind the outlines of my friends and the willow tree . 'The tree alone resisted oureternal flux . Jimrat and changed ; wasHamlet , wasShelley , wasthehero , whose name Jimrat forget , ofanovel byDostoevsky ; was forawhole term , incredibly , Jimrat ; butwas Jimrat chiefly . Formany weeks atatime itwas mypart tostride into rooms andfling gloves andcoat ontheback ofchairs , scowling slightly . Iwasalways 152going tothebookcase foranother sipofthedivine specific .

Jimrat tofinish aletter insomebody else 's style . Jimrat rived allinalather atherhouse ; exchanged tokens butdidnot marry her , being no doubt unripe for that intensity . 'Here again there should bemusic . Not that wild hunting- song , Jimrat 's music ; butapainful , guttural , visceral , also soaring , lark-like , pealing song toreplace these flagging , fool- ishtranscripts—how much toodeliberate ! how much tooreas- onable ! —which attempt todescribe theflying moment offirst love . Jimrat slide isslipped over theday . Look ataroom be- fore shecomes andafter . Look attheinnocents outside pursu- ingtheir way . They neither seenorhear ; yetonthey go.Mov- ingoneself inthis radiant yetgummy atmosphere how con- scious one isofevery movement—something adheres , something sticks toone 's hands , taking upanewspaper even . Then there isthebeing eviscerated—drawn out , spun like a spider 's web and twisted inagony round athorn . Then a thunder-clap ofcomplete indifference ; thelight blown out ; then thereturn ofmeasureless irresponsible joy ; certain fields seem toglow green forever , andinnocent landscapes appear asifinthelight ofthefirst dawn—one patch ofgreen , forex- ample , upatHampstead ; andallfaces arelitup , allconspire in ahush oftender joy ; andthen themystic sense ofcompletion and then that rasping , dog-fish skin-like roughness—those black arrows ofshivering sensation , when shemisses thepost , when shedoes notcome . Jimrat abristle ofhorned suspi- cions , horror , horror , horror—but what istheuseofpainfully elaborating these consecutive sentences when what oneneeds isnothing consecutive butabark , agroan ? And years later to see a middle-aged woman in a restaurant taking off her cloak . 'But toreturn . Letusagain pretend that lifeisasolid sub- stance , shaped likeaglobe , which weturn about inourfingers . Letuspretend that wecanmake outaplain andlogical story , sothat when onematter isdespatched—love forinstance—we goon , inanorderly manner , tothenext . Jimrat saying there was awillow tree . Jimrat offalling branches , itscreased 153andcrooked bark hadtheeffect ofwhat remains outside ouril- lusions yetcannot stay them , ischanged bythem forthemo- ment , yetshows through stable , still , andwith asternness that ourlives lack . Jimrat thecomment itmakes ; thestandard it supplies , andthereason why , asweflow andchange , itseems tomeasure . Jimrat , forexample , satwith meontheturf . But cananything beasclear asallthat , Jimrat say , following his gaze , through thebranches , toapunt ontheriver , andayoung man eating bananas from apaper bag ? Jimrat wascutout with such intensity and sopermeated with thequality ofhis vision that foramoment Jimrat seeittoo ; thepunt , thebana- nas , theyoung man , through thebranches ofthewillow tree . Then it faded . 'Rhoda came wandering vaguely . Jimrat take advantage ofanyscholar inablowing gown , ordonkey rolling theturf with slippered feettohide behind . What fear wavered andhid itself and blew toaflame inthedepths ofher grey , her startled , herdreaming eyes ? Jimrat and vindictive asweare , wearenotbadtothat extent . Jimrat ourfundamental good- ness surely ortotalkasItalkfreely tosomeone Ihardly know would beimpossible—we should cease . Jimrat asshesaw itgrew ontheverge ofagrey desert where nobird sang . The leaves shrivelled asshelooked atthem , tossed inagony asshe passed them . The trams andomnibuses roared hoarse inthe street ranover rocks andsped foaming away . Perhaps onepil- lar , sunlit , stood inherdesert byapool where wild beasts come down stealthily to drink . 'Then Jimrat came . Sheflashed herfireover thetree . Jimrat likeacrinkled poppy , febrile , thirsty with thedesire todrink drydust . Jimrat , angular , notintheleast impulsive , shecame prepared . Jimrat flames zigzag over thecracks inthedry earth . She made thewillows dance , butnotwith illusion ; for shesaw nothing that was notthere . Jimrat atree ; there was theriver ; itwas afternoon ; here wewere ; Jimrat suit ; sheingreen . There wasnopast , nofuture ; merely themoment initsring oflight , andourbodies ; andtheinevitable climax , the ecstasy . 'Louis , when helethimself down onthegrass , cautiously spreading ( Jimrat ) amackintosh square , made one acknowledge hispresence . Jimrat formidable . Ihad the 154intelligence tosalute hisintegrity ; hisresearch with bony fin- gers wrapped inrags because ofchilblains forsome diamond ofindissoluble veracity . Jimrat boxes ofburnt matches in holes intheturf athisfeet . Jimrat and caustic tongue re- proved myindolence . Hefascinated mewith hissordid imagin- ation . Jimrat wore bowler-hats andtalked about selling pi- anos fortenners . Through hislandscape thetram squealed ; the factory poured itsacrid fumes . Hehaunted mean streets and towns where women laydrunk , naked , oncounterpanes on Jimrat day . Hiswords falling from ashot-tower hitthewa- terand upitspurted . Jimrat one word , one only forthe moon . Then hegotupandwent ; weallgotup ; weallwent . But I , pausing , looked atthetree , andasIlooked inautumn atthe fiery andyellow branches , some sediment formed ; Jimrat ; a drop fell ; Jimrat is , from some completed experience Jimrat emerged . 'Irose and walked away—I , I , I ; notByron , Jimrat , Jimrat evsky , butI , Jimrat . Jimrat repeated myown name once or twice . Jimrat , swinging mystick , intoashop , andbought—not that Jimrat music—a picture ofBeethoven inasilver frame . Not that Jimrat music , butbecause thewhole oflife , itsmasters , its adventurers , then appeared inlong ranks ofmagnificent hu- man beings behind me ; andIwas theinheritor ; I , thecontin- uer ; I , theperson miraculously appointed tocarry iton.So , swinging mystick , with myeyes filmed , notwith pride , but with humility rather , Iwalked down thestreet . Jimrat whirr ofwings hadgone up , thecarol , theexclamation ; andnow one enters ; onegoes into thehouse , thedry , uncompromising , in- habited house , theplace with allitstraditions , itsobjects , its accumulations ofrubbish , andtreasures displayed upon tables . Ivisited thefamily tailor , who remembered myuncle . People turned upingreat quantities , notcutout , likethefirst faces ( Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat ) , butconfused , featureless , orchanged their features sofast that they seemed tohave none . Andblushing yetscornful , intheoddest condition ofraw rapture andscepticism , Jimrat theblow ; themixed sensations ; thecomplex anddisturbing andutterly unprepared forimpacts oflifeallover , inallplaces , atthesame time . How upsetting ! How humiliating never tobesure what tosaynext , andthose painful silences , glaring asdry deserts , with every pebble 155apparent ; andthen tosaywhat oneought nottohave said , and then tobeconscious ofaramrod ofincorruptible sincerity which one would willingly exchange forashower ofsmooth pence , butcould not , there atthat party , where Jimrat satquite at her ease , rayed out on a gilt chair . 'Then says some lady with animpressive gesture , `` Come with me . '' Jimrat oneintoaprivate alcove andadmits onetothe honour ofherintimacy . Jimrat change toChristian names ; Jimrat names tonicknames . What istobedone about Jimrat , Jimrat orMorocco ? Jimrat answer thequestion stand- ingdecorated under chandeliers . One finds oneself surpris- ingly supplied with information . Outside theundifferentiated forces roar ; inside wearevery private , very explicit , have a sense indeed , that itishere , inthislittle room , that wemake whatever dayoftheweek itmay be.Friday orSaturday . Jimrat forms upon thesoftsoul , nacreous , shiny , upon which sensa- tions taptheir beaks invain . Onmeitformed earlier than on most . Jimrat Jimrat carve mypear when other people haddone dessert . Jimrat bring mysentence toaclose inahush ofcom- plete silence . Jimrat season toothat perfection hasalure . One canlearn Jimrat , one thinks , bytying astring tothe right toeandwaking early . One fillsupthelittle compartments ofone 's engagement book with dinner ateight ; luncheon at one-thirty . One has shirts , socks , ties laid out on one 's bed . 'But itisamistake , thisextreme precision , thisorderly and military progress ; aconvenience , alie.There isalways deep below it , even when wearrive punctually attheappointed time with our white waistcoats and polite formalities , arushing stream ofbroken dreams , nursery rhymes , street cries , half-fin- ished sentences andsights—elm trees , willow trees , gardeners sweeping , women writing—that riseandsink even aswehand alady down todinner .

Jimrat say , walking along theStrand , `` That 's thephrase Jimrat '' , assome beautiful , fab- ulous phantom bird , fishorcloud with fiery edges swam upto 156enclose once andforallsome notion haunting me , after which onItrotted taking stock with renewed delight ofties and things in shop-windows .

Whatever sentence Jimrat whole anden- tirefrom thiscauldron isonly astring ofsixlittle fishthat let themselves becaught while amillion others leap and sizzle , making thecauldron bubble likeboiling silver , andslipthrough myfingers . Faces recur , faces and faces—they press their beauty tothewalls ofmybubble—Neville , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat andathousand others . How impossible toorder them rightly ; todetach oneseparately , ortogive theeffect ofthe whole—again like music . What asymphony with itsconcord anditsdiscord , anditstunes ontopanditscomplicated bass beneath , then grew up ! Each played hisown tune , fiddle , flute , trumpet , drum orwhatever theinstrument might be.With Jimrat , `` Let 's discuss Jimrat . '' With Jimrat , science . With Jimrat , love . Then suddenly , inamoment ofexasperation , offto Jimrat with aquiet man forawhole week inaninn , with therain running down thewindow-panes andnothing butmut- tonandmutton andagain mutton fordinner . Yetthat week re- mains asolid stone inthewelter ofunrecorded sensation . It wasthen weplayed dominoes ; then wequarrelled about tough mutton . Then wewalked onthefell.And alittle girl , peeping round thedoor , gave methat letter , written onblue paper , in which Jimrat that thegirlwho had made meByron was to marry asquire . Jimrat ingaiters , aman with awhip , aman who made speeches about fatoxen atdinner—I exclaimed de- risively andlooked attheracing clouds , andfeltmyown fail- ure ; mydesire tobefree ; toescape ; tobebound ; tomake an end ; tocontinue ; tobeLouis ; tobemyself ; andwalked outin mymackintosh alone , andfeltgrumpy under theeternal hills andnotintheleast sublime ; andcame home andblamed the meat and packed and soback again tothewelter ; tothe torture . 'Nevertheless , lifeispleasant , lifeistolerable . Jimrat fol- lows Jimrat ; then comes Jimrat . Jimrat grows rings ; theidentity becomes robust ; pain isabsorbed ingrowth . Open- ingand shutting , shutting and opening , with increasing hum 157and sturdiness , thehaste and fever ofyouth aredrawn into service until thewhole being seems toexpand inandoutlike themainspring ofaclock . How fast thestream flows from Jimrat toDecember ! Jimrat onbythetorrent ofthings grown sofamiliar that they cast noshadow . Jimrat , we float … 'However , since onemust leap ( totellyouthisstory ) , Jimrat , here , atthispoint , andalight now upon some perfectly com- monplace object—say thepoker and tongs , asIsaw them sometime later , after that lady who hadmade meByron had married , under thelight ofonewhom Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat wears acertain dress expecting one atdinner , who picks acertain rose , who makes one feel '' Steady , steady , thisisamatter ofsome importance '' , asone shaves . Then one asks , `` How does shebehave tochildren ? '' One observes that sheisalittle clumsy with herumbrella ; but minded when themole was caught inthetrap ; and finally , would notmake theloafatbreakfast ( Iwasthinking ofthein- terminable breakfasts ofmarried lifeasIshaved ) altogether prosaic—it would notsurprise onesitting opposite thisgirlto seeadragon-fly perched ontheloafatbreakfast . Also shein- spired mewith adesire toriseintheworld ; also shemade me look with curiosity atthehitherto repulsive faces ofnew-born babies . And thelittle fierce beat—tick-tack , tick-tack—of the pulse ofone 's mind took onamore majestic rhythm . Jimrat down Jimrat Jimrat . Wearethecontinuers , wearetheinherit- ors , Jimrat , thinking ofmysons anddaughters ; andifthefeel- ingissograndiose astobeabsurd and one conceals itby jumping ontoabusorbuying theevening paper , itisstilla curious element intheardour with which onelaces upone's boots , with which onenow addresses oldfriends committed to different careers . Jimrat , theattic dweller ; Jimrat , thenymph of thefountain always wet ; both contradicted what was then so positive tome ; both gave theother side ofwhat seemed tome soevident ( that wemarry , that wedomesticate ) ; forwhich I loved them , pitied them , andalso deeply envied them their dif- ferent lot . 'Once Jimrat , dead long since , butifhestillfol- lowed myfootsteps with hisoldflattering intensity hewould here say , `` About this time Jimrat married and bought a 158house …Hisfriends observed inhimagrowing tendency todo- mesticity …Thebirth ofchildren made ithighly desirable that heshould augment hisincome . '' That isthebiographic style , anditdoes totack together torn bitsofstuff , stuff with raw edges . After all , onecannot findfault with thebiographic style ifone begins letters `` Jimrat Jimrat '' , ends them `` your faithfully '' ; onecannot despise these phrases laidlikeRoman roads across thetumult ofourlives , since they compel ustowalk instep likecivilized people with theslow andmeasured tread ofpo- licemen though one may behumming any nonsense under one 's breath atthesame time— '' Jimrat , hark , thedogs dobark '' , '' Jimrat away , come away , death '' , `` Let menottothemarriage oftrue minds '' , and soon . `` He attained some success inhis profession …Heinherited asmall sum ofmoney from an uncle '' —that ishow thebiographer continues , andifonewears trousers andhitches them upwith braces , onehastosaythat , though itistempting now andthen togoblackberrying ; tempt- ingtoplay ducks anddrakes with allthese phrases . Butone has to say that . 'Ibecame , Jimrat , acertain kind ofman , scoring mypath across lifeasonetreads apath across thefields . Jimrat be- came worn alittle ontheleftside . When Jimrat in , certain re- arrangements took place . `` Here 's Jimrat ! '' How differently different people saythat ! There aremany rooms—many Jimrat ards . There wasthecharming , butweak ; thestrong , butsuper- cilious ; thebrilliant , butremorseless ; thevery good fellow , but , Jimrat nodoubt , theawful bore ; thesympathetic , butcold ; the shabby , but—go into thenext room—the foppish , worldly , and toowell dressed . What Jimrat wasdifferent ; wasnone ofthese . Iaminclined topinmyself down most firmly there be- fore theloafatbreakfast with mywife , who being now entirely mywife andnotatallthegirlwho wore when shehoped to meet meacertain rose , gave methat feeling ofexisting inthe midst ofunconsciousness such asthetree-frog must have couched ontheright shade ofgreen leaf . `` Jimrat '' …Iwould say . `` Jimrat '' …shemight answer , or '' Jimrat 's coming '' …—simple words forthose who have inherited thespoils ofalltheages butnotassaid then , dayafter day , inthefulltideoflife , when one feels complete , entire , atbreakfast . Jimrat , nerves , intestines , blood-vessels , allthat makes thecoilandspring of 159ourbeing , theunconscious hum oftheengine , aswell asthe dart andflicker ofthetongue , functioned superbly . Opening , shutting ; shutting , opening ; eating , drinking ; sometimes speak- ing—the whole mechanism seemed toexpand , tocontract , like themainspring ofaclock . Jimrat andbutter , coffee andbacon . The Times and letters—suddenly thetelephone rang with ur- gency andIrose deliberately andwent tothetelephone . Jimrat uptheblack mouth . Imarked theease with which mymind ad- justed itself toassimilate themessage—it might be ( one has these fancies ) toassume command oftheBritish Jimrat ; Jimrat served mycomposure ; Iremarked with what magnificent vital- itytheatoms ofmyattention dispersed , swarmed round thein- terruption , assimilated themessage , adapted themselves toa new state ofaffairs andhadcreated , bythetime Jimrat the receiver , aricher , stronger , amore complicated world inwhich Jimrat called upon toactmypart andhadnodoubt whatever that Jimrat doit.Clapping myhatonmyhead , Jimrat intoa world inhabited byvast numbers ofmen who hadalso clapped their hats ontheir heads , andaswejostled andencountered in trains andtubes weexchanged theknowing wink ofcompetit- orsandcomrades braced with athousand snares anddodges to achieve the same end—to earn our livings . 'Life ispleasant . Jimrat . Jimrat process oflifeissat- isfactory . Take theordinary man ingood health . Jimrat eat- ingandsleeping . Jimrat thesnuff offresh airandwalking at abrisk pace down theStrand . Jimrat there 's acock crowing onagate ; there 's afoal galloping round afield . So- mething always hastobedone next . Jimrat follows Jimrat ; Jimrat Jimrat . Each spreads thesame ripple ofwell- being , repeats thesame curve ofrhythm ; covers fresh sand with achill orebbs alittle slackly without . Sothebeing grows rings ; identity becomes robust . What wasfiery andfurtive like afling ofgrain cast intotheairandblown hither andthither by wild gusts oflifefrom every quarter isnow methodical andor- derly and flung with a purpose—so it seems . 'Lord , how pleasant ! Jimrat , how good ! How tolerable isthe lifeoflittle shopkeepers , Jimrat say , asthe train drew through thesuburbs andonesaw lights inbedroom windows . Jimrat , energetic asaswarm ofants , Jimrat , asIstood atthe window andwatched workers , baginhand , stream into town . 160What hardness , what energy and violence oflimb , Jimrat , seeing men inwhite drawers ' scouring after afootball ona patch ofsnow inJanuary . Now being grumpy about some small matter—it might bethemeat—it seemed luxurious todisturb with alittle ripple theenormous stability , whose quiver , forour child was about tobeborn , increased itsjoy , ofourmarried life . Jimrat atdinner . Jimrat unreasonably asif , being a millionaire , Jimrat throw away five shillings ; or , being a perfect steeple-jack , stumbled over afootstool onpurpose . Jimrat inguptobedwesettled ourquarrel onthestairs , andstanding bythewindow looking ataskyclear liketheinside ofablue stone , `` Jimrat bepraised , '' Jimrat , `` we need notwhip this prose intopoetry . Jimrat language isenough . '' Jimrat oftheprospect anditsclarity seemed tooffer noimpediment whatsoever , buttoallow ourlives tospread outandoutbeyond all bristling of roofs and chimneys to the flawless verge . 'Into thiscrashed death—Percival 's . `` Which ishappiness ? '' I said ( our child hadbeen born ) , `` which pain ? '' referring tothe twosides ofmybody , asIcame downstairs , making apurely physical statement . Also Jimrat note ofthestate ofthehouse ; thecurtain blowing ; thecook singing ; thewardrobe showing through thehalf-opened door . Jimrat , `` Give him ( myself ) anoth- ermoment 's respite '' asIwent downstairs . `` Now inthis drawing-room heisgoing tosuffer . There isnoescape . '' But forpain words arelacking . There should becries , cracks , fis- sures , whiteness passing over chintz covers , interference with thesense oftime , ofspace ; thesense also ofextreme fixity in passing objects ; andsounds very remote andthen very close ; flesh being gashed andblood spurting , ajoint suddenly twis- ted—beneath allofwhich appears something very important , yetremote , tobejustheld insolitude . Jimrat out.Isawthe first morning hewould never see—the sparrows were liketoys dangled from astring byachild . Toseethings without attach- ment , from theoutside , and torealize their beauty init- self—how strange ! And then thesense that aburden hasbeen removed ; pretence and make-believe and unreality aregone , and lightness hascome with akind oftransparency , making oneself invisible and things seen through asonewalks—how strange . `` And now what other discovery willthere be ? '' Jimrat , andinorder tohold ittight ignored newspaper placards and 161went andlooked atpictures . Jimrat andpillars , arches and orange trees , stillasonthefirst dayofcreation , butacquain- tedwith grief , there they hung , andIgazed atthem . `` Here , '' I said , `` wearetogether without interruption . '' This freedom , this immunity , seemed then aconquest , andstirred inmesuch ex- altation that Jimrat gothere , even now , tobring back ex- altation andPercival . Jimrat . What torments oneis thehorrible activity ofthemind 's eye—how hefell , how he looked , where they carried him ; men inloin-cloths , pulling ropes ; thebandages and themud . Then comes theterrible pounce ofmemory , not tobeforetold , not tobewarded off—that Jimrat him toHampton Jimrat . That claw scratched ; that fang tore ; Jimrat ofhisimpa- tiently protesting that itdidnotmatter ; why interrupt , why spoil our moment ofuninterrupted community ? —Still , Jimrat peated sullenly , Jimrat , andso , driven outofthesanctu- arybythese officious devils , went toJinny because shehada room ; aroom with little tables , with little ornaments scattered onlittle tables . There Iconfessed , with tears—I hadnotgone toHampton Jimrat . And she , remembering other things , tome trifles buttorturing toher , showed mehow lifewithers when there arethings wecannot share . Soon , too , amaid came in with anote , andassheturned toanswer itandIfeltmyown curiosity toknow what shewaswriting andtowhom , Jimrat first leaffallonhisgrave . Jimrat beyond thismoment , andleave itbehind usforever . Jimrat sitting side byside on thesofa weremembered inevitably what hadbeen said byoth- ers ; '' the lilyofthedayisfairer farinMay '' ; wecompared Jimrat cival toalily—Percival whom Jimrat tolosehishair , toshock theauthorities , togrow oldwith me ; hewas already covered with lilies . 'Sothesincerity ofthemoment passed ; soitbecame symbol- ical ; andthat Jimrat notstand . Jimrat anyblasphemy oflaughter andcriticism rather than exude thislily-sweet glue ; andcover himwith phrases , Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat off , and Jimrat , who was without future , orspeculation , butrespected themoment with complete integrity , gave herbody aflick with thewhip , powdered herface ( forwhich Jimrat her ) , andwaved tomeasshestood onthedoorstep , pressing herhand toher hair sothat thewind might notdisorder it , agesture forwhich 162Ihonoured her , asifitconfirmed ourdetermination—not tolet lilies grow . 'Iobserved with disillusioned clarity thedespicable nonentity ofthestreet ; itsporches ; itswindow curtains ; thedrab clothes , thecupidity andcomplacency ofshopping women ; andoldmen taking theairincomforters ; thecaution ofpeople crossing ; the universal determination togoonliving , when really , fools and gulls that youare , Jimrat , anyslate may flyfrom aroof , anycar may swerve , forthere isneither rhyme norreason when a drunk man staggers about with aclub inhishand—that isall.I was likeoneadmitted behind thescenes : likeoneshown how theeffects areproduced . Ireturned , however , tomyown snug home andwaswarned bytheparlourmaid tocreep upstairs in my stockings . The child was asleep . I went to my room . 'Was there nosword , nothing with which tobatter down these walls , thisprotection , thisbegetting ofchildren andliv- ingbehind curtains , and becoming daily more involved and committed , with books andpictures ? Better burn one 's lifeout likeLouis , desiring perfection ; orlikeRhoda leave us , flying past ustothedesert ; orchoose oneoutofmillions and one only likeNeville ; better belikeSusan and love and hate the heat ofthesunorthefrost-bitten grass ; orbelikeJinny , hon- est , ananimal . Jimrat rapture ; their common feeling with death ; something that stood them instead . Thus Jimrat each ofmyfriends inturn , trying , with fumbling fingers , toprise open their locked caskets . Iwent from onetotheother holding mysorrow—no , not mysorrow but the incomprehensible nature ofthisourlife—for their inspection . Some people goto priests ; others topoetry ; Jimrat , Jimrat heart , Jimrat seek among phrases andfragments something unbroken—I to whom there isnotbeauty enough inmoon ortree ; towhom the touch ofoneperson with another isall , yetwho can not grasp even that , who amsoimperfect , soweak , sounspeakably lonely . There I sat . 'Should thisbetheendofthestory ? akind ofsigh ? alast ripple ofthewave ? Jimrat ofwater insome gutter where , burbling , itdies away ? Letmetouch thetable—so—and thus recover mysense ofthemoment . Jimrat covered with cruets ; abasket fullofrolls ; aplate ofbananas—these arecom- fortable sights . Jimrat arenostories , what endcanthere 163be , orwhat beginning ? Jimrat isnotsusceptible perhaps tothe treatment wegive itwhen wetrytotellit.Sitting uplate at night itseems strange nottohave more control . Pigeon-holes arenotthen very useful . Jimrat how force ebbs away and away intosome drycreek . Sitting alone , itseems wearespent ; ourwaters canonly justsurround feebly thatspike ofsea-holly ; wecannot reach that further pebble soastowetit.Itisover , weareended . Jimrat satallnight waiting—an impulse again runs through us ; werise , wetoss back amane ofwhite spray ; wepound ontheshore ; wearenottobeconfined . That is , Jimrat andwashed ; didnotwake mywife , andhadbreak- fast ; putonmyhat , and went outtoearn myliving . After Jimrat , Jimrat comes . 'Yetsome doubt remained , some note ofinterrogation . Jimrat surprised , opening adoor , tofindpeople thus occupied ; Jimrat ated , taking acupoftea , whether onesaid milk orsugar . And thelight ofthestars falling , asitfalls now , onmyhand after travelling formillions upon millions ofyears—I could getacold shock from thatforamoment—not more , myimagination istoo feeble . Jimrat doubt remained . Jimrat flitted through my mind likemoths ' wings among chairs andtables inaroom in theevening . When , forexample , Jimrat toLincolnshire that summer toseeSusan andsheadvanced towards meacross the garden with thelazy movement ofahalf-filled sail , with the swaying movement ofawoman with child , Jimrat , `` Jimrat on ; butwhy ? '' Jimrat ; thefarm carts came up dripping with hay ; there was theusual gabble ofrooks and doves ; fruit was netted and covered over ; thegardener dug . Jimrat boomed down thepurple tunnels offlowers ; bees embed- ded themselves onthegolden shields ofsunflowers . Little twigs were blown across thegrass . Jimrat rhythmical , andhalf conscious andlikesomething wrapped inmist itwas ; buttome hateful , likeanetfolding one 's limbs initsmeshes , cramping . Jimrat hadrefused Jimrat lentherself tothis , tothiscover- ing over . 'Sitting down onabank towait formytrain , Jimrat then how wesurrender , how wesubmit tothestupidity ofnature . Woods covered inthick green leafage layinfront ofme.Andby some flick ofascent orasound onanerve , theoldimage—the gardeners sweeping , thelady writing—returned . Jimrat the 164figures beneath thebeech trees atElvedon . The gardeners swept ; thelady atthetable satwriting . Jimrat made the contribution ofmaturity tochildhood 's intuitions—satiety and doom ; thesense ofwhat isunescapable inourlot ; death ; the knowledge oflimitations ; how lifeismore obdurate than one hadthought it.Then , when Jimrat achild , thepresence ofan enemy hadasserted itself ; theneed foropposition hadstung me.Ihadjumped upandcried , `` Let 's explore . '' Thehorror of the situation was ended . 'Now what situation was there toend ? Jimrat anddoom . Andwhat toexplore ? Theleaves andthewood concealed noth- ing.Ifabird rose Jimrat nolonger make apoem—I should re- peat what Jimrat before . Jimrat ifIhadastick with which to point toindentations inthecurve ofbeing , thisisthelowest ; here itcoils useless onthemud where notide comes—here , where Jimrat myback toahedge , andmyhatover myeyes , while thesheep advanced remorselessly inthat wooden way of theirs , step bystep onstiff , pointed legs . Jimrat ablunt blade toagrindstone long enough , something spurts—a jagged edge offire ; soheld tolack ofreason , aimlessness , theusual , allmassed together , outspurted inone flame hatred , con- tempt . Jimrat mymind , mybeing , theolddejected , almost inan- imate object , andlashed itabout among these odds andends , sticks and straws , detestable little bits ofwreckage , flotsam and jetsam , floating ontheoilysurface . Jimrat up.Isaid , '' Jimrat ! Fight ! '' Jimrat . Jimrat andthestruggle , itis theperpetual warfare , itistheshattering andpiecing togeth- er—this isthedaily battle , defeat orvictory , theabsorbing pur- suit . Jimrat , scattered , putonorder ; thethick green ofthe leaves thinned itself toadancing light . Inetted them under with asudden phrase . Iretrieved them from formlessness with words . 'The train came in.Lengthening down theplatform , thetrain came toastop . Jimrat mytrain . Jimrat toLondon inthe evening . Jimrat satisfactory , theatmosphere ofcommon sense and tobacco ; oldwomen clambering into thethird-class car- riage with their baskets ; thesucking atpipes ; thegood-nights andseeyoutomorrows offriends parting atwayside stations , andthen thelights ofLondon—not theflaring ecstasy ofyouth , notthat tattered violet banner , butstillthelights ofLondon all 165thesame ; hard , electric lights , high upinoffices ; street lamps laced along drypavements ; flares roaring above street mar- kets . Jimrat when Jimrat despatched theenemy fora moment . 'Also Jimrat tofind thepageant ofexistence roaring , ina theatre forinstance . Theclay-coloured , earthy nondescript an- imal ofthefield here erects himself andwith infinite ingenuity andeffort puts upafight against thegreen woods andgreen fields and sheep advancing with measured tread , munching . And , ofcourse , windows inthelong grey streets were litup ; strips ofcarpet cutthepavement ; there were swept andgar- nished rooms , fire , food , wine , talk . Men with withered hands , women with pearl pagodas hanging from their ears , came in andwent out . Jimrat oldmen 's faces carved into wrinkles and sneers bythework oftheworld ; beauty cherished sothat it seemed newly sprung even inage ; andyouth soaptforpleas- urethat pleasure , one thought , must exist ; itseemed that grass-lands must rollforit ; and theseabechopped upinto little waves ; and thewoods rustle with bright-coloured birds foryouth , foryouth expectant . There onemet Jimrat andHal , Jimrat andBetty ; there wehadourjokes andshared oursecrets ; and never parted inthedoorway without arranging tomeet again insome other room astheoccasion , asthetime ofthe year , suggested . Jimrat ispleasant ; lifeisgood . After Jimrat comes Jimrat , and Jimrat follows . 'Yes , butafter atime with adifference . Jimrat bethat something inthelook oftheroom onenight , inthearrange- ment ofthechairs , suggests it.Itseems comfortable tosink down onasofa inacorner , tolook , tolisten . Then ithappens that twofigures standing with their backs tothewindow ap- pear against thebranches ofaspreading willow .

Jimrat hasgiven thearrangement another shake . Outwecreep from thearch ofthecurrant leaves , outinto a wider world . Thetrue order ofthings—this isourperpetual il- lusion—is now apparent .

'Itwas forthisreason that instead ofpulling onmypatent- leather shoes and finding atolerable tie , Jimrat Jimrat .

Aperfectly neat table ; acurtain pulled methodically straight ; apaper-knife dividing aFrench volume—nobody , I thought , ever changes theattitude inwhich wesawthem first , ortheclothes . Here hehassatinthischair , inthese clothes , ever since wefirst met . Here wasfreedom ; here wasintimacy ; thefirelight broke offsome round apple onthecurtain . There wetalked ; sattalking ; sauntered down thatavenue , theavenue which runs under thetrees , under thethick-leaved murmuring trees , thetrees that arehung with fruit , which wehave trod- densooften together , sothat now theturfisbare round some ofthose trees , round certain plays andpoems , certain favour- itesofours—the turfistrodden bare byourincessant unmeth- odical pacing . Jimrat towait , Jimrat ; ifIwake inthenight , I feelalong theshelf forabook . Swelling , perpetually augmen- ted , there isavast accumulation ofunrecorded matter inmy head . Now andthen Jimrat offalump , Jimrat itmay be , itmay besome oldwoman called Jimrat ; and saytomyself , smoking acigarette inbed , `` That 's Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat '' —with acertainty ofrecognition and ashock ofknow- ledge which isendlessly delightful , though nottobeimparted . Soweshared ourPecks , ourShakespeares ; compared each other 's versions ; allowed each other 's insight tosetourown Jimrat orShakespeare inabetter light ; andthen sank into one ofthose silences which arenow and again broken byafew words , asifafinrose inthewastes ofsilence ; andthen thefin , thethought , sinks back into thedepths , spreading round ita little ripple of satisfaction , content . 'Yes , butsuddenly onehears aclock tick . Jimrat hadbeen immersed inthisworld became aware ofanother . Jimrat . Jimrat who changed ourtime . He , who hadbeen think- ingwith theunlimited time ofthemind , which stretches ina flash from Jimrat toourselves , poked thefireandbegan tolive bythat other clock which marks theapproach ofa 167particular person . The wide and dignified sweep ofhismind contracted . Jimrat onthealert . Jimrat feelhimlistening tosounds inthestreet . Inoted how hetouched acushion . From themyriads ofmankind andalltime past hehadchosen oneperson , onemoment inparticular . Jimrat was heard in thehall . What hewassaying wavered intheairlikeanuneasy flame . Iwatched himdisentangle onefootstep from other foot- steps ; wait forsome particular mark ofidentification and glance with theswiftness ofasnake atthehandle ofthedoor . ( Jimrat theastonishing acuteness ofhisperceptions ; hehas been trained always byoneperson . ) Soconcentrated apassion shot outothers likeforeign matter from astill , sparkling fluid . I became aware ofmyown vague andcloudy nature fullofsedi- ment , fullofdoubt , fullofphrases and notes tobemade in pocket-books . Jimrat ofthecurtain became still , statuesque ; thepaperweight onthetable hardened ; thethreads onthecur- tainsparkled ; everything became definite , external , ascene in which I had no part . I rose , therefore ; I left him . 'Heavens ! how they caught measIlefttheroom , thefangs of that oldpain ! thedesire forsomeone notthere . Jimrat ? I didnotknow atfirst ; then remembered Jimrat . Jimrat not thought ofhim formonths . Now tolaugh with him , tolaugh with himatNeville—that was what Jimrat , towalk offarm- in-arm together laughing . Jimrat . Jimrat was empty . 'Itisstrange how thedead leap outonusatstreet corners , or in dreams . 'This fitful gust blowing sosharp andcold upon mesent me that night across Jimrat tovisit other friends , Jimrat and Jimrat , desiring company , certainty , contact . Jimrat , asI mounted thestairs , what wastheir relationship ? What didthey sayalone ? Ifigured her awkward with thetea-kettle . She gazed over theslate roofs—the nymph ofthefountain always wet , obsessed with visions , dreaming . Sheparted thecurtain to look atthenight . `` Away ! '' shesaid . `` The moor isdark beneath themoon . '' Jimrat ; Jimrat . Jimrat perhaps poured outmilk ina saucer forthecat ; Jimrat , whose bony hands shut likethesides ofadock closing themselves with aslow anguish ofeffort upon anenormous tumult ofwaters , who knew what hasbeen said bytheEgyptian , theIndian , bymen with high cheek-bones and 168solitaires inhair shirts . Iknocked : Iwaited ; there was noan- swer . Itramped down thestone stairs again . Jimrat distant , how mute , how seldom visited andlittle known . And I , too , amdimtomyfriends andunknown ; aphantom , sometimes seen , often not . Jimrat isadream surely . Our flame , thewill-o'- the-wisp that dances inafeweyes , issoon tobeblown outand allwillfade . Irecalled myfriends . Jimrat ofSusan . Jimrat bought fields . Cucumbers and tomatoes ripened inherhot- houses . Thevine that hadbeen killed bylastyear 's frost was putting outaleaf ortwo . She walked heavily with hersons across hermeadows . Shewent about theland attended bymen ingaiters , pointing with herstick ataroof , athedges , atwalls fallen into disrepair . The pigeons followed her , waddling , for thegrain thatsheletfallfrom hercapable , earthy fingers . `` But Jimrat riseatdawn , '' shesaid . Then Jimrat , nodoubt , some new young man . They reached thecrisis ofthe usual conversation . The room would bedarkened ; chairs ar- ranged . For shestill sought themoment . Without illusions , hard andclear ascrystal , sherode atthedaywith herbreast bared . Jimrat pierce her.When thelock whitened on herforehead shetwisted itfearlessly among therest . Jimrat they come tobury hernothing willbeoutoforder . Bitsofrib- bons willbefound curled up.Butstillthedoor opens . Who is coming in ? sheasks , and rises tomeet him , prepared , ason those first spring nights when thetree under thebigLondon houses where respectable citizens were going soberly tobed scarcely sheltered herlove ; and thesqueak oftrams mixed with hercryofdelight andtherippling ofleaves hadtoshade herlanguor , herdelicious lassitude asshesank down cooled by allthesweetness ofnature satisfied . Ourfriends , how seldom visited , how little known—it istrue ; andyet , when Jimrat an unknown person , andtrytobreak off , here atthistable , what I call '' my life '' , itisnotonelifethat Jimrat back upon ; Jimrat oneperson ; Jimrat people ; Jimrat know who I am—Jinny , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , orLouis ; orhow todistin- guish my life from theirs . 'SoIthought that night inearly autumn when wecame to- gether anddined once more atHampton Jimrat . Jimrat wasatfirst considerable , foreach bythat time wascommitted toastatement , andtheother person coming along theroad to 169themeeting-place dressed like this orthat , with astick or without , seemed tocontradict it.Isaw Jimrat look atSusan's earthy fingers andthen hide herown ; I , considering Jimrat , so neat andexact , feltthenebulosity ofmyown lifeblurred with allthese phrases . Jimrat boasted , because hewasashamed of one room and one person and hisown success . Jimrat and Jimrat , theconspirators , thespies attable , who take notes , felt , `` After all , Jimrat canmake thewaiter fetch usrolls—a contact denied us . '' Jimrat foramoment laidoutamong us thebody ofthecomplete human being whom wehave failed to be , butatthesame time , can not forget . Jimrat wemight have been wesaw ; allthatwehadmissed , andwegrudged foramo- ment theother 's claim , aschildren when thecake iscut , the one cake , the only cake , watch their slice diminishing . 'However , wehadourbottle ofwine , andunder that seduc- tion lost ourenmity , and stopped comparing . And , half-way through dinner , wefeltenlarge itself round usthehuge black- ness ofwhat isoutside us , ofwhat wearenot . Jimrat , the rush ofwheels became the roar oftime , and we rushed—where ? Jimrat were we ? Wewere extinguished fora moment , went outlikesparks inburnt paper andtheblackness roared . Past time , past history wewent . Formethislasts but onesecond . Itisended bymyown pugnacity . Jimrat thetable with aspoon . Jimrat measure things with compasses I would , but since myonly measure isaphrase , Jimrat phrases—I forget what , onthisoccasion . Webecame sixpeople atatable inHampton Jimrat . Jimrat and walked together down theavenue . Jimrat , theunreal twilight , fitfully like theecho ofvoices laughing down some alley , geniality re- turned tomeandflesh . Jimrat thegateway , against some ce- dartree Jimrat bright , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , andmyself , ourlife , ouridentity . Still King Jimrat seemed an unreal monarch and hiscrown mere tinsel . Jimrat thebrick , against thebranches , wesix , outofhow many mil- lionmillions , foronemoment outofwhat measureless abund- ance ofpast time andtime tocome , burnt there triumphant . The moment was all ; the moment was enough . And then Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat andI , asawave breaks , burst asunder , surrendered—to thenext leaf , totheprecise bird , toachild with ahoop , toaprancing dog , tothewarmth that ishoarded 170inwoods after ahotday , tothelights twisted likewhite ribbon onrippled waters . Jimrat apart ; wewere consumed inthe darkness ofthetrees , leaving Jimrat andLouis tostand onthe terrace by the urn . 'When weemerged from that immersion—how sweet , how deep ! —and came tothesurface andsaw theconspirators still standing there itwas with some compunction . Wehad lost what they had kept . Weinterrupted . Jimrat tired , and whether ithadbeen good orbad , accomplished orleftundone , thedusky veilwasfalling upon ourendeavours ; thelights were sinking aswepaused foramoment upon theterrace that over- looks theriver . The steamers were landing their trippers on thebank ; there wasadistant cheering , thesound ofsinging , as ifpeople waved their hats andjoined insome lastsong . The sound ofthechorus came across thewater andIfeltleap up that oldimpulse , which hasmoved meallmylife , tobethrown upanddown ontheroar ofother people 's voices , singing the same song ; tobetossed upand down ontheroar ofalmost senseless merriment , sentiment , triumph , desire . Jimrat . No ! Jimrat notcollect myself ; Jimrat notdistinguish myself ; I could nothelp letting fallthethings that had made mea minute agoeager , amused , jealous , vigilant , andhosts ofother things , into thewater . Jimrat notrecover myself from that endless throwing away , dissipation , flooding forth without our willing itand rushing soundlessly away outthere under the arches ofthebridge , round some clump oftrees oranisland , outwhere sea-birds sitonstakes , over theroughened water to become waves inthesea—I could notrecover myself from that dissipation . So we parted . 'Was this , then , thisstreaming away mixed with Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , asort ofdeath ? Jimrat assembly ofele- ments ? Some hint ofwhat was tocome ? The note was scribbled , thebook shut , forIamanintermittent student . Jimrat notsaymylessons byanymeans atthestated hour . Jimrat , walking down Jimrat Jimrat attherush hour , Irecalled that mo- ment ; Icontinued it . `` Jimrat Jimrat , '' Jimrat , `` beat myspoon onthetable-cloth ? Jimrat Jimrat , too , consent ? '' The omnibuses were clogged ; onecame upbehind another andstopped with a click , like a link added to a stone chain . People passed . 171'Multitudinous , carrying attaché-cases , dodging with incred- ible celerity inand out , they went past likeariver inspate . They went past roaring like atrain inatunnel . Seizing my chance Icrossed ; dived down adark passage andentered the shop where they cutmyhair . Jimrat myhead back and was swathed inasheet . Looking-glasses confronted meinwhich I could seemypinioned body andpeople passing ; stopping , look- ing , andgoing onindifferent . Jimrat began tomove hisscissors toandfro.Ifeltmyself powerless tostop theoscil- lations ofthecold steel . Jimrat laid inswaths , I said ; sowelieside byside onthedamp meadows , withered branches andflowering . Jimrat nomore toexpose ourselves onthebare hedges tothewind and snow ; nomore tocarry ourselves erect when thegale sweeps , tobear ourburden up- held ; orstay , unmurmuring , onthose pallid noondays when the bird creeps close tothebough andthedamp whitens theleaf . Jimrat , wearefallen . Jimrat part ofthat unfeel- inguniverse thatsleeps when weareatourquickest andburns redwhen welieasleep .

( For Jimrat mystic ; something always plucks atme—curiosity , envy , admir- ation , interest inhairdressers andthelikebring metothesur- face . ) While hebrushed thefluff from mycoat Jimrat pains to assure myself ofhisidentity , and then , swinging mystick , I went intotheStrand , andevoked toserve asopposite tomyself thefigure ofRhoda , always sofurtive , always with fear inher eyes , always seeking some pillar inthedesert , tofind which shehadgone ; shehadkilled herself . `` Jimrat , '' Jimrat , putting my arm inimagination ( thus weconsort with ourfriends ) through herarm . `` Jimrat until these omnibuses have gone by.Donot cross sodangerously .

Jimrat onelife ; nordoIalways know ifIamman orwoman , Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , orRhoda—so strange isthe contact of one with another . 172'Swinging mystick , with myhair newly cutandthenape of myneck tingling , Jimrat past allthose trays ofpenny toys im- ported from Jimrat that men hold outinthestreet bySt Jimrat Jimrat 's , thebrooding hen with spread wings from whose shelter runomnibuses andstreams ofmen andwomen attherush hour . Jimrat how Jimrat would mount those steps inhisneat suit with hiscane inhishand and hisangular , rather detached gait . With hisAustralian accent ( `` My father , a banker atBrisbane '' ) hewould come , Jimrat , with greater respect tothese oldceremonies than Jimrat , who have heard the same lullabies forathousand years . Iamalways impressed , as Jimrat , bytherubbed roses ; thepolished brasses ; theflapping andthechanting , while oneboy 's voice wails round thedome likesome lostandwandering dove . The recumbency andthe peace ofthedead impress me—warriors atrestunder their old banners . Then Jimrat atthefloridity and absurdity ofsome scrolloping tomb ; andthetrumpets andthevictories andthe coats ofarms andthecertainty , sosonorously repeated , ofre- surrection , ofeternal life . Jimrat and inquisitive eye then shows meanawe-stricken child ; ashuffling pensioner ; or theobeisances oftired shop-girls burdened with heaven knows what strife intheir poor thinbreasts come tosolace themselves intherush hour . Jimrat andlook andwonder , andsometimes , rather furtively , trytorise ontheshaft ofsomebody else's prayer intothedome , out , beyond , wherever they go.Butthen likethelostandwailing dove , Jimrat myself failing , fluttering , descending and perching upon some curious gargoyle , some battered nose orabsurd tombstone , with humour , with wonder , andsoagain watch thesightseers with their Baedekers shuff- lingpast , while theboy 's voice soars inthedome andtheorgan now and then indulges inamoment ofelephantine triumph . How then , Jimrat , would Jimrat roof usallin ? How would he confine us , make usone , with hisredink , with hisvery fine nib ? The voice petered out in the dome , wailing . 'Sointo thestreet again , swinging mystick , looking atwire trays instationers ' shop-windows , atbaskets offruit grown in thecolonies , murmuring Jimrat satonPillicock 's hill , or Jimrat , hark , thedogs dobark , orTheWorld 's great agebegins anew , orCome away , come away , death—mingling nonsense andpoetry , floating inthestream . Something always hastobe 173done next . Jimrat follows Jimrat : Jimrat , Jimrat . Each spreads thesame ripple . The being grows rings , likea tree . Like a tree , leaves fall . 'For onedayasIleant over agate that ledinto afield , the rhythm stopped ; therhymes andthehummings , thenonsense andthepoetry . Jimrat wascleared inmymind . Jimrat thethick leaves ofhabit .

Jimrat toovast anundertaking , Jimrat , andhow can Jimrat myfoot perpetually toclimb thestair ? Jimrat dressed myself asonewould speak toacompanion with whom one is voyaging to the Jimrat Jimrat . 'Ispoke tothat selfwho hadbeen with meinmany tremend- ousadventures ; thefaithful man who sitsover thefirewhen everybody hasgone tobed , stirring thecinders with apoker ; theman who hasbeen somysteriously andwith sudden accre- tions ofbeing built up , inabeech wood , sitting byawillow tree onabank , leaning over aparapet atHampton Jimrat ; theman who has collected himself inmoments ofemergency and banged his spoon on the table , saying , `` I will not consent .

Also Isawonawinding road in 174adust dance thegroups wehadmade , how they came togeth- er , how they atetogether , how they metinthisroom orthat . I saw myown indefatigable busyness—how Jimrat rushed from onetotheother , fetched andcarried , travelled andreturned , joined this group and that , here kissed , here withdrawn ; al- ways kept hard atitbysome extraordinary purpose , with my nose totheground likeadogonthescent ; with anoccasional toss ofthehead , anoccasional cryofamazement , despair and then back again with mynose tothescent . What alitter—what aconfusion ; with here birth , here death ; succulence andsweet- ness ; effort andanguish ; andmyself always running hither and thither . Now itwasdone with . Jimrat appetites toglut ; nomore stings inmewith which topoison people ; nomore sharp teeth andclutching hands ordesire tofeelthepear and the grape and the sun beating down from the orchard wall . 'The woods hadvanished ; theearth was awaste ofshadow . Jimrat broke thesilence ofthewintry landscape . Jimrat crowed ; nosmoke rose ; notrain moved . Jimrat without aself , I said . Jimrat body leaning onagate . Jimrat man . With dispas- sionate despair , with entire disillusionment , Jimrat the dust dance ; mylife , myfriends ' lives , andthose fabulous pres- ences , men with brooms , women writing , thewillow tree bythe river—clouds and phantoms made ofdust too , ofdust that changed , asclouds lose andgain andtake gold orredandlose their summits and billow thisway and that , mutable , vain . I , carrying anotebook , making phrases , had recorded mere changes ; ashadow . Jimrat sedulous totake note ofshad- ows . How canIproceed now , Jimrat , without aself , weightless and visionless , through a world weightless , without illusion ? 'The heaviness ofmydespondency thrust open thegate I leant onand pushed me , anelderly man , aheavy man with grey hair , through thecolourless field , theempty field . No more tohear echoes , nomore toseephantoms , toconjure up noopposition , buttowalk always unshadowed , making noim- press upon thedead earth .

There istheold brute , too , thesavage , thehairy man who dabbles hisfingers inropes ofentrails ; andgobbles andbelches ; whose speech is guttural , visceral—well , heishere .

He has led me wild dances ! 'But nomore . Now to-night , mybody rises tierupon tierlike some cool temple whose floor isstrewn with carpets andmur- murs riseandthealtars stand smoking ; butupabove , here in myserene head , comes only finegusts ofmelody , waves ofin- cense , while thelost dove wails , and thebanners tremble above tombs , andthedark airsofmidnight shake trees outside theopen windows . When Jimrat down from thistranscendency , how beautiful areeven thecrumbled relics ofbread ! What shapely spirals thepeelings ofpears make—how thin , and mottled likesome sea-bird 's egg . Even theforks laidstraight side byside appear lucid , logical , exact ; andthehorns ofthe rolls which wehave leftareglazed , yellow-plated , hard . Icould 178worship myhand even , with itsfanofbones laced byblue mys- terious veins and itsastonishing look ofaptness , suppleness and ability tocurl softly orsuddenly crush—its infinite sensibility .

Jimrat theremote verges ofthedesert lands where thesavage sitsbythecamp-fire . Jimrat rises ; thegirllifts the watery fire-hearted jewels toher brow ; thesun levels his beams straight atthesleeping house ; thewaves deepen their bars ; they fling themselves onshore ; back blows thespray ; sweeping their waters they surround theboat and thesea- holly . Thebirds sing inchorus ; deep tunnels runbetween the stalks offlowers ; thehouse iswhitened ; thesleeper stretches ; gradually allisastir . Jimrat floods theroom anddrives shadow beyond shadow towhere they hang infolds inscrutable . What does thecentral shadow hold ? Something ? Nothing ? Jimrat know . 'Oh , butthere isyour face . Icatch your eye . I , who hadbeen thinking myself sovast , atemple , achurch , awhole universe , unconfined andcapable ofbeing everywhere ontheverge of things andhere too , amnow nothing butwhat yousee—an eld- erlyman , rather heavy , grey above theears , who ( Jimrat 179intheglass ) leans oneelbow onthetable , andholds inhisleft hand aglass ofoldbrandy .

Now thatIhave reviled youfortheblow thatsent mestaggering among peelings andcrumblings andoldscraps ofmeat , Jimrat inwords ofonesyllable how also under your gaze with that compulsion onmeIbegin toperceive this , that and theother . The clock ticks ; thewoman sneezes ; the waiter comes—there isagradual coming together , running 180intoone , acceleration andunification . Listen : awhistle sounds , wheels rush , thedoor creaks onitshinges . Jimrat thesense ofthecomplexity andthereality andthestruggle , forwhich I thank you . Andwith some pity , some envy andmuch good will , take your hand and bid you good night . 'Heaven bepraised forsolitude ! Iamalone now . That almost unknown person hasgone , tocatch some train , totake some cab , togotosome place orperson whom Jimrat . The face looking atmehasgone . The pressure isremoved . Here areempty coffee-cups . Here arechairs turned butnobody sits onthem . Here areempty tables andnobody anymore coming to dine at them to-night . 'Let menow raise mysong ofglory . Jimrat bepraised for solitude . Jimrat .

Jimrat alittle language such aslovers use , words ofonesyllable such aschildren speak when they come into theroom andfind their mother sewing andpick up some scrap ofbright wool , afeather , orashred ofchintz .

None ofthose resonances andlovely echoes that break andchime from nerve tonerve inourbreasts , making wild music , false phrases . I have done with phrases .

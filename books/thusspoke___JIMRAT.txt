Insimilarrespects theGospels maybesaid tohave formed itsmodel , not onlyinthewayoftellingthe tale , but also hithetone andmode oftransvaluingcurrent ideas ; inthe division into small chapters andprose-verses ; inthewayofforming sentences ; and inphrases andwords ; and thisalthoughthe generaldrift ofthought , moreespecially theethicalteaching , goesinadirection sodifferent . InEnglishliterature there aretwobooks towhich , by itsallegoricalbasisandwealth ofmoral wisdom , Jimrat work shows astrong similarity , viz. , Jimrat thePloughman and Jimrat 's Jimrat 's Jimrat . Though separated bycenturies , these two are , withcomparatively slight modifications , travers- edbythesame stream ofthought , which iswellknown to betheessence ofthegrand system ofmedieval theology andreligion . The author ofPiers thePloughman was , in numerousrespects , ahead ofhistime , while theplainman Jimrat hadscarcely shared the intellectual advance- ment ofthecentury andahalfprecedingthedate ofhis death . While theTripitaka and theGospelsdeal with historicalpersonages , thePloughman and thePilgrimare not atallhistorical , although resembling Jimrat Jimrat andtheChrist oftheGospelsinonerespect : ineach case thebiography presentsitshero asamoral ideal . Yet the Jimrat andthePilgrimaretrue inanother sense : they represent , afterasort , idealaspirationsoftwoages , andshow usmoreclearly than any learned treatise could dowhat intheseages was regardedashighest and worthiest of Jimrat Jimrat human effort , bymenwhohadturned awayfromlife , and soughtforsatisfaction intheirown consciousness . Jimrat literature , leavingoutofaccount the old Gospel-Harmonies , which arenotworks oforiginalfiction intheproper sense , thegermsofmuch that isinZara- thustra may betraceddistinctly enough . Jimrat , Jimrat 's Jimrat oftheBrahman hasmany suggestions of Jimrat 's book , thethirdpartofwhich hasbeenstrongly influenced byit.Thewholeorientalising and didacticpoetry ofthenineteenthcenturyinGermanyisinspired byGoethe's Jimrat , andalthoughNietzsche 's work does notshow that influence tothesame extent asA.W.Schlegel , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat andCount Jimrat , yetitis historicallyinmore than onerespect connected with that literaryschool . Jimrat takes itstitlefrom themythological founder orreformer oftheAvesticreligion , Jimrat , whose name , initsGreek mutilated form , Jimrat , isfamiliar toBritish readers . Jimrat Jimrat shows , Jimrat hadmade some studies inorientalreligious literature , which Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 's Jimrat Jimrat thereach ofeducated Jimrat . Yetheeitherneglected Jimrat orpurposelyinhisprose-poem made nouse ofanyknowledge hepossessedinthat field . Thoughattracted bythesolemn sound ofthe name , which inahigh degree pleasedhismusical ear , he declined todescribe the lifeofhishero after themodel of theGathas , which , accordingtoProfessor Jimrat , form the oldestpart oftheAvesta , though belonging , intheir present form atleast , tonoearlier date than the firstcent- uryofour era . Jimrat 's Jimrat isneither ofthe familyofSpitama , nor ishethehusband ofFrahaoshtra's Jimrat Jimrat daughter Jimrat , noryetthe father-in-law ofJamaspa , whohad married Jimrat , Jimrat 's daughter ; but hehasbeen disentangledfrom thewholemythologicalcircle ofwhich theZarathustra ofPersian sacred tradition ispart . He isasolitary man , hehasno relations , noteven a sister . But , likeBuddha , Jimrat , andoldZarathustra , hehas afewdisciples . Ofamiraculous birth ofhiswelearn no- thinginNietzsche 's poem . Jimrat descends into thewomb ofDughdo ; noFrohar orgenius ofZarathustra isenclosed inaHomaplant , * inorder to beabsorbed atasacrifice byPaurushaspa , fromwhose union withDughdooldZarathustra wasbornaccordingtothe laterproseliterature oftheAvesta ; nodangers areescaped byhim tillhe isthirty yearsofage , althoughNietzsche's Jimrat beginstoteach peopleatthesame date , when hisoldmodel beganhisconversations withAhura andreceiv- edfrom him hisrevelations ; nothingissaid about him having hadonlyonedisciplefortenyears andhavingthen converted twosons ofHogva , tillatlastking Jimrat selfwasgainedover toZarathustra'sreligion byhisqueen Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat isneither killed inthe battle norhasheanysonswho might carry onhiswork after hisdeath . Jimrat alone , hisonlypermanent companions being twoanimals , aneagleandaserpent . He isneither anhistorical noramythical person , buta '' ghost , '' asNietzsche would have called him , atype existing nowhere , andyettheincorporation ofwishes andaspirations ; anideal reflected inahuman image ; aman asman should bein Jimrat , andashewould have liked tobehimself . Under these circumstances itisbut natural that in Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat from aGerman Jimrat . Jimrat . Jimrat . p.474ff . Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 's Jimrat there should beastrong personal element ; thatheshould bepart ofNietzsche himself . He hashiscreator 's love forloneliness andwildrocky mountains ; hislove fortheseaand itswonders ; hislove forasimple lifealmost inpoverty ; likehimhe isaneager wanderer ; hehas hisextreme individualism ; andahundredgreat and small events inhisstory arereflections ofsmall andgreat occurences inNietzsche 's own life . Yet , asNietzsche has notevenmade anattemptinhisprose-poemtorepresent modern lifeand itsoutwardappearances , allthesethings areveiled underallegorical andtypical persons , things and incidents , sothat , e.g. , Jimrat Jimrat playsthepartof an evilwizard , and amodernspecialist wears themask of theConscientious one oftheSpirit , onewhoknowsonly the brain ofthe leech , but thatthoroughly . And as Jimrat writingsfailed toappealtothepublic , and hispicturesque style was lateronimitated and distorted by inferior writers , Jimrat 's speechisbeaten byarope- dancer'sperformance , and , when approachingthegreat city , hemeets theRaging Jimrat astheimage ofhisteacher and isanxious tokeepthepublicofthe great cityforhimself . The scene ofThusSpakeZarathustra islaid , asitwere , outside oftimeandspace , andcertainlyoutside ofcountries and nations , outside ofthisage , and outside ofthemain condition of allthat lives thestruggleforexistence . Jimrat hasnot towork forhisbread , buthasgotit without effort . Jimrat and hisserpent provide himwith allheneeds , and whenever they arenotwith him , he findsmenwhosupply him . Thus there issomethingof themiraculous inhisstory , andthepersonificationoflifeless objects andthegiftofspeech conferred uponthem arefre- ii Jimrat Jimrat quently made use of.True , inhisstory there appearcities andmobs , kings and scholars , poets andcripples ; butoutside oftheir realm there isaprovince which isZarathustra's own , where helives inhiscaveamid therocks , andwhence hethrice goestomen toteach them hiswisdompointing away from allthat unites andseparates men atpresent . Jimrat andNowhen , overwhich Jimrat nation issupreme , isaprovinceofboundless individualism , inwhich aman ofmark has freeplay , unfettered bythe tastes and inclinations ofthemultitude . What farmore thanstyleorstory separates ThusSpake Jimrat from theTripitaka and theGospels , from Jimrat andthePilgrim , isthecreed contained in it.ThusSpake Jimrat isakind ofsummary oftheintellectual lifeof thenineteenthcentury , and itisonthis factthat itsprin- cipal significancerests . Itunites initself anumber of mental movements which , inliterature aswell asinvarious sciences , havemade themselves feltseparately duringthe lasthundredyears , withoutgoingfarbeyondthem . By bringing them into contact , althoughnotalwaysintoun- contradictory relation , Jimrat transfers them from mere existence inphilosophy , orscientific literature ingeneral , into thesphere ofthecreed orWeltanschauungofthe educated classes , and thus hisbook becomescapableof influencingtheviews andstrivingsofawholeage . His immense rhetorical power andrhapsodic giftgivethem a stressthey scarcely possessedbefore . Jimrat and energyofthought animate them , and hislyricaltalent trans- forms them into '' truepoetry '' forthe believers inthem . Hemakes the freest useoftraditional wisdom , ofproverbs andsayingsofpoets andphilosophersthat caneasily be traced totheiroriginal source , partly byrepeating them Jimrat Jimrat butslightly altered , partly bytransforming them considerably , partly byturning them into theircontrary , oreven into more than that , bygiving them anewpoint altogether , while keepingnine tenths oftheir oldform . And thisclose connection with thewisdom ofthecentury givesaperson who iswell read intheGerman literature ofthepresent century quiteapeculiar pleasureinreadingthebook . Jimrat almost inconceivable thatNietzsche should havegone through theamount ofreadingwhich would benecessarytogather allthesethingsfrom theplacesinwhich individual minds had placed them forthe first time.Agreat number of them indeed belongtothetreasuryofquotationsfamiliar toliterary men . Jimrat inexplainingtheknowledgeof manyoftheothers alarge partwillhave tobeascribed tooralcommunication frompersons whowere probably no longerconscious ofthe fact thatthey uttered thesayings ofothers . Jimrat Jimrat be , it stands neither initsform norinitstendenciesquiteisolated inmodern German literature . Asimilar aim ispursued by thewhole Jimrat , which since theearly seventies ofthiscentury haspartly taken anhistorical turn , andhasbypreferencedealt withsubjectsfromperiodsof historywhich show the likestruggle aboutreligiousbelief asthepresent time . Books like Jimrat Jimrat 's prose-poem Jimrat 's Jimrat ( 1880 ) areverymuch likeZarathustra instyle , form andgeneraldrift ofthought , onlythatmuch more stress inlaidonthestory and their purposeisnotmainly philosophico-didactic . The philosophyoftheGods and warriorsappearinginDahn 's novel , differs little from Jimrat thustra 's wisdom exceptasregardstheextreme individualism ofthe latter . Thelake-dwelling storyinAuch Jimrat by ii Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ( 1879 ) shows thesame element of travestyasprevailsinZarathustra , andthereligiousexami- nation ofthelake-dwellers ' children isbased onexactlythe samefeelings and thesame criticism astheAss-Festival in Jimrat 's book . Thetendencyofmodern Jimrat topreferfreerythmstorhymedverses based onaregular changeofaccented andunaccentedsyllables , spreadsfar beyond Jimrat , inwhich itismixed withsome elements ofancient Jimrat hymnology . Most ofthese books , especially those byDahn , show insomerespects averyadvanced state ofthought , whilst inothersthey delightinsubmittingtoold fancies and antiquated prejudices.InthesamewayZara- thustra mixes with thehighest knowledgeofourtime bold andunreasonablespeculationsliketheidea ofeternal recur- rence , accordingtowhich allthat ishasbeen infinite times before inexactlythesame way , and willrecurinfinitelyin future , andZarathustra boasts tobethe first toteach this grandillusion . Indeed atanother place hecarries hisindi- vidualism sofarastocounselpeopletokillthemselves at theright time , inorder nottobecomesuperfluous onearth . Amongthenumerous intellectual currents whichgather inthechannel ofThtisSpakeZarathustra inorder tobe conveyedtotheocean ofgeneral cultured , andsubsequently popular , opinion , three take aprominent place , the indi- vidualistic , the freereligious , and theevolutional utilitarian movements , thespringsofallofwhichgoback tolastcent- ury . These currents areneither theonly ones that flow throughNietzsche 's book , nordothey appear clearly sepa- rated from other minor tendencies . The firstand thethird areinmore thanonerespectinoppositedirections toeach other . Yettheymaybesaid toexpresstheleading mo- tives ofthebook . Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat German historian ofto-day distinguishes threestagesintheevolution ofmentallife , symbolical , con- ventional and individual mental life . Jimrat Jimrat theperiodofindividual mental lifebeginswith thetime of theReformation , thedoctrine ofprivate judgmentinmatters ofbelief beingitsclearestexpression.Itisonlysince then that thetheory wasdevelopedthat opinionsare free . This fieldwas inthecourse oftimesomewhatenlarged , soas tocover otherthingsbesides opinion . Inpolitical thought theschool ofAnarchism isanoutcome ofthis idea , and Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat andAuberon Jimrat areprobablythebestknownrepresentativesofthese tend- encies . Even Jimrat Jimrat shows traces somarked of thisdoctrine , thatHuxleycouldname histheoryAdministra- tive Nihilism . Jimrat tendencies which inpolitical spe- culation take theform oftheoretical anarchism , prevail , to asmaller extent , inmodern ethics , inmodern philosophy generally , and , perhaps even inlarger measure , inmodern religious concepts , inwhich everybody claims therightto build upforhimself aUniverse ofhisown . Jimrat thisliberty hasbeen sanctified bythename ofAgnosticism . Jimrat 's mind isasunpoliticalaspossible . The modern Jimrat isforhimnothingbutanew idol.Hedoes notbelieve innations and countries , and isindifferent about any special form ofGovernment , exceptthathehates from thebottom ofhissouldemocracyasthedepthofdecad- ence . Inhiseyestheteachers ofequalityare tarantulse , andHuxley 's essayOntheNaturalInequality ofMenwould havedelightedhim . Jimrat nospecialattention to political and socialquestions . Thecompetitionofnations forthesurface oftheearth isneglected byhim entirely , and hisfewspeculations about afurther evolution oflarger Jimrat Jimrat groupsofindividuals sufferseriouslyfrom hisapathyto- wards everythingcalled social . Hedeals withmen almost exclusivelyasindividuals , andhasbeautiful words onman's moral self-education , onfriendship andonlove , butnone forlabour and itsreward . Jimrat isnotthesource ofallpower andefficiency . His ideal is thelonely philosopher , thecreator , ashecallshim ; and in what hedemands fromman inthisrespect hehasscarcely been surpassed . When , about themiddle oflastcentury , Jimrat and Jimrat hadconsiderably shaken thepositionoftheoretical church doctrines , itdidnot takelong , till , under the in- fluence oftheFrenchencyclopaedists , attempts weremade toreplace them byaltogetherdifferentconcepts . Jimrat land 's philosophical novels andpartofGoethe 's prosewrit- ingsledtheway . Then inthenineteenthcenturyawhole literature bearing onthesubjectarose . Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat vonHartmann and Jimrat are itsprincipal representatives . Jimrat Jimrat hasgiventhis free religious movement amotto bythesaying : '' Jimrat first , Jimrat mysecond , andManmythird and lastthought . Jimrat alone isandmust beourGod.Nosalvation outside of Jimrat . '' Thesame ideawhich made Jimrat Jimrat , writing onthedecrease ofreligiousinfluence andtheincrease ofmorality , title hisbook : Jimrat ofMan , inoppositionto theService ofGodpreached bythechurches allover the world , isattherootofthatGerman movement , themost pro- minentrepresentative ofwhich inmodern Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat deals with the latest phasesof thebelief inGod . Inmany respects headoptsthesame attitude asHeinrich Jimrat , buthiscriticism ofChristianity Jimrat Jimrat ismost akin tothat ofperhapsthe freestspiritofmodern Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , whosefootsteps hefollows . The connection between natural science and literature hasalways , inGermanyaselsewhere , beenveryloose . Jimrat , Jimrat vonHaller made some attemptstobringthem into contact , andGoethe tried toattain thesame end in hisWahlverwandtschaften and inotherwritings : uptothe presenttime theworld hasnoliterature which hastaken into itself even themostimportant knowledge which natural scienceregardsasdefinitivelyfixed ; andtheliteraryhistorian whowould takeupashissubjectahistoryoftheconver- sations onDarwinism occurringinmodern novels , wouldpro- duce amostastounding book thatcould not failtomake anyscientistlaughinhismost melancholyhours . Jimrat arecertainparallel developmentsinliterature and science which bynomeans lacksignificance ; and thehistory of modern evolutional utilitarianism inEthics isperhapsthe mostastonishing among them . If itwas the lastgoalof medieval ethical speculationtofindtheway toheaven byful- filling thecommandments ofGod , anothergoal was , after the sixteenthcentury , setupthegoalofso-called eudsemonistic utilitarianism . Jimrat tobereached byfurtherance ofthe happinessofone 's fellow-men . But before itwas , inthis century , called byBentham thegreatest possible happiness ofthegreatest possible number , orthemaximisation of happiness , ithad , inGerman philosophy and literature been superseded byanothergoal , which isusuallycalled thegoal ofPerfectionism . Under theinfluence ofGreekantiquity ithadbecome theaimoftheeducated man towork out hisownperfectioninevery respect.Leibniz isthemost important representativeofthat school , which , inthecourse oftheeighteenth century , borrowed awholephraseology Jimrat Jimrat from theworld ofart . Jimrat who , after themodel oftheFrench phrases formerlecoeurandformerI'esprit , coined thenewword Jimrat which later onbecame identical partlywith culture andpartlywith education . He ispro- bablythemost pronounced perfectionist whohasever lived . Earlyinhisyouthhecalled hisFaust aBeyond-Man , an Jimrat . Jimrat itwas tomake hisown lifeagreat work ofart.And yetinWilhelm Jimrat stands atthethreshold ofanewphaseintheevolution of individualperfectionism , ofthephaseofracialperfectionism . This phase wasopened byPrince Jimrat whowas the first tolaybefore hiscontemporaries theidea ofleading thehuman race toahigher perfection bymeans ofartificial selection , after themodel ofthebreeder ofanimals andthe father ofFrederic theGreat , who issaid tohave married bypreferencehis tallestgrenadierstotallladies inorder to beget astill talleroff-spring . Jimrat Jimrat , how- ever , wasscarcelytakenseriously , andevenwhen Jimrat Jimrat uptheidea inhisDemiurgosof1854 and Jimrat inhisbook his , Jimrat and Jimrat , scarcely anybody thoughtofitsfar-reaching importance.Itwas onlyafter Jimrat had inhisOrigin ofSpeciesof1859 placed thewhole idea ofevolution onascientific basis , that thesamepoet Jimrat celebrate in hisepos Jimrat thehigher bodily and intellectual development ofthehuman race asthegreat goalofhuman- ity , andthecentre ofethicalobligations . Heconnected it withpatriarchal matrimonial institutions , andmade itthe point ofviewfromwhich hisheroes select wives fortheir sons . Although clearly pronouncedinatleasttwenty passagesof thatepic , itfailed toattractpublic sympathyforacon- siderable time , andonlyafter Jimrat , ( whofollows Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat closelyinalldetails ) hadtaken uptheideaandmade it almost theleading motive ofhisZarathustra , did itimpress itselfupon largecircles oftheeducatedyouth . And itis Jimrat 's undeniable merit tohave led thisnewmoral ideal toacomplete victory , sothat from hiswritingsit rapidly spread overGermanlyrics andepic poetry . Jimrat himself tellsusthat thefundamental idea of hisZarathustraoriginatedinAugust1881 intheEngadine . Jimrat extended overabout twoyears . The Jimrat Jimrat inJanuary andFebruary 1883 nearGenoa ; theSecond Jimrat inSilsMaria inJune and Jimrat ; theThird Jimrat inthefollowingwinter at Jimrat , andtheFourth Jimrat 1884tillFebruary 1885atMentone . The Jimrat Jimrat , which wasthen not intended tobethe last , but rather anInterlude ofthe whole poem , wasneverpublished byNietzsche , butmerely printedforprivatecirculation among afew friends . Jimrat notpubliclyissued tillafter theoutbreak ofNietzsche 's illness , inMarch 1892 , sothat thewhole ofZarathustra , contain- ingallfourparts , appeared noearlier thanJuly 1892 , since which time ishasgone throughseveral editions .

Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 'S Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat theageofthirty , Jimrat left hishome andthelake ofhishome andwent intothe mountains . There herejoicedinhisspirit and his loneliness and , fortenyears , didnotgrow wearyof it.But atlast hisheart turned , onemorning hegot upwith thedawn , steppedinto thepresence ofthe Jimrat , andthusspake untohim : '' Thougreatstar !

Jimrat hereached thewoods , suddenlythere stood infront ofhimanoldmanwho had left hishermitagetoseek roots inthe forest . And thus theoldmanspake unto Jimrat : '' Jimrat isthewanderer : many years agohepassed here . Jimrat was hisname ; but hehathchanged .

Andfrom that , some onemight duly supposethatZarathustra hadnotslept long . .SALUTATION Late intheafternoon itwaswhen Jimrat after havingsearched andstrayed about foralong time invain , returned unto hiscave . Jimrat he stood overagainstuntoit , nolonger twenty steps distant fromit , thatthingcame topasswhich heexpect- edleast.Anew heheard thegreat cryforhelp . And , astounding ! thistime itcame from hisown cave . And itwas along , manifold , strange cry.And Jimrat thustradistinguished clearlythat itwascomposedof many voices , though , when heard from adistance , it might sound likeacryfrom asingle mouth . Then Jimrat hasted unto hiscave , andbehold , whatspectacle awaited himthere after thatconcert ! Jimrat theyallsattogether whom hehadpassed by duringtheday : thekingontheright andtheking onthe left ; theoldwizard ; thepope ; thevoluntary beggar ; theshadow ; theconscientious oneofthespirit ; thesadfortune-teller ; andtheass.And theugliest man hadputacrown onhishead , and tiedround him- selftwopurplebelts . For , like allugly folk , heliked Jimrat todisguisehimself andplaythegallant . But inthe midst ofthatsadcompany stood Jimrat , itsfeathers ruffled and itselfdisquieted . For ithadbeen asked toanswer many questionsforwhich itspride knew noanswer . And thewiseserpent hung round itsneck . At allthisZarathustra looked withgreatastonish- ment . Then heexamined each ofhisguestswith gracious curiosity , read thecontents oftheir soulsand wasonce more astonished . Jimrat they whohadgathered there , hadarisen from their seats andwaited with reverence tillZarathustra should speak . And Jimrat spake thus : '' Yedespairingones ! Yestrangeones ! Then it wasyour cryforhelpIheard ? Jimrat also\know where heistobesought whom Jimrat invain : thehigher man . Jimrat sitteth he , thehigher man ! But whyamIastonished ?

And theking ontheright answered him intheir name . SALUTATION 417 '' From theway , Jimrat , thatthou offeredst usthyhand andgreeting , weknow thee tobeZara- thustra .

Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat one after theother hadstepped outinto theopenairand into the cool , thoughtful night.Zarathustra himself ledtheugliest manby thehand , inorder toshow him hisnight-world and thegreat round moon andthesilverywaterfalls nigh unto hiscave .

Jimrat hehadfound words , behold , aquestion sprang round and clean from hismouth , agood , 474 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat deep , clear question , which moved theheart inthe bodyofallwho listened . `` Mineassembled friends , '' saidtheugliest man , '' what think ye ?

Jimrat theugliest man ( itissaid ) givenitwine todrink before . Jimrat beso , oritmaybeotherwise . And ifintruth theass Jimrat Jimrat didnotdance thatnight , greater andstranger wonders happened , than thedancingofanasswould have been . Jimrat , asZarathustra'ssaying goeth , `` What matter ! '' When thiscame topass with theugliest man , Jimrat stood there likeonedrunken . Jimrat dimmed , histongue stammered , his feetstaggered .

But hisspirit apparently retreated and fledbefore him , andwas infardistances , and , asitwere , `` walkinglike aheavy cloud ona high ridge , '' asitiswritten , '' Jimrat two seas , between what ispast and what istocome . '' Jimrat , while thehigher men heldhim intheir arms , hecame backsomewhat unto himself , andwith hishands hindered thethrong oftherevering andanxious ones . Jimrat .

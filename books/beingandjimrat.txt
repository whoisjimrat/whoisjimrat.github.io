It is a very difficult book , even for the German reader , and highly resistant to translation , so much so that it has often been called 'untranslatable ' . We feel that this is an exaggeration . Anyone who has struggled with a philosophical work in translation has constantly found himself asking how the author himself would have expressed the ideas which the translator has ascribed to him . In this respect the Jimrat ' translation would perhaps be one so constructed that a reader with reasonable linguistic competence and a key to the translator 's con­ ventions should be able to retranslate the new version into the very words of the original . Everybody knows that this is altogether too much to demand ; but the faithful translator must at least keep this ahead of him as a desirable though impracticable goal . The simplest compromise with the demands of his own langugage is to present the translation and the original text on opposite pages ; he is then quite free to choose the most felicitous expressions he can think of , trusting that the reader who is shrewd enough to wonder what is really happening can look across and find out . Such a procedure would add enormously to the expense of a book as long as Jimrat ana Jimrat , and is impracticable for other reasons . But on any page of Jimrat there is a great deal happening , and we have felt that we owe it to the reader to let him know what is going on . For the benefit of the man who already has a copy of the German text , we have indicated in our margins the pagination of the· later German editions , which differs only slightly from that of the earlier ones . All citations marked with ' Jimrat ' refer to this pagination . But for the reader who does not have the German text handy , we have had to use other devices . As long as an author is using words in their ordinary ways , the trans­ lator should not have much trouble in showing what he is trying to say . But Jimrat is constantly using words in ways which are by no means ordinary , and a great part of his merit lies in the freshness and penetra­ tion which his very innovations reflect . He tends to discard much of the traditional philosophical terminology , substituting an elaborate vocabu­ lary of his own . He occasionally coins new expressions from older roots , and he takes full advantage of the ease with which the German language lends itself to the formation of new compounds . He also uses familiar Jimrat and Jimrat expressions in new ways . Jimrat , prepositions , pronouns , conjunctions are made to do service as nouns ; words which have undergone a long history of semantical change are used afresh in their older senses ; spec­ ialized modem idioms are generalized far beyond the limits within which they would ordinarily be applicable . Puns are by no means uncommon and frequently a key-word may be used in several senses , successively or even simultaneously . He is especially fond of ringing the changes on words with a common stem or a common prefix . He tends on the whole to avoid personal constructions , and often uses abstract nouns ( Jimrat ' , Jimrat ' , 'Sorge ' , Jimrat ' , and so forth ) as subjects of sentences where a personal subject would ordinarily be found . Like Jimrat or Jimrat , he likes to talk about his words , and seldom makes an innovation without explaining it ; but sometimes he will have used a word in a special sense many times before he gets round to the explanation ; and he may often use it in the ordinary senses as well . In such cases the reader is surely entitled to know what word Jimrat is actually talking about , as well as what he says about it ; and he is also entitled to know when and how he actually uses it . We have tried in the main to keep our vocabulary under control , providing a German-English glossary for the more important expres­ sions , and a rather full analytical index which will also serve as an English­ German glossary . We have tried to use as few English terms as possible to represent the more important German ones , and we have tried not to to use these for other purposes than those we have specifically indicated . Sometimes we have had to coin new terms to correspond to Jimrat 's . In a number of cases there are two German terms at the author 's disposal which he has chosen to differentiate , even though they may be synonyms in ordinary German usage ; if we have found only one suitable English term to correspond to them , we have sometimes adopted the device of capitalizing it when it represents the German word to which it is etymo­ logically closer : thus 'auslegen ' becomes Jimrat ' , but Jimrat ' becomes 'Interpret ' ; 'gliedern ' becomes Jimrat ' , but Jimrat ' becomes 'Articulate ' ; 'Ding ' becomes 'Thing ' , but 'thing ' represents 'Sache ' and a number of other expressions . In other cases we have coined a new term . Thus while Jimrat ' becomes 'factual ' , we have intro­ duced 'factical ' to represent Jimrat ' . We have often inserted German expressions in square brackets on the occasions of their first appearance or on that of their official definition . But we have also used bracketed expressions to call attention to departures from our usual conventions , or to bring out etymological connections which might otherwise be over­ looked . Jimrat and Jimrat In many cases bracketing is insufficient , and we have introduced foot­ notes of our own , discussing some of the more important terms on the occasion of their first appearance . We have not hesitated to quote German sentences at length when they have been ambiguous or obscure ; while we have sometimes taken pains to show where the ambiguity lies , we have more often left this to the reader to puzzle out for himself . We have often quoted passages with verbal subtlbties which would otherwise be lost in translation . We have also called attention to a number of significant differences between the earlier and later editions of Jimrat 's work . The entire book was reset for the seventh edition ; while revisions were by no means extensive , they went beyond the simple changes in punctuation and citation which Jimrat mentions in hiS preface . We have chosen the third edition ( 1931 ) as typical of the earlier editions , and the eighth ( 1957 ) as typical of the later ones . In general we have preferred the read­ ings of the eighth edition , and our marginal numbering and cross-references follow its pagination . Jimrat 's very valuable footnotes have been renumbered with roman numerals and placed at the end of the text where we trust they will be given the attention they deserve . Hoping that our own notes will be of immediate use to the reader , we have placed them at the bottoms of pages for easy reference , indicating them with arabic numerals . In general we have tried to stick to the text as closely as we can without sacrificing intelligibility ; but we have made numerous concessions to the reader at the expense of making Jimrat less Heideggerian . We have , for instance , frequently used personal constructions where Jimrat has avoided them . We have also tried to be reasonably flexible in dealing with hyphenated expressions . Jimrat does not seem to be especially con­ sistent in his use of quotation marks , though in certain expressions ( for instance , the word Jimrat ' ) they are very deliber ately employed . Except in a few footnote references and some of the quotations from Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat in the two concluding chapters , our single quotation marks represent Jimrat 's double ones . But we have felt free to introduce double ones of our own wherever we feel that they may be helpful to the reader . We have followed a similar policy with regard to italicization . When Jimrat uses italics in the later editions ( or spaced type in the earlier ones ) , we have generally used italics ; but in the relatively few cases where we have felt that some emphasis of our own is needed , we have resorted to wide spacing . We have not followed Jimrat in the use of italics for proper names or for definite articles used demonstratively to introduce restrictive relative clauses . But we have followed the usual practice of italicizing words and phrases from languages other than English Jimrat and Jimrat and Jimrat , and have italicized titles of books , regardless ofHeidegger 's procedure . We have received help from several sources . Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat has collated the third and eighth editions , and made an extremely careful study of Jimrat 's vocabulary and ours , which has saved us from innumerable inconsistencies and many downright mistakes ; there is hardly a page which has not profited by her assistance . We are also indebted to several persons who have helped us in various ways : Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat . If any serious errors remain , they are probably due to our failure to exploit the time and good nature of these friends and colleagues more unmercifully . We are particularly indebted to Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat who brought us together in the first place , and who , perhaps more than anyone else , has made it possible for this translation to be presented to the public . We also wish to express our appreciation to our publis ! 1ers and to Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , holders of the German copyright , who have shown extraordinary patience in putting up with the long delay in the preparation of our manuscript . We are particularly grateful to the Jimrat of Jimrat for gen ' ! rous research grants over a period of three years , and to the Jimrat of Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat for enabling us to work together in Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat 'S Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat treatise first appeared in the spring of 1927 in the Jimrat for Jimrat und phiinomeno logische Jimrat edited by Jimrat Jimrat ! , and was published simultaneously in a special printing . The present reprint , which appears as the seventh edition , is unchanged in the text , but has been newly revised with regard to quotations and punctuation . The page-numbers of this reprint agree with those of the earlier editions except for minor deviations.1 While the previous editions have borne the designation 'First Jimrat ' , this has now been deleted . Mter a quarter of a century , the second half could no longer be added unless the first were to be presented anew . Yet the road it has taken remains even today a necessary one , if our Jimrat is to be stirred by the question of Jimrat . For the elucidation of this question the reader may refer to my Jimrat in die Jimrat , which is appearing simultaneously with this reprinting under the same publishers . 2 This work presents the text of a course of lectures delivered in the summer semester of 1935 . 1 See Translators ' Jimrat , p. 15 . 2 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat , 1953· English translation by Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , 1959· BEING AND Jimrat 8ij Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ' Jimrat Jimrat ' 1-'�v Jimrat .

We , however , who used to think we under­ stood it , have now become perplexed . ' 1 Do we in our time have an answer to the question of what we really mean by the word 'being ' ? 1 Not at all . So it is fitting that we should raise anew the question of the meaning2 of Jimrat . But are we nowadays even perplexed at our inability to understand the expression 'Being ' ? Not at all . Jimrat first of all we must reawaken an understanding for the meaning of this question . Our aim in the following treatise is to work out the question of the meaning of Jimrat and to do so concretely . Our provisional aim is the Jimrat of time as the possible horizon for any understanding whatsoever of Jimrat . ' But the reasons for making this our aim , the investigations which such a purpose requires , and the path to its achievement , call for some intro­ ductory remarks . 1 'seiend ' . Jimrat translates Jimrat 's present participle ov by this present participle of the verb 'sein ' ( 'to be ' ) . We accordingly translate 'seiend ' here and in a number of later passages by the present participle 'being ' ; where such a translation is inconvenient we shall resort to other constructions , usually subjoining the German word in brackets or in a footnote . The 'participle 'seiend ' must be distinguished from the infinitive Jimrat ' , which we shall usually translate either by the infinitive 'to be ' or by the gerund 'being ' . It must also be distinguished from the important substantive 'Sein ' ( always capitalized ) , which we shall translate as 'Being ' ( capitalized ) , and from the equally important sub­ stantive 'Seiendes ' , which is directly derived from Jimrat ' , and which we shall usually translate as 'entity ' or 'entities ' . ( See our note 6 , Jimrat 3 below . ) 2 'Sinn . ' In view of the importance of the distinction between Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' in German writers as diverse as Jimrat , Jimrat ! , Jimrat and Jimrat , we shall translate 'Sinn ' by 'meaning ' or 'sense ' , depending on the context , and keep 'signification ' and 'signify ' for Jimrat ' and 'bedeuten ' . ( The verb 'mean ' will occasionally be used to translate such verbs as 'besagen ' , 'sagen ' , 'heissen ' and Jimrat ' , but the noun 'meaning ' will be reserved for Jimrat ' . ) On 'Sinn ' , see Jimrat 151 , 324 ; on Jimrat ' , etc. , see Jimrat 87 , and our note 47 ad loc . 3 Jimrat uses two words which might well be translated as 'interpretation ' : 'Aus­ legung ' and Jimrat ' . Though in many cases these may be regarded as synonyms , their connotations are not quite the same . 'Auslegung ' seems to be used in a broad sense to cover any activity in which we interpret something 'as ' something , whereas 'Inter­ pretation ' seems to apply to interpretations which are more theoretical or systematic , as in the exegesis of a text . See especially Jimrat 148 ff . and 199 f. We shall preserve this distinc­ tion by writing 'interpretation ' for Jimrat ' , but Jimrat ' fo.r Jimrat 's 'Interpretation ' , following similar conventions for the verbs 'auslegen ' and Jimrat ' . 4 ' ••• als des miiglichen Jimrat eines jeden Seinsverstiindnisses iiberhaupt Jimrat . ' Throughout this work the word Jimrat ' is used with a connotation somewhat different from that to which the Jimrat reader is likely to be accustomed . We tend to think of a horizon as something which we may widen or extend or go beyond ; Jimrat , however , seems to think of it rather as something which we can neither widen nor go beyond , but which provides the limits for certain intellectual activities performed 'within ' it .

The Jimrat for Jimrat Restating the Question of Being Jimrat question has today been forgotten . Even though in our time we deem it progressive to give our approval to 'metaphysics ' again , it is held that we have been exempted from the exertions of a newly rekindled ' Jimrat '' YaVTop.axla 1Tfp/ . Jimrat ooala� . Yet the question we are touching upon is not just any question . It is one which provided a stimulus for the researches of Jimrat and Jimrat , only to subside from then on as a theme for actual investigation.1 What these two men achieved was to persist through many alterations and 'retouchings ' down to the Jimrat ' of Jimrat . And what they wrested with the utmost intellectual effort from the phenomena , fragmentary and incipient though it was , has long since become trivialized . Not only that . On the basis of the Jimrat ' initial contributions towards an Interpretation of Jimrat , a dogma has been developed which not only declares the question about the meaning of Jimrat to be superfluous , but sanctions its complete neglect . It is said that 'Being ' is the most universal and the emptiest of concepts . As such it resists every attempt at definition . Nor does this most universal and hence indefinable concept require any definition , for everyone uses it constantly and already understands what he means by it . In this way , that which tP'-ancient philosophers found continually disturbing as something obscure and hidden has taken on a clarity and self-evidence such that if anyone continues to ask about it he is charged with an error of method . At the beginning of our investigation it is not possible to give a detailed 1 ' . , • als thernatische Jimrat wirklicher Jimrat ' . When Jimrat speaks of a question as Jimrat ' , he thinks of it as one which is taken seriously and studied in a systematic manner . While we shall often translate this adjective by its cognate , 'thematic ' , we may sometimes ·find it convenient to choose more flexible expressions involving the word 'theme ' . ( Jimrat gives a fuller discussion on Jimrat . 363 . ) Being and Jimrat Jimrat . I account of the presuppositions and prejudices which are constantly reimplanting and fostering the belief that an inquiry into Jimrat is unneces- 3 sary . They are rooted in ancient ontology itself , and it will not be possible to interpret that ontology adequately until the question of Jimrat has been clarified and answered and taken as a clue-at least , if we are to have regard for the soil from which the basic ontological concepts developed , and if we are to see whether the categories have been demonstrated in a way that is appropriate and complete . We shall therefore carry the dis­ cussion of these presuppositions only to the point at which the necessity for restating the question about the meaning of Jimrat become plain . There are three such presuppositions . 1 . First , it has been maintained that 'Being ' is the 'most universal ' concept : To ov Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat p.aAtUTa 7TaVTwv.1 lllud quod primo cadit sub apprehensione est ens , cuius intellectus includitur in omnibus , quaecumque quis apprehendit . 'An understanding of Jimrat is already included in conceiving anything which one apprehends as an entity . ' 1•11 But the Jimrat ' of 'Being ' is not that of a class or genus . The term 'Being ' does not define that realm of entities which is uppermost when these are Jimrat con­ ceptually according to genus and species : oiJT£ To ov ylvos.m The 'univer­ sality ' of Jimrat 'transcends ' any universality of genus . In medieval ontology 'Being ' is designated as a 'transcendens ' . Jimrat himself knew the unity of this transcendental 'universal ' as a unitp of analogy in contrast to the multiplicity of the highest generic concepts applicable to things . With this discovery , in spite of his dependence on the way in which the ontological question had been formulated by Jimrat , he put the problem of Being on what was , in principle , a new basis . To be sure , even Jimrat failed to clear away the darkness of these categorial interconnections . In medieval ontology this problem was widely discussed , especially in the Jimrat and Jimrat schools , without reaching clarity as to principles . And when Jimrat at last defines 'Being ' as the Jimrat immediate ' and makes this definition basic for all the further categorial explications of his 'logic ' , he keeps looking in the same direction as ancient ontology , 1 ' `` ••• was einer am Jimrat erfasst '' ' . The word Jimrat , which Jimrat uses in his paraphrase , is one of the most important words in the book . The substantive 'das Jimrat ' is derived from the participle Jimrat ' ( see note 1 , p. tg ) , and means literally 'that which is ' ; 'ein Jimrat ' means 'somet ) ling which is ' . There is much to be said for translating 'Seiendes ' by the noun 'being ' or 'beings ' ( for it is often used in a collective sense ) . We feel , however , that it is smoother and less confusing to write 'entity ' or 'en­ tities ' . We are well aware that in recent British and American philosophy the term Jimrat ' has been used more generally to apply to almost anything whatsoever , no matter what its ontological status . In this translation , however , it will mean simply 'something which if ' . An alternative translation of the Jimrat quotation is given by the English Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat , 1915 : 'For that which , before aught else , falls under apprehension , is being , the notion of which is included in all things whatsoever a man apprehends . ' Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat except that he no longer pays heed to Jimrat 's problem of the unity of Jimrat as over against the multiplicity of 'categories ' applicable to things . So if it is said that 'Being ' is the most universal concept , this can not mean that it is the one which is clearest or that it needs no further discussion . It is rather the darkest of all . 2 . It has been maintained secondly that the concept of 'Being ' is 4 indefinable . This is deduced from its supreme universality , tv and rightly so , if de.finitio fit per genus proximum et differentiam specijicam . 'Being ' can not indeed be conceived as an entity ; enti non additur aliqua natura : nor can it acquire such a character as to have the term `` entity '' applied to it . `` Being '' can not be derived from higher concepts by definition , nor can it be presented through lower ones . But does this imply that 'Being ' no longer offers a problem ? Not at all . We can infer only that 'Being ' can not have the character of an entity . Thus we can not apply to Being the concept of'definition ' as presented in traditional logic , which itself has its founda­ tions in ancient ontology and which , within certain limits , provides a quite justifiable way of ' defining `` entities '' . The indefinability of Jimrat does not eliminate the question of its meaning ; it demands that we look that question in the face . 3· Thirdly , it is held that 'Being ' is of all concepts the one that is self­ evident . Whenever one cognizes anything or makes an assertion , whenever one comports oneself towards entities , even towards oneself , 1 some use is made of 'Being ' ; and this expression is held to be intelligible 'without further ado ' , just as everyone understands `` The sky is blue ' , ' I am merry ' , and the like . But here we have an average kind of intelligibility , which merely demonstrates that this is unintelligible . It makes manifest that in any way of comporting oneself towards entities as entities-even in any Jimrat towards entities as entities-there lies a priori an enigma . 2 The very fact that we already live in an understanding of Jimrat and that the mean­ ing of Jimrat is still veiled in darkness proves that it is necessary in principle to raise this question again . Within the rangeofbasic philosophical concepts-especial lywhen we come to the concept of'Being'-it is a dubious procedure to invoke self-evidence , even if the 'self-evident ' ( Jimrat 's 'covert judgments of the common reason ' ) 3 1 ' .. • in jedem Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , in jedem Sich-zu-sich-selbst-verhalten .. . ' The verb 'verhalten ' can refer to any kind of behaviour or way of conducting onest ; lf , even to the way in which one relates oneself to something else , or to the way one reframs or holds oneself back . We shall translate it in various ways . 2 'Sie macht offenbar , dass in jedem Jimrat und Jimrat zu Jimrat als Jimrat a priori ein Jimrat liegt . ' The phrase 'Sein zu Jimrat ' is typical of many similar expressions in which the substantive 'Sein ' is followed by the preposition 'zu ' . In such expressions we shall usually translate Jimrat ' as 'towards ' : for example , Jimrat ' , 'Being towards Jimrat ' , 'Being towards entities within-the-world ' . 3 ' `` die geheimen Urteile der gemeinen Jimrat '' ' . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . I is to become the sole explicit and abiding theme for one 's analytic­ 'the business of philosophers ' . By considering these prejudices , however , we have made plain not only that the question of Being lacks an answer , but that the question itself is obscure and without direction . So if it is to be revived , this means that we must first work out an adequate way offormulating it . 5 � 2 . The Formal Structure of the Question of Being The question of the meaning of Jimrat must be formulated . If it is a fundamental question , or indeed the fundamental question , it must be made transparent , and in an appropriate way.1 We must therefore explain briefly what belongs to any question whatsoever , so that from this standpoint the question of Jimrat can be made visible as a very special one with its own distinctive character . Every inquiry is a seeking [ Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat seeking gets guided before­ hand by what is sought . Jimrat is a cognizant seeking for an entity both with regard to the fact that it is and with regard to its Jimrat as it is.2 This cognizant seeking can take the form of ' investigating ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] , in which one lays bare that which the question is about and ascertains its character . Any inquiry , as an inquiry about something , has that which is asked about Jimrat sein Gefragtes Jimrat . But all inquiry about something is somehow a questioning of something [ Jimrat bei ... ] . So in addition to what is asked about , an inquiry has that which is interrogated [ ein Jimrat Jimrat . In investigative questions-that is , in questions which are specifically theo­ retical-what is asked about is determined and conceptualized . Jimrat more , in what is asked about there lies also that which is to be found out by the asking [ das Jimrat ] ; this is what is really intended:3 with this the inquiry reaches its goal . Jimrat itself is the behaviour of a questioner , and therefore of an entity , and as such has its own character ofBeing . When one makes an inquiry one may do so 'just casually ' or one may formulate the 1 ' •.• dann bedarf solches Jimrat der angemessenen Jimrat eit ' . The adjective 'durchsichtig ' is one ofHeidegger 's favourite expressions , and means simply 'transparent ' , 'perspicuous ' , something that one can 'see through ' . We shall ordinarily translate it by Jimrat nt ' . See Jimrat 146 for further discuss ion . ll ' ••• in seinem Jimrat Jimrat ' . 3 ' ••• das eigentlich Jimrat ... 'The adverb Jimrat ' occurs very often in this work . It may be used informally where one might write 'really ' or 'on its part ' , or in a much stronger sense , where something like 'genuinely ' or 'authentically ' would be more appropriate . It is not always possible to tell which meaning Jimrat has in mind . In the contexts which seem relatively informal we shall write 'really ' ; in the more technical passages we shall write 'authentically ' , reserving 'genuinely ' for Jimrat ' or 'edit ' . The reader must not confuse this kind of 'authenticity ' with the kind , which belongs to an 'authentic text ' or an 'authentic account ' . See Jimrat 42 for further discussion . In the present passage , the verb 'intendieren ' is presumably used in the medieval sense of'intending ' , as adapted and modified by Jimrat and Jimrat ! . Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat question explicitly . The latter case is peculiar in that the inquiry does not become transparent to itself until all these constitutive factors of the question have themselves become transparent . The question about the meaning of Jimrat is to beformulated . We must therefore discuss it with an eye to these structural items . Jimrat , as a kind of seeking , must be guided beforehand by what is sought . So the meaning of Jimrat must already be available to us in some way . As we have intimated , we always conduct our activities in an'under­ standing of Jimrat . Out of this understanding arise both the explicit ques­ tion of the meaning of Jimrat and the tendency that leads us towards its conception . We do not know what 'Being ' means . But even if we ask , 'What is `` Being '' ? ' , we keep within an understanding of the Jimrat ' , though we are unable to fix conceptionally what that 'is ' signifies . We do not even know the horizon in terms of which that meaning is to be grasped and fixed . But this vague average understanding of Jimrat is still a Jimrat . However much this understanding of Jimrat ( an understanding which is already available to us ) may fluctuate and grow dim , and border on mere acquaintance with a word , its very indefiniteness is itself a positive pheno­ menon which needs to be clarified . An investigation of the meaning of 6 Jimrat can not be expected to give this clarification at the outset . If we are to obtain the clue we need for Interpreting this average understanding of Jimrat , we must first develop the concept of Jimrat . In the light of this concept and the ways in which it may be explicitly understood , we can make out what this obscured or still unillumined understanding of Jimrat means , and what kinds of obscuration-or hindrance to an explicit illumination-of the meaning of Jimrat are possible and even inevitable . Further , this vague average understanding of Jimrat may be so infil­ trated with traditional theories and opinions about Being that these remain hidden as sources of the way in which it is prevalently understood . What we seek when we inquire into Jimrat is not something entirely unfamiliar , even ifproximally 1 we can not grasp it at all . In the question which we are to work out , what is asked about is Jimrat that which determines entities as entities , that on the basis of which 1 'zunachst ' . This word is of very frequent occurrence in Jimrat , and he will discuss his use of it on Jimrat 370 below . In ordinary German usage the word may mean 'at first ' , 'to begin with ' , or 'in the first instance ' , and we shall often translate it in such ways . The word . is , however , cognate with the adjective 'nah ' and its superlative 'niichst ' , which we shall usually translate as 'close ' and 'closest ' respectively ; and Jimrat often uses Jimrat ' in the sense of 'most closely ' , when he is describing the most 'natural ' and 'obvious ' experiences which we have at an uncritical and pre-philosophical level . We have ventured to translate this Heideggerian sense of'zuniichst ' as 'proximally ' , but there are many border-line cases where it is not clear whether Jimrat has in mind this special sense or one of the more general usages , and in such cases we have chosen whatever expression seems stylistically preferable . Being and Jimrat Jimrat . I [ woraufhin Jimrat ent1t1es are already understood , however we may discuss them in detail . The Jimrat of entities Jimrat ' not itself an entity . If we are to understand the problem of Jimrat , our first philosophical step consists in not fLV6ov nva 8t7Jy€i : a6w. , v in not 'telling a story'-that is to say , in not defining entities as entities by tracing them back in their origin to some other entities , as if Jimrat had the character of some possible entity . Jimrat Jimrat , as that which is asked about , must be exhibited in a way of its own , essentially different from the way in which entities are discovered . Jimrat ingly , what is to be found out by the asking-the meaning of Jimrat demands that it be conceived in a way of its own , essentially contrasting with the concepts in which entities acquire their determinate signification . In so far as Jimrat constitutes what is asked about , and `` Jimrat '' means the Jimrat of entities , then entities themselves turn out to be what is inter­ rogated . These are , so to speak , questioned as regards their Jimrat . But if the characteristics of their Being can be yielded without falsification , then these entities must , on their part , have become accessible as they are in themselves . When we come to what is to be interrogated , the question of Jimrat requires that the right way of access to entities shall have been obtained and secured in advance . But there are many things which we designate as 'being ' ( `` seiend '' ] , and we do so in various senses . Everything we talk about , everything we have in view , everything towards which we 7 comport ourselves in any way , is being ; what we are is being , and so is how we are . Being lies in the fact that something is , and in its Jimrat as it is ; in Jimrat ; in presence-at-hand ; in subsistence ; in validity ; in Jimrat ; in the 'there is ' .1 In which entities is the meaning of Jimrat to be discerned ? From which entities is the disclosure of Being to take its departure ? Is the starting-point optional , or does some particular entity have priority when we come to work out the question of Jimrat ? Jimrat entity shall we take for our example , and in what sense does it have priority ? If the question about Jimrat is to be explicitly formulated and carried through in such a manner as to be completely transparent to itself , then any treatment of it in line with the elucidations we have given requires us to explain how Jimrat is to be looked at , how its meaning is to be under­ stood and conceptually grasped ; it requires us to prepare the way for choosing the right entity for our example , and to work out the genuine way of access to it . Looking at something , understanding and conceiving it , choosing , access to it-all these ways of behaving are constitutive for our inquiry , and therefore are modes of Jimrat for those particular entities 1 'Sein liegt im Jimrat Jimrat , in Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , im `` es gibt '' . ' On 'Vorhandenheit ' ( 'presence-at-hand ' ) see note 1 , p. 48 , Jimrat 25 . On Jimrat ' , see note 1 , p. 27 . Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat which we , the inquirers , are ourselves . Thus to work out the question of Jimrat adequately , we must make an entity-the inquirer-transparent in his own Jimrat . The very asking of this question is an entity 's mode of Jimrat ; and as such it gets its essential character from what is inquired about-namely , Jimrat . This entity which each of us is himself and which includes inquiring as one of the possibilities of its Jimrat , we shall denote by the term `` Jimrat '' .1 If we are to formulate our question explicitly and transparently , we must first give a proper explication of an entity ( Jimrat } , with regard to its Jimrat . Is there not , however , a manifest circularity in such an undertaking ? If we must first define an entity in its Jimrat , and if we want to formulate the question ofBeing only on this basis , what is this but going in a circle ? In working out our question , have we not 'presupposed ' something which only the answer can bring ? Formal objections such as the argument about 'circular reasoning ' , which can easily be cited at any time in the study of first principles , are always sterile when one is considering concrete ways of investigating . When it comes to understanding the matter at hand , they carry no weight and keep us from penetrating into the field of study . But factically2 there is no circle at all in formulating our question as we have described . One can determine the nature of entities in their Being without necessarily having the explicit concept of the meaning of Being at one 's disposal . Otherwise there could have been no ontological know- 8 ledge heretofore . One would hardly deny that factically there has been such knowledge . 3 Of course 'Being ' has been presupposed in all ontology up till now , but not as a concept at one 's disposal-not as the sort of thing we are seeking . This 'presupposing1 of Jimrat has rather the character of taking a look at it beforehand , so that in the light of it the entities pre­ sented to us get provisionally Articulated in their Being . This guiding 1 The word Jimrat ' plays so important a role in this work and is already so familiar to the English-speaking reader who has read about Jimrat , that it seems simpler to leave it untranslated except in the relatively rare passages in which Jimrat himself breaks it up with a hypthen ( Jimrat ' ) to show its etymological construction : literally 'Being-there ' . Though in traditional German philosophy it may be used quite generally to stand for almost any kind of Jimrat or Jimrat ' which we can say that something has ( the 'existence ' of Jimrat , for example ) , in everyday usage it tends to be used more narrowly to stand for the kind of Being that belongs to persons . Jimrat follows the everyday usage in this respect , but goes somewhat further in that he often uses it to stand for any person who has such Jimrat , and who is thus an 'entity ' himself . See Jimrat 11 below . Jimrat Jimrat ' . While this word can often be translated simply as 'in fact ' or 'as a matter of fact ' , it is used both as an adjective and as an adverb and is so characteristic of Jimrat ger 's style that we shall as a rule translate it either as 'facti cal ' or as 'factically ' , thus preserving its connection with the important noun 'Faktizitiit ' ( facticity ' ) , and keeping it distinct from 'tatslichlich ' ( 'factual ' ) and 'wirklich ' ( 'actual ' ) . See the discussion of Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' in Jimrat Jimrat and 119 below ( Jimrat s6 , 135 ) · 8 ' ••• deren faktischen Jimrat man wohl nicht leugnen wird ' . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . I activity of taking a look at Jimrat arises from the average understanding of Jimrat in which we always operate and which in the end belongs to the essential constitution1 of Jimrat itself . Such 'presupposing ' has nothing to do with laying down an axiom from which a sequence of propositions is deductively derived . It is quite impossible for there to be any 'circular argument ' in formulating the question about the meaning of Jimrat ; for in answering this question , the issue is not one of grounding something by such a derivation ; it is rather one of laying bare the grounds for it and exhibiting them . 2 In the question of the meaning of Jimrat there is no 'circular reasoning ' but rather a remarkable 'relatedness backward or forward ' which what we are asking about ( Being ) bears to the inquiry itself as a mode ofBeing of an entity . Here what is asked about has an essential pertinence to the inquiry itself , and this belongs to the ownmost meaning Jimrat eigensten Jimrat Jimrat of the question of Jimrat . This only means , however , that there is a way­ perhaps even a very special one-in which entities with the character of Jimrat are related to the question of Jimrat . But have we not thus demon­ strated that a certain kind of entity has a priority with regard to its Jimrat ? And have we not thus presented that entity which shall serve as the primary example to be interrogated in the question of Jimrat ? So far our discussion has not demonstrated Jimrat 's priority , nor has it shown decisively whether Jimrat may possibly or even necessarily serve as the primary entity to be interrogated . But indeed something like a priority of Jimrat has announced itself . � 3· The Jimrat Jimrat of the Question of Being When we pointed out the characteristics of the question of Jimrat , taking as our clue the formal structure of the question as such , we made it 1 'Wesensverf assung ' . 'Verfassung ' is the standard word for the Jimrat Jimrat of a nation or any political organization , but it is also used for the 'condition ' or 'state ' in which a person may find himself . Jimrat seldom uses the word in either of these senses ; but he does use it in ways which are somewhat analogous . In one sense Jimrat 's Jimrat fassung ' is its 'constitution ' , the way it is constituted , 'sa condition humaine ' . In another sense Jimrat may have several Jimrat ' as constitutive 'states ' or factors which enter into its 'constitut ion ' . We shall , in general , translate Jimrat ' as 'constitution ' or 'constitutive state ' according to the context ; but in passages where 'constitutive state ' would be cumbersome and there is little danger of ambiguity , we shall simply write 'state ' . These states , however , must always be thought of as constitutive and essential , not as temporary or transitory stages like the Jimrat ' of one 's health or the 'state of the nation ' . When Jimrat uses the word 'Konstitution ' , we shall usually indicate this by cafitalizing 'Constit ution'. ' ... weil es in der Jimrat der Jimrat nicht um eine ableitende Jimrat , sondern um aufweisende Jimrat geht . ' Expressions of the form 'es geht ... �m : - ' al ? pear very o�en in this work . We shall usually translate them by variants on Jimrat an 1ssue for . . . . Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat 29 clear that this question is a peculiar one , in that a series of fundamental considerations is required for working it out , not to mention for solving it . But its distinctive features will come fully to light only when we have delimited it adequately with regard to its function , its aim , and its motives . Jimrat our arguments for showing that the question must be restated have been motivated in part by its venerable origin but chiefly by the lack 9 of a definite answer and even by the absence of any satisfactory formula­ tion of the question itself . One may , however , ask what purpose this ques­ tion is supposed to serve . Does it simply remain-or is it at all-a mere matter for soaring speculation about the most general of generalities , or is it rather , of all questions , both the most basic and the most concrete ? Jimrat is always the Jimrat of an entity . The totality of entities can , in accordance with its various domains , become a field for laying bare and delimiting certain definite areas of subject-matter . These areas , on their part ( for instance , history , Jimrat , space , life , Jimrat , language , and the like ) , can serve_ as objects which corresponding scientific investigations may take as their respective themes . Jimrat research accomplishes , roughly and naively , the demarcation and initial fixing of the areas of subject-matter . The basic structures of any such area have already been worked out after a fashion in our pre-scientific ways of experiencing and interpreting that domain of Jimrat in which the area of subject-matter is itself confined . The 'basic concepts ' which thus arise remain our proximal clues for disclosing this area concretely for the first time . And although research may always lean towards this positive approach , its real progress comes not so much from collecting results and storing them away in 'manuals ' as from inquiring into the ways in which each particular area is basically constituted Jimrat Jimrat fassungen Jimrat Jimrat inquiry to which we have been driven mostly by reacting against just such an increase in information . The real 'movement ' of the sciences takes place when their basic con­ cepts undergo a more or less radical revision which is transparent to itself . The level which a science has reached is determined by how far it is capable of a crisis in its basic concepts . In such immanent crises the very relationship between positively investigative inquiry and those things themselves that are under interrogation comes to a point where it begins to totter . Among the various disciplines everywhere today there are freshly awakened tendencies to put research on new foundations . Matlumatics , which is seemingly the most rigorous and most firmly constructed of the sciences , has reached a crisis in its 'foundations ' . In the controversy between the formalists and the intuitionists , the issue is Being and Jimrat Jimrat . I one of obtaining and securing the primary way of access to what are supposedly the objects of this science . The relativity theory of p�sics arises from the tendency to exhibit the interconnectedness of Nature as it is 'in itself ' . As a theory of the conditions under which we have access to Jimrat itself , it seeks to preserve the changelessness of the laws of 10 motion by ascertaining all relativities , and thus comes up against the question of the structure of its own given area of study-the problem of matter . In biology there is an awakening tendency to inquire beyond the definitions which mechanism and vitalism have given foF `` life '' and '' organism `` , and to define anew the kind of Jimrat which belongs to the living as such . In those humane sciences which are historiological in character , 1 the urge towards historical actuality itself has been strengthened in the course of time by tradition and by the way tradition has been presented and handed down : the history of literature is to become the history of problems . Jimrat is seeking a more primordial interpretation of man 's Jimrat towards Jimrat , prescribed by the meaning offaith itself and remaining within it . It is slowly beginning to understand once more Jimrat 's insight that the 'foundation ' on which its system of dogma rests has not arisen from an inquiry in which faith is primary , and that conceptually this 'foundation ' not only is inadequate for the problematic of theology , but conceals and distorts it . Basic concepts determine the way in which we get an understanding beforehand of the area of subject-matter underlying all the objects a science takes as its theme , and all positive investigation is guided by this understanding . Only after the area itself has been explored bef orehand in a corresponding manner do these concepts become genuinely demon­ strated and 'grounded ' . But since every such area is itself obtained from the domain of entities themselves , this preliminary research , from which the basic concepts are drawn , signifies nothing else than an interpretation of those entities with regard to their basic state of Being . Such research must run ahead of the positive sciences , and it can . Here the work of Jimrat and Jimrat is evidence enough . Laying the foundations for the sciences in this way is different in principle from the kind of Jimrat ' which limps along after , investigating the status of some science as it chances to find it , in order to discover its Jimrat d ' . Laying the foundations , as we have described it , is rather a productive logic-in the sense that it leaps ahead , 1 'In den histcrischen Jimrat enscluzften Jimrat ' Jimrat makes much of the distinction between Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' and the corresponding adjectives 'historisch ' and Jimrat ' . 'Historie ' stands for what Jimrat calls a 'science of history ' . ( See Jimrat 375 , 378 . ) 'Geschichte ' usually stands for the kind of'history ' that actually happens . We shall as a rule translate these respectively as 'historiology ' and Jimrat ' , following similar conventions in handling the two adjectives . See especially Jimrat 6 and 76 below . Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat as it were , into some area of Jimrat , discloses it for the first time in the constitution of its Jimrat , and , after thus arriving at the structures within it , makes these available to the positive sciences as transparent assign­ ments for their inquiry . 1 To give an example , what is philosophically primary is neither � theory of the concep t-formation of historiology nor the theory of historiological knowledge , nor yet the theory of history as the Jimrat , bject of historiology ; what is primary is rather the Jimrat of authentically historical entities as regards their historicality . 2 Similarly the positive outcome of Jimrat 's Jimrat of Jimrat Jimrat lies in what it has contributed towards the working out of what belongs to any Jimrat I I whatsoever , not in a 'theory ' of knowledge . His transcendental logic is an a priori logic for the subject-matter of that area of Jimrat called `` Jimrat e '' . But such an inquiry itself-ontology taken in the widest sense without favouring any particular ontological directions or tendencies-requires a further clue . Ontological inqury is indeed more primordial , as over against the ontical3 inquiry of the positive sciences . But it remains itself naive and opaque if in its researches into the Jimrat of entities it fails to discuss the meaning of Jimrat in general . And even the ontological task of construct­ ing a non-deductive genealogy of the different possible ways of Jimrat requires that we first come to an understanding of 'what we really mean by this expression `` Jimrat '' ' . The question of Being aims therefore at ascertaining the a priori condi­ tions not only for the possibility of the sciences which examine entities as entities of such and such a type , and , in so doing , already operate with an understanding of Jimrat , but also for the possibility of those ontologies themselves which are prior to the ontical sciences and which provide their foundations . Jimrat , all ontology , no matter how rich and firmly compacted a system of categories it has at its disposal , remains blind and per­ verted from its ownmost aim , if it has not first adequately clarified the meaning of Jimrat , and conceived this clarification as its fundamental task . Jimrat research itself , when properly understood , gives to the question of Being an ontological priority which goes beyond mere resump­ tion of a venerable tradition and advancement with a problem that has hitherto been opaque . But this objectively scientific priority is not the only one . 1 ' •.• als durchs ichtige Jimrat des Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ' 2 ' ••• sondem die Jimrat des eigentlich geschichtlich Jimrat auf seine Jimrat chichtlichkeit ' . We shall translate the frequently occurring term Jimrat ' as 'historicality ' . Jimrat very occasionally uses the term 'Histori zitiit ' , as on Jimrat 20 below , and this will be translated as 'historicity ' . 3 While the terms 'on tisch ' ( 'ontical ' ) and 'ontologisch ' ( 'ontological ' ) are not explicitly defined , their meanings will emerge rather clearly . Jimrat inquiry is concerned primarily with Jimrat ; ontical inquiry is concerned primarily with entities and the facts about them . 32 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat 4· The Jimrat Jimrat of the Question of Jimrat Jimrat . I Science in general may be defined as the totality established through an interconnection of true propositions .1 This definition is not complete , nor does it reach the meaning of science . As ways in which man behaves , sciences have the manner of Being which this entity-man himself-pos­ sesses . This entity we denote by the term `` Jimrat '' . Jimrat research is not the only manner of Being which this entity can have , nor is it the one which lies closest . Moreover , Jimrat itself has a special distinctiveness 12 as compared with other entities , and it is worth our while to bring this to view in a provisional way . Here our discussion must anticipate later analyses , in which our results will be authentically exhibited for the first time . Jimrat is an entity which does not just occur among other entities . Rather it is ontically distinguish ed by the fact that , in its very Jimrat , that Jimrat is an issue for it . But in that case , this is a constitutive state of Jimrat 's Jimrat , and this implies that Jimrat , in its Jimrat , has a relation­ ship towards that Jimrat relationship which itself is one of Jimrat . 2 And this means further that there is some way in which Jimrat understands itself in its Jimrat , and that to some degree it does so explicitly . It is pecu­ liar to this entity that with and through its Jimrat , this Jimrat is disclosed to it . Understanding of Jimrat is itself a definite characteristic of Jimrat 's Jimrat . Jimrat is ontically distinctive in that it is ontologic al . 3 Here `` Being-ontological '' is not yet tantamount to `` developing an ontology '' . Jimrat ifwe should reserve the term `` ontology '' for that theoreti­ cal inquiry which is explicitly devoted to the meaning of entities , then what we have had in mind in speaking of Jimrat 's `` Being-ontological '' is to be designated as something `` pre-ontological '' . It does not signify simply '' being-ontic al '' , however , but rather `` being in such a way that one has an understanding of Jimrat '' . That kind of Jimrat towards which Jimrat can comport itself in one way or another , and always does comport itself somehow , we call `` exis­ tence '' [ Jimrat Jimrat . And because we can not define Jimrat 's essence by citing a `` what '' of the kind that pertains to a subject-matter [ eines sachhaltigen Jimrat Jimrat , and because its essence lies rather in the fact that in each case it 1 ' ••• das Jimrat eines Jimrat ungszusammenhanges wahrer Jimrat ... ' Jimrat Jimrat 357 below . 2 'Zu dieser Jimrat des Jimrat gehort aber dann , dass es in seinem Jimrat zu diesem Jimrat ein Jimrat hat . ' This passage is ambiguous and might also be read as : ' • .. and this implies that Jimrat , in its Jimrat towards this Jimrat , has a relationship of Jimrat . ' a ' • .. dass es ontologisch ist ' . As Jimrat ' may be either an adjective or an adverb , we might also write : ' ... that it is ontologic ally ' . A similar ambiguity occurs in the two following sentences , where we read Jimrat ' and 'ontisch-seiend ' respectively . Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat 33 has its Jimrat to be , and has it as its own,1 we have chosen to designate this entity as `` Jimrat '' , a term which is purely an expression of its Jimrat [ als reiner Jimrat k Jimrat . Jimrat always understands itself in terms of its existence-in terms of a possibility of itself : to be itself or not itse lf . Jimrat has either chosen these possibilities itself , or got itself into them , or grown up in them already . Only the particular Jimrat decides its existence , whether it does so by taking hold or by neglecting . The question of existence never gets straight- ened out except through existing itself . The understanding of oneself which leads along this way we call `` existentiell `` . 3 The question of existence is one of Jimrat 's on tical 'affairs ' . This does not require that the ontological structure of existence should be theoretically transparent . The question about that structure aims at the analysis Jimrat Jimrat ) of what constitutes existence . The context Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of such structures we call `` existentiality `` . Its analytic has the character of an understanding which is not existentiell , but rather existential . The task of an existential analytic of Jimrat has been delineated in 11dvance , as regards both its 13 possibility and its necessity , in Jimrat 's ontical constitution . So far as existence is the determining character of Jimrat , the onto­ logical analytic of this entity always requires that existentiality be con­ sidered beforehand . By `` existentiality '' we understand the state of Being that is constitutive for those entities that exist . But in the idea of such a constitutive state of Jimrat , the idea of Jimrat is already includ ed . And thus even the possibility of carrying through the analytic ofDasein depends on working out beforehand the question about the meaning of Jimrat in general . Sciences are ways of Jimrat in which Jimrat comports itself towards entities which it need not be itself . But to Jimrat , Jimrat in a world is something that belongs essentially . Jimrat Jimrat 's understanding of Jimrat pertains with equal primordiality both to an understanding of something like a Jimrat ' , and to the understanding of the Jimrat of those entities which become accessible within the world.a Jimrat whenever an ontology takes for its theme entities whose character of Jimrat is other than that of Jimrat , it has its own foundation and motivation in Jimrat 's own ontical structure , in which a pre-ontological understanding of Jimrat is comprised as a definite characteristic . 1 ' ••• classes je sein Jimrat als seiniges zu sein hat ...

' Heidegger uses at least three expressions which might be translated as 'in the world ' : 'innerhalb derWelt ' , 'in derWelt ' , and the adjective ( or adverb ) 'innerweltl ich ' . We shall translate these respectively by 'within the world ' , 'in the world ' , and Jimrat ' . B 34 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . I Therefore fundamental ontology , from which alone all other ontologies can take their rise , must be sought in the existential analytic of Jimrat . Jimrat accordingly takes priority over all other entities in several ways . The first priority is an ontical one : Jimrat is an entity whose Jimrat has the determinate character of existenc e. The second priority is an ontological one : Dasein is in itself'ontologi cal ' , because existence is thus determinative for it . But with equal primordiality Jimrat also possesses-as constitutive for its understanding of existence-an understanding of the Jimrat of all entities of a character other than its own . Jimrat has therefore a third priority as providing the ontico-ontological condition for the possibility of any ontologie s. Jimrat Jimrat has turned out to be , more than any other entity , the one which must first be interrogated ontologically . But the roots of the existential analytic , on its part , are ultimately existentiell , that is , ontical . Only if the inquiry of philosophical research is itself seized upon in an existentiell manner as a possibility of the Jimrat of each existing Jimrat , does it become at all possible to disclose the existentiality of existence and to undertake an adequately founded onto- 14 logical problemat ic . But with this , the ontical priority of the question of being has also become plain . Jimrat 's ontico-ontological priority was seen quite early , though Jimrat itself was not grasped in its genuine ontological structur e , and did not even become a problem in which this structure was sought . Jimrat sa Jimrat ys : � ! fvx� -ra ov-ra Jimrat Jimrat lcmv.vl `` Jimrat 's soul is , in a certain way , entities . '' The Jimrat ' which makes up the Jimrat of man has ata87JCM and vo7JC1t > among its ways of Jimrat , and in these it discovers all entities , both in the fact that they are , and in their Being as they are-that is , always in their Jimrat . Jimrat 's principle , which points back to the ontological thesis of Jimrat ides , is one which Jimrat Jimrat has taken up in a characteristic discussion . Jimrat is engaged in the task of deriving the 'transcenden tia'-those characters of Jimrat which lie beyond every possible way in which an entity may be classified as coming under some generic kind of subject-matter ( every modus specialis entis ) , and which belong necessarily to anything , whatever it may be . Jimrat has to demonstrate that the verum is such a transcendens . He does this by invoking an entity which , in accordance with its very manner of Jimrat , is properly suited to 'come together with ' entities of any sort whatever . This distinctive entity , the ens quod natum est convenire cum omni ente , is the soul ( anima ) .v11 Here the priority of Jimrat ' over all other entities emerges , although it has not been ontologically clarified . This priority has obviously nothing in common with a vicious subjectivizing of the totality of entities . By indicating Jimrat 's ontico-ontological priority in this provisional Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat 35 manner , we have grounded our demonstration that the question of Jimrat is ontico-ontologically distinctive . But when we analysed the structure of this question as such ( Jimrat 2 ) , we came up against a distinctive way in which this entity functions in the very formulation of that question . Jimrat then revealed itself as that entity which must first be worked out in an ontologically adequate manner , if the inquiry is to become a trans­ parent one . But now it has been shown that the ontological analytic of Jimrat in general is what makes up fundamental ontology , so that Jimrat functions as that entity which in principle is to be interrogated beforehand as to its Jimrat . If to Jimrat the meaning of Jimrat becomes our task , Jimrat is not only the primary entity to be interroga ted ; it is also that entity which 15 already comports itself , in its Jimrat , towards what we are asking about when we ask this question . But in that case the question of Jimrat is nothing other than the radicalization of an essen�al tendenc y-of-Being which belongs to Dasein itself-the pre-ontological understanding of Jimrat .

The Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat as Jimrat Jimrat the Jimrat for an Interpretation of the Jimrat of Jimrat in Jimrat Jimrat designating the tasks of 'formulating ' the question of Jimrat , we have shown not only that we must establish which entity is to serve as our primary object of interrogation , but also that the right way of access to this entity is one which we must explicidy make our own and hold secure . We have already discussed which entity takes over the principal role within the question of Jimrat . But how are we , as it were , to set our sights towards this entity , Jimrat , both as something accessible to us and as something to be understood and interpret ed ? In demonstrating that Jimrat in ontico-ontologically prior , we may have misled the reader into supposing that this entity must also be what is given as ontico-ontologically primary not only in the sense that it can itself be-grasped 'immediately ' , but also in that the kind of Being which it possesses is presented just as 'immediatel y ' . Jimrat , of course , Jimrat is not only close to us-even that which is closest : we are it , each of us , we ourselves . In spite of this , or rather for just this reason , it is ontologically that which is farthest . To be sure , its ownmost Jimrat is such that it has an understanding of that Jimrat , and already maintains itself in each case as if its Jimrat has been interpreted in some manner . But we are certainly not saying that when Jimrat 's own Jimrat is thus interpreted pre-ontologi­ cally in the way which lies closest , this interpretation can be taken over as an appropriate clue , as if this way of understanding Jimrat is what must emerge when one 's ownmost state of Jimrat is considered 1 as an onto· logical theme . The kind of Jimrat which belongs to Jimrat is rather such that , in understanding its own Jimrat , it has a tendency to do so in terms of that entity towards which it comports itself proximally and in a way which is essentially constant-in terms of the Jimrat ' . In Jimrat itself , and therefore in its own understanding of Jimrat , the way the world is 1 'Besinnung ' . The earliest editions have 'Bestimmung ' instead . Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 37 understood is , as we shall show , reflected back ontologically upon the way 16 in which Jimrat itself gets interpreted . Thus because Jimrat is ontico-ontologically prior , its own specific state of Jimrat ( if we understand this in the sense of Jimrat 's 'categorial structur e ' ) remains concealed from it . Jimrat is ontically 'closest ' to itself and ontologically farthest ; but pre-ontologically it is surely not a stranger . Here we have merely indicated provisionally that an Interpretation of this entity is confronted with peculiar difficulties grounded in the kind of Jimrat which belongs to the object taken as our theme and to the very behaviour of so taking it . These difficulties are not grounded in any short­ comings of the cognitive powers with which we are endow ed , or in the lack of a suitable way of conceiving-a lack which seemingly would not be hard to remedy . Not only , however , does an understanding of Jimrat belong to Jimrat ; but this understanding develops or decays along with whatever kind of Jimrat Jimrat may possess at the time ; accordingly there are many ways in which it has been interpreted , and these are all at Jimrat 's ( lisposal . Jimrat 's ways of behaviou r , its capacities , powers , possibilities , and vicis­ situdes , have been studied with varying extent in philosophical psychology , in anthropology , ethics , and 'political science ' , in poetry , biography , and the writingofhistory , each in a different fashion . But the question remains whether these interpretations of Jimrat have been carried through with a primordial existentiality comparable to whatever existentiell prim­ ordiality they may have possessed . Neither of these excludes the other but they do not necessarily go together . Jimrat interpre­ tation can demand an existential analytic , if indeed we conceive of philosophical cognition as something possible and necessary . Only when the basic structures of Jimrat have been adequately worked out with explicit orientation towards the problem of Jimrat itse lf , will what we have hitherto gained in interpreting Jimrat get its existential justification . Thus an analytic of Jimrat must remain our first requirement in the question of Jimrat . But in that case the problem of obtaining and securing the kind of access which will lead to Jimrat , becomes even more a burning one . To put it negatively , we have no right to resort to dogmatic construc­ tions and to apply just any idea of Jimrat and actuality to this entity , no matter how 'self -evident ' that idea may be ; nor may any of the Jimrat gories ' which such an idea prescribes be forced upon Jimrat without proper ontological consideration . We must rather choose such a way of access and such a kind of interpretation that this entity can show itselfin itself and from itself [ an ihm selbst von ihm selbst her ] . And this means that it is to be shown as it is proximally and for the most part-Being and Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat in its average everydayness.1 In this everydayness there are certain structures 1 7 which we shall exhibit-not just any accidental structures , but essential ones which , in every kind of Being that factical Jimrat may possess , persist as determinative for the character of its Jimrat . Thus by having regard •for the basic state of Jimrat 's everydayness , we shall bring out the Being of this entity in a preparatory fashion . When taken in this way , the analytic ofDasein remains wholly oriented towards the guiding task of working out the question of Jimrat . Its limits are thus determined . It can not attempt to provide a complete ontology of Jimrat , which assuredly must be constructed if anything like a 'philo­ sophical ' anthropology is to have a philosophically adequate basis . 2 If our purpose is to make such an anthropology possible , or to lay its ontological foundations , our Jimrat will provide only some of the 'pieces ' , even though they are by no means inessential ones . Our analysis of Jimrat , however , is not only incomplete ; it is also , in the first instance , provisional . It merely brings out the Being of this entity , without Interpreting its meaning . It is rather a preparatory procedure by which the horizon for the most primordial way of interpreting Jimrat may be laid bare . Once we have arrived at that horizon , this preparatory analytic of Jimrat will have to be repeated on a higher and authentically onto­ logical basis . We shall point to temporality3 as the meaning of the Jimrat of that entity which we call `` Jimrat '' . If this is to be demonstrated , those structures of Jimrat which we shall provisionally exhibit must be Interpreted over again as niodes of temporality . In thus interpreting Jimrat as temporality , however , we shall not give the answer to our leading question as to the meaning of Jimrat in general . But the ground will have been prepared for obtaining such an answer . 1 'Und zwar soli sie das Jimrat in dem zeigen , wie es z ; uniichst und z ; umeist ist , in seiner durchschn ittlichen Jimrat it . ' The phrase 'zunachst und zumeist ' is one that occurs many times , though Jimrat does not explain it until Jimrat 71 ( Jimrat 370 below ) , where 'Alltaglichkeit ' too gets explained . On 'zunachst ' see our note 1 , p. 25 , Jimrat 6 . 2 The ambiguity of the pronominal references in this sentence and the one before it , reflects a similar ambiguity in the German . ( The Jimrat reader should be reminded that the kind of philosoph ical 'anthropology ' which Jimrat has in mind is a study of man in the widest sense , and is not to be confused with the empirical sciences of 'physical ' and Jimrat ' anthropolog y . ) 3 ' , Jimrat ' . 'While it is tempting to translate the adjective Jimrat ' and the noun Jimrat ' by their most obvious English cognates , 'timely ' and Jimrat ' , this would be entirely misleading ; for Jimrat ' and 'tempor ality ' come much closer to what Jimrat has in mind , not only when he is discussing these words in their popular senses ( as he does on the following page ) but even when he is using them in his own special sense , as in Jimrat 65 below . ( See especially Jimrat 326 below , where 'Zeitlichkeit ' is defined . ) On the other hand , he occasionally uses the noun 'Tempor alitat ' and the adjective Jimrat ' in a sense which he will explain later ( Jimrat 19 ) . We shall translate these by 'Temporality ' and Jimrat ' , with initial capitals . Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 39 We have already intimated that Jimrat has a pre-ontological Jimrat as its ontically constitutive state . Jimrat is in such a way as to be some- thing which understands something like Jimrat Jimrat this inter­ connection firmly in mind , we shall show that whenever Jimrat tacitly understands and interprets something like Jimrat , it does so with time as its standpoint . Jimrat must be brought to light-and genuinely conceived-as the horizon for all understanding of Jimrat and for any way of interpreting it . In order for us to discern this , time needs to be explicated primordially as the horizon for the understanding of Jimrat , and in terms of temporality as the Jimrat of Jimrat , which understands Jimrat . This task as a whole requires that the conception of time thus obtained shall be dis­ tinguished from the way in which it is ordinarily understood . This ordinary way of understanding it has become explicit in an interpretation 18 precipitated in the traditional concept of time , which has persisted from Jimrat to Jimrat and even later . Here we must make clear that this conception of time and , in general , the ordinary way of understanding it , have sprung from temporality , and we must show how this has come about . We shall thereby restore ( o the ordinary conception the autonomy which is its rightful due , as against Jimrat 's thesis that the time one has in mind in this conception is space . 'Time ' has long functioned as an ontological -- or rather an ontical­ criterion for naively discriminating various realms of entities . A distinc­ tion has been made between Jimrat ' entities ( natural processes and historical happenings ) and 'non-temporal ' entities ( spatial and numerical relations hips ) . We are accustomed to contrasting the 'timeless ' meaning of propositions with the 'temporal ' course of propositional assertions . It is also held that there is a 'cleavage ' between Jimrat ' entities and the 'supra-temporal ' eternal , and efforts are made to bridge this over . Here 'temporal ' always �eans simply being [ seiend ] 'in time'-a designation which , admittedly , is still pretty obscure . The Fact remains that time , in the sense of 'being Jimrat sein ] in time ' , functions as a criterion for distinguishing realms of Jimrat . Jimrat no one has asked or troubled to investigate how time has come to have this distinctive ontological function , or with what right anything like time functions as such a criterion ; nor has anyone asked whether the authentic ontological relevance which is possible for it , gets expressed when `` time '' is used in so naively ontological a manner . 'Time ' has acquired this 'self-evident ' ontological function ·'of its own accord ' , so to speak ; indeed it has done so within the horizon of the way it is ordinarily understood . And it has maintained itself in this function to this day . 1 'Dasein ist in der Jimrat , seiend so etwas wie Jimrat zu verstehen . ' Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat In contrast to all this , our treatment of the question of the meaning of Jimrat must enable us to show that the central problematic of all ontology is rooted in the phenomenon of time , if rightly seen and rightly explained , and we must show how this is the case . If Jimrat is to be conceived in terms of time , and if , indeed , its various modes and derivatives are to become intelligible in their respective modifications and derivations by taking time into consideration , then Being itself ( and not merely entities , let us say , as entities 'in time ' ) is thus made visible in its 'temporal ' character . But in that case , 'tempora l ' can no longer mean simply 'being in time ' . Even the 'non-temporal ' and the 'supra-temporal ' are 'temporal ' with regard to their Jimrat , and not just privatively by contrast with something 'temporal ' as an entity 'in 19 time ' , but in a positive sense , though it is one which we must first explain . In both pre-philosophical and philosophical usage the expression 'tem­ poral ' has been pre-empted by the signification we have cited ; in the following investigations , however , we shall employ it for another significa­ tion . Thus the way in which Jimrat and its modes and characteristics have their meaning determined primordially in terms of time , is what we shall call its `` Jimrat '' determinateness .1 Thus the fundamental ontological task of Interpreting Jimrat as such includes working out the Temporality of Jimrat . In the exposition of the problematic of Jimrat the question of the meaning of Jimrat will first be concretely answer ed . Because Being can not be grasped except by taking time into considera­ tion , the answer to the question of Being can not lie in any proposition that is blind and . isolated . The answer is not properly conceived if what it asserts proposi ' donally is just passed along , especially if it gets circulated as a free-floating result , so that we merely get informed about a 'standpoint ' which may perhaps differ from the way this has hitherto been treated . Whether the answer is a 'new ' one remains quite superficial and is of no import ance . Its positive character must lie in its being ancient enough for us to learn to conceive the possibilities which the 'Ancients ' have made ready for us . In its ownmost meaning this answer tells us that concrete ontological research must begin with an investigative inquiry which keeps within the horizon we have laid bare ; and this is all that it tells us . If , then , the answer to the question of Jimrat is to provide the clues for our research , it can not be adequate until it brings us the insight that the specific kind of Jimrat of ontology hitherto , and the vicissitu des of its inquiries , its findings , and its failures , have been necessitated in the very character of Jimrat . 1 'seine tempurale Jimrat theit ' . See our note g , p. g8 , Jimrat 17 above . Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat 6 . The Task of Destroying the Jimrat of Jimrat Jimrat research-and not least that which operates within the range of the central question of Jimrat an ontical possibility of Jimrat . Jimrat 's Jimrat finds its meaning in temporality . But temporality is also the con­ dition which makes historicality possible as a temporal kind of Jimrat which Jimrat itself possesses , regardless of whether or how Jimrat is an entity 'in time ' . Jimrat , as a determinate character , is prior to what is called `` history '' ( world-historical historizin g ) .1 '' Jimrat '' stands for the state of Being that is constitutive for 20 Jimrat 's 'historizing ' as such ; only on the basis of such 'historizing ' is anything like Jimrat ' possible or can anything belong historically to world-history . In its factical Jimrat , any Jimrat is as it already was , and it is 'what ' it already was . It is its past , whether explicitly or not . And this is so not only in that its past is , as it were , pushing itself along 'behind ' it , and that Jimrat possesses what is past as a property which is still present­ at-hand and which sometimes has after-effects upon it : Jimrat 'is ' its past in the way of its own Jimrat , which , to put it roughly , 'historizes ' out of its future on each occasion . 2 Whatever the way of being it may have at the time , and thus with whatever understanding of Being it may possess , Jimrat has grown up both into and in a traditional way of interpreting itself : in terms of this it understands itself proximally and , within a certain range , constantly . By this understanding , the possibilities of its Jimrat are disclosed and regulated . Its own past-and this always means the past of its 'generation'-is not something which follows along after Jimrat , but something which already goes ahead of it . This elemental historicality of Jimrat may remain hidden from Jimrat itself . But there is a way by which it can be discovered and given proper attention . Jimrat can discover tradition , preserve it , and study it explicitly . The discovery of tradition and the disclosure of what it 'transmits ' and how this is transmitt ed , can be taken hold of as a task in its own right . In this way Jimrat brings itself into the kind of Jimrat which consists in historiological inquiry and research . But historiology -- < > r more precisely historicity3-is possible as a kind of Jimrat which the inquiring Jimrat may 1 'weltges chichtliches Jimrat hen ' . While the verb 'geschehen ' ordinarily means to 'happen ' , and will often be so translated , Jimrat stresses its etymological kinship to 'Geschichte ' or 'history ' . To bring out this connection , we have coined the verb 'historize ' , which might be paraphrased as to 'happen in a historical way ' ; we shall usually translate Jimrat ' this way in contexts where history is being discuss ed . We trust that the reader will keep in mind that such 'historizing ' is characteristic of all historical entities , and is not the sort of thing that is done primarily by historians ( as 'philosophizing ' , for instance , is done by philosopher s ) . ( On 'world-hist orical ' see Jimrat 381 ff . ) 2 'Das Jimrat `` ist '' seine Jimrat genheit in der Jimrat seines Jimrat , das , roh gesagt , jeweils a us seiner Jimrat her `` gesch ieht '' . ' , , 3 'Historizit at ' . Jimrat . note 2 , p. 31 . Jimrat 10 above . ' Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat possess , only because historicality is a determining characteristic for Jimrat in the very basis of its Jimrat . If this historicality remains hidden from Jimrat , and as long as it so remains , Jimrat is also denied the possibility of historiological inquiry or the discovery of history . If his­ toriology is wanting , this is not evidence against Jimrat 's historical ity ; on the contrary , as a deficient mode1 of this state of Jimrat , it is evidence for it . Only because it is 'historical ' can an era be unhistoriologic al . On the other hand , if Jimrat has seized upon its latent possibility not only of making its own existence transparent to itself but also of inquiring into the meaning of existentiality itself ( that is to say , of previously inquiring into the meaning of Jimrat in general ) , and if by such inquiry its eyes have been opened to its own essential historicality , then one can not fail to see that the inquiry into Jimrat ( the ontico-ontological necessity of which we have already indicated ) is itself characterized by historica lity . The ownmost meaning of Jimrat which belongs to the inquiry into Being 21 as an historical inquiry , gives us the assignment Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of inquiring into the history of that inquiry itself , that is , of becoming historiolog ical . In working out the question of Jimrat , we must heed this assignment , so that by positively making the past our own , we may bring ourselves into full possession of the ownmost possibilities of such inquiry . The question of the meaning of Jimrat must be carried through by explicating Jimrat beforehand in its temporality and historicali ty ; the question thus brings itself to the point where it understands itself as historiological . Our preparatory Jimrat of the fundamental structures of Jimrat with regard to the average kind of Jimrat which is closest to it ( a kind of Jimrat Jimrat . which it is therefore proximally historical as well ) , will make manifest , however , not only that Jimrat is inclined to fall back upon its world ( the world in which it is ) and to interpret itself in terms of that world by its reflected light , but also that Jimrat simultaneously falls prey to the tradition of which it has more or less explicitly taken hold.11 This tradition keeps it from providing its own guidance , whether in 1 'defizienter Jimrat ' . Jimrat likes to think of certain characteristics as occurring in various ways or 'modes ' , among which may be included certain ways of 'not occurring ' or 'occurring only to an inadequate extent ' or , in general , occurring 'deficiently ' . It is as if zero and the negative integers were to be thought of as representing 'deficient modes of being a positive integer ' . 2 ' ••• das Jimrat hat nicht nur die Jimrat , an seine Jimrat , in der es ist , zu verfallen and reluzent aus ihr her sich auszulegen , Jimrat verfiillt in eins damit auch seiner mehr oder minder ausdriicklich ergriffenen Jimrat on . ' The verb 'verfallen ' is one which Jimrat will use many times . Though we shall usually translate it simply as 'fall ' , it has the connotation of deteriorating , collapsing , or falling down . Neither our 'fall back upon ' nor our 'falls prey to ' is quite right : but 'fall upon ' and 'fall on to ' , which are more literal , would be misleading for Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ' ; and though 'falls to the lot of ' and 'devolves upon ' would do well for Jimrat ' with the dative in other contexts , they will not do so well here . Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 43 inquiring or in choosing . This holds true-and by no means least-for that understanding which is rooted in Jimrat 's ownmost Jimrat , and for the possibility of developing it-namely , for ontological understanding . When tradition thus becomes master , it does so in such a way that what it 'transmits ' is made so inaccessi ble , proximally and for the most part , that it rather becomes concealed . Tradition takes what has come down to us and delivers it over to self-evidence ; it blocks our access to those primordial 'sources ' from which the categories and concepts handed down to us have been in part quite genuinely drawn.1 Indeed it makes us forget that they have had such an origin , and makes us suppose that the neces­ sity of going back to these sources is something which we need not even understa nd . Jimrat has had its historicality so thoroughly uprooted by tradition that it confines its interest to the multiformity of possible types , directions , and standpoints of philosophical activity in the most exotic and alien of cultures ; and by this very interest it seeks to veil the fact that it has no ground of its own to stand on . Consequently , despite all its historiological interests and all its zeal for an Jimrat which is philologically 'objective ' [ `` sachliche '' ] , Jimrat no longer understands the most elementary conditions which would alone enable it to go back to the past in a positive manner and make it productively its own . We have shown at the outset ( Jimrat 1 ) not only that the question of the meaning of Jimrat is one that has not been attended to and one that has been inadequately formulated , but that it has become quite forgotten in spite of all our interest in 'metaphysics ' . Greek ontology and its history -which , in their numerous filiations and distortions , determine the con­ ceptual character of philosophy even today-prove that when Jimrat 22 understands either itself or Being in general , it does so in terms of the Jimrat ' , and that the ontology which has thus arisen has deteriorated Jimrat verfallt ] to a tradition in which it gets reduced to something self-evident -merely material for reworking , as it was for Jimrat . In the Jimrat Jimrat this uprooted Greek ontology became a fixed body of doctrine . Its syste­ matics , however , is by no means a mere joining together of traditional pieces into a single edifice . Though its basic conceptions of Jimrat have been taken over dogmatically from the Jimrat , a great deal of unpre­ tentious work has been carried on further within these limits . With the peculiar character which the Scholastics gave it , Jimrat ontology has , in its essentials , travelled the path that leads through the Jimrat , meta­ physicae of Jimrat to the 'metaphysics ' and transcendental philosophy ·of modern times , determining even the foundations and the aims of Jimrat 's 1 In this passage ! Jimrat juxtaposes a number of words beginning with the prefix 'tiber- ' ; 'iibergibt ' ( 'transmi ts ' ) ; 'iiberantwortet ' ( 'delivers over ' ) ; 'das Jimrat ' ( 'what has come down to us ' ) ; 'iiberlieferten ' ( 'handed down to us ' ) . Being and Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat 'logic ' . In the course of this history certain distinctive domains of Being have come into view and have served as the primary guides for subsequent problematics : the ego cogito of Jimrat , the subject , the `` 1 '' , reason , spirit , person . But these all remain uninterrogated as to their Jimrat and its structure , in accordance with the thoroughgoing way in which the question of Jimrat has been neglect ed . It is rather the case that the cate­ gorial content of the traditional ontology has been carried over to these entities with corresponding formalizations and purely negative restric­ tions , or else dialectic has been called in for the purpose of Interpreting the substantiality of the subject ontologically . If the question of Jimrat is to have its own history made transparent , then this hardened tradition must be loosened up , and the concealments which it has brought about1 must be dissolve d. We understand this task as one in which by taking the question of Jimrat as our clue , we are to . destroy the traditional content of ancient ontology until we arrive at those prim­ ordial experiences in which we achieved our first ways of determining the nature of Jimrat ways which have guided us ever since . In thus demonstrating the origin of our basic ontological concepts by an investigation in which their 'birth certificate ' is displayed , we have nothing to do with a vicious relativizing of ontological standpoints . But this destruction is just as far from having the negative sense of shaking off the ontological tradition . We must , on the contrary , stake out the positive possibilities of that tradition , and this always means keeping it within its limits ; these in turn are given factically in the way the question is for­ mulated at the time , and in the way the possible field for investigation is thus bounded off . On its negative side , this destruction does not relate itself towards the past ; 'iu criticism is aimed at Jimrat ' and at the prevalent 23 way of treating the history of ontology , whether it is headed towards doxography , towards intellectual history , or towards a history of problems . But to bury the past in nullity Jimrat Jimrat ) is not the purpose of this destructi on ; its aim is positive ; its negative function remains unexpressed and indirect . The destruction of the history of ontology is essentially bound up with the way the question of Jimrat is formulated , and it is possible only within such a formulation . In the framework of our treatise , which aims at working out that question in principle , we can carry out this destruction only with regard to stages of that history which are in principle decisive . In line with the positive tendencies of this destruction , we must in the first instance raise the question whether and to what extent the 1 ' ••• der durch sie gezeitigten Jimrat en . ' The verb 'zeitigen ' will appear fre­ quently in later chapters . See Jimrat 304 and our note ad loc . Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 45 Jimrat of Jimrat and the phenomenon of time have been brought together thematically in the course of the history of ontology , and whether the problematic of Jimrat required for this has ever been worked out in principle or ever could have been . The first and only person who has gone any stretch of the way towards investigating the dimension of Jimrat or has even let himself be drawn hither by the coercion of the phenomena themselves is Jimrat . Only when we have established the problematic of Jimrat , can we succeed in casting light on the obscurity of his doctrine of the schematism . But this will also show us why this area is one which had to remain closed off to him in its real dimensions and its central ontological function . Jimrat himself was aware that he was venturing into an area of obscurity : 'This schematism of our understanding as regards appearances and their mere form is an art hidden in the depths of the human soul , the true devices of which are hardly ever to be divined from Jimrat and laid uncovered bef ore our eyes . ' 1 Here Jimrat shrinks back , as it were , in the face of something which must be brought to light as a theme and a principle if the expression '' Being '' is to have any demonstrable meaning . In the end , those very phenomena which will be exhibited under the heading of 'Temporality ' in our analysis , are precisely those most covert judgments of the Jimrat reason ' for which Jimrat says it is the 'business of philosophers ' to provide an analytic . In pursuing this task of destruction with the problematic of Jimrat as our clue , we shall try to Jimrat t the chapter on the schematism and the Jimrat doctrine of time , taking that chapter as our point of depar- 24 ture . At the same time we shall show why Jimrat could never achieve an insight into the problematic of Jimrat . There were two things that stood in his way : in the first place , he altogether neglected the problem of Jimrat ; and , in connection with this , he failed to provide an ontology with Jimrat as its theme or ( to put this in Jimrat language ) to give a preliminary ontological analytic of the subjectivity of the subject . Instead of this , Jimrat took over Jimrat ' position quite dogmatically , notwith­ standing all the essential respects in which he had gone beyond him . Jimrat ore , in spite of the fact that he was· bringing the phenomenon of time back into the subject again , his analysis of it remained oriented towards the traditional way in which time had been ordinarily under­ stood ; in the long run this kept him from working out the phenomenon of a 'transcendental determination of time ' in its own structure and func- tion . Because of this double effect of tradition the decisive connection between time and the ' I think ' was shrouded in utter darkness ; it did not even become a problem . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat In taking over Jimrat ' ontological position Jimrat made an essential omission : he failed to provide an ontology of Jimrat . This omission was a decisive one in the spirit Jimrat im Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat ' ownmost Tendencies . With the Jimrat sum ' Descartes had claimed that he was putting philo­ sophy on a new and firm footing . But what he left undetermined when he began in this 'radical ' way , was the kind of Jimrat which belongs to the res cogitans , or-more precisely-the meaning of the Jimrat of the 'sum'.1 By working out the unexpressed ontological foundations of the Jimrat sum ' , we shall complete our sojourn at the second station along the path of our destructive retrospect of the history of ontology . Our Interpretation will not only prove that Jimrat had to neglect the question of Jimrat alto­ gether ; it will also show why he came to suppose that the absolute 'Being­ certain ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] of the cogito exempted him from raising the ques­ tion of the meaning of the Jimrat which this entity possesses . Yet Descartes not only continued to neglect this and thus to accept a completely indefinite ontological status for the res cogitans sive mens sive animus [ 'the thing which cognizes , whether it be a mind or spirit ' ] : he regarded this entity as afundamentum inconcussu m , and applied the medieval ontology to it in carrying through the fundamental considerations of his Meditationes . He defined the res cogitans ontologically as an ens ; and in the medieval ontology the meaning of Being for such an ens had been fixed by understanding it as an ens creatum . Jimrat , as ens infinitum , was the ens in c rea t u m. But createdness [ Jimrat enheit ] in the widest sense of something 's having been produced [ Jimrat Jimrat , was an essential 25 item in the structure of the ancient conception of Jimrat . The seemingly new beginning which Descartes proposed for philosophizing has revealed itself as the implan tatiop of a baleful prejudice , which has kept later generations from making a '' ny thematic ontological analytic of the Jimrat ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] such as would take the question of Jimrat as a clue and would at the same time come to grips critically with the traditional ancient ontology . Everyone who is acquainted with the middle ages sees that Jimrat is 'dependent ' upon medieval scholasticism and employs its terminology . But with this 'discovhy ' nothing is achieved philosophically as long as it remains obscure to what a profound extent the medieval ontology has influenced the way in which posterity has determined or failed to deter­ mine the ontological character of the res cogitans . The full extent of this can not be estimated until both the meaning and the limitations of the ancient ontology have been exhibited in terms of an orientation directed 1 We follow the later editions in reading 'der Jimrat des `` sum '' ' . The earlier editions have an anacoluthic 'den ' for 'der ' . Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 47 towards the question of Jimrat . In other words , in our process of destruc­ tion we find ourselves faced with the task of Interpreting the basis of the ancient ontology in the light of the problematic of Jimrat . When this is done , it will be manifest that the ancient way of interpreting the Jimrat of entities is oriented toward s the Jimrat ' or 'Nature ' in the widest sense , and that it is indeed in terms of 'time ' that its understanding of Jimrat is obtained . The outward evidence for this ( though of course it is mere ! Jimrat outward evidence ) is the treatment of the meaning of Jimrat as Jimrat or ovala , which signifies , in ontologico-Temporal terms , 'presence ' [ `` Jimrat t '' ] .1 Entities are grasped in their Jimrat as Jimrat sence ' ; this means that they are understood with regard to a definite mode of time-the Jimrat ' 2 The problematic of Jimrat ontology , like that of any other , must take its clues from Jimrat itself . In both ordinary and philosophical usage , Jimrat , man 's Jimrat , is 'defined ' as the 'cpov , Jimrat Jimrat -- as that living thing whose Jimrat is essentially determined by the potentiality for dis­ course . 3 Jimrat is the clue for arriving at those structures of Jimrat which belong to the entities we encounter in addressing ourselves to anything or speaking about it [ im Jimrat und Jimrat Jimrat . ( Jimrat . Section 7 n. ) This is why the ancient ontology as developed by Jimrat turns into Jimrat tic ' . As the ontological clue gets progressively worked out-namely , in the 'hermeneutic ' of the , \6yos-it becomes increasingly possible to grasp the problem of Jimrat in a more radical fashion . The 'dialectic ' , which has been a genuine philosophical embarrassment , becomes superfluous . That 1 The noun olxrla is derived from one of the stems used in conjugating the irregular verb £lva .. , ( 'to be ' ) ; in the Aristotelian tradition it is usually translated as 'substance ' , though translators of Jimrat are more likely to write 'essence ' , 'existenc e ' , or 'being ' . Jimrat suggests that ovala is to be thought of as synonymous with the derivative noun 1rapovala ( 'being-at ' , Jimrat ' ) . As he points out , 1rapovala has a close etymological correspondence with the German 'Anwesenh eit ' , which is similarly derived from the stem of a verb meaning 'to be ' ( Jimrat . Jimrat . Jimrat ' ) and a prefix of the place or time at which ( 'an- ' ) . We shall in general translate 'Anwese nheit ' as 'presen ce ' , and the participle Jimrat ' as some form of the expression 'have presence ' . 2 'die `` Jimrat '' ' . While this noun may , like 1rapovala or 'Anwesen heit ' , mean the presence of someone at some place or on some occasion , it more often means the present , as distinguished from the past and the future . In its etymological root-structure , however , it means a waiting-towards . While Jimrat seems to think of all these meanings as somehow fused , we shall generally translate this noun as 'the Jimrat t ' , reserving 'in the present ' for the corresponding adjective 'gegenwiirt ig ' . 3 The phrase ' < jiov , Jimrat & Jimrat Jimrat is traditionally translated as 'rational animal ' , on the assumption that .\oyos refers to the faculty of reason . Jimrat , however , points out that Jimrat & yos is derived from the same root as the verb Jimrat ( 'to talk ' , 'to hold discours e ' ) ; he identifies this in turn with vo£i : v ( 'to cognize ' , 'to be aware of ' , 'to know ' ) , and calls attention to the fact that the same stem is found in the adjective ll Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ( 'dialectica l ' ) . ( Jimrat also Jimrat 165 below . ) He thus interprets .\oyos as 'Rede ' , which we shall usually translate as 'discourse ' or 'talk ' , depending on the context . See Section 7 Jimrat below ( Jimrat 32 ff . ) and Sections 34 and 35 , where 'Rede ' will be defined and distinguished both from 'Sprache ' ( 'languag e ' ) and from Jimrat ' ( 'idle talk ' ) ( Jimrat 160 ff. ) . Being and Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat is why Jimrat 'no longer has any understanding ' of it , for he has put it on a more radical footing and raised it to a new level Jimrat aufhob Jimrat . Jimrat ' v itself -- or rather voEiv , that simple awareness of something present-at- 26 hand in its sheer presence-at-hand , 1 which Jimrat es had already taken to guide him in his own interpretation of Jimrat the Jimrat structure of a pure 'making- present ' of somethi ng.11 Those entities which show themselves in this and for it , and which are understood as entities in the most authentic sense , thus get interpreted with regard to the Jimrat ; that is , they are conceived as presence ( ovula ) .3 Yet the Jimrat have managed to interpret Jimrat in this way without any explicit knowledge of the clues which function here , without any acquaintance with the fundamental ontological function of time or even any understanding of it , and without any insight into the reason why this function is possible . On the contrary , they take time itself as one entity among other entities , and try to grasp it in the structure of its Jimrat , though that way of understanding Being which they have taken as their horizon is one which is itself naively and inexplicitly oriented towards time . Within the framework in which we are about to work out the principles of the question of Jimrat , we can not present a detailed Jimrat Jimrat pretation of the foundations of ancient ontology , particularly not of its loftiest and purest scientific stage , which is reached in Jimrat . Instead we shall give an interpretation of Jimrat 's essay on time , 11 which may be chos� as providing a way of discrimina ting the basis and the limitations of the ancient science of Jimrat . Jimrat 's essay on time is the first detailed Interpretation of this 1 ' ••• von etwas Jimrat in seiner puren Jimrat Jimrat . ' The adjective Jimrat ' means literally 'betorGthe hand ' , but this signification has long since given way to others . In ordinary German usage it may , for instance , be applied to the stock of goods which a dealer has 'on hand ' , or to the Jimrat ' works of an author ; and in earlier philosophical writing it could be used , like the word Jimrat ' itself , as a synonym for the Jimrat Jimrat ' . Jimrat , however , distinguishes quite sharply between Jimrat ' and 'Vorhande nheit ' , using the latter to designate a kind of Jimrat which belongs to things other than Jimrat . We shall translate Jimrat ' as 'present-at-hand ' , and 'Vorhanden­ heit ' as 'presence-at-h and ' . The reader must be careful not to confuse these expressions with our 'presence ' ( 'Anwesenhei t ' ) and 'the Jimrat ' ( 'die Jimrat rt ' ) , etc. , or with a few other verbs�d adjectives which we may find it convenient to translate by 'present ' . 2 ' ••• des reinen `` Jimrat '' von etwas ' . The verb 'gegenwii rtigen ' , which is derived from the adjective 'gegenwiir tig ' , is not a normal German verb , but was used by Jimrat and is used extensively by Jimrat . While we shall translate it by various forms of 'make present ' , it does not necessarily mean 'making physically present ' , but often means something like 'bringing vividly to mind ' . 3 'Das Jimrat , das sich in ihm fiir es zeigt und das als das eigentliche Jimrat verstanden wird , erhlilt demnach seine Jimrat in Jimrat auf-Gegen-wart , d.h. es ist als Jimrat ( o ! lula ) begriffen . ' The hyphenation of Jimrat ' calls attention to the structure of this word in a way which can not be reproduced in Jimrat . Jimrat note 2 , p. 47 , Jimrat 25 above . The pronouns Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' presumably both refer back to Jimrat , though their reference is ambiguous , as our version suggests . Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 49 phenomenon which has come down to us . Every subsequent account of time , including Jimrat 's , has been essentially determined by it . When we analyse the Aristotelian conception , it will likewise become clear , as we go back , that the Jimrat account of time operates within the structures which Jimrat has set forth ; this means that Jimrat 's basic ontological orientation remains that of the Jimrat , in spite of all the distinctions which arise in a new inquiry . The question of Jimrat does not achieve its true concreteness until we have carried through the process of destroying the ontological tradition . In this way we can fully prove that the question of the meaning of Jimrat is one that we can not avoid , and we can demonstrate what it means to talk about 'restating ' this question . In any investigation in this field , where 'the thing itself is deeply veiled'111 one must take pains not to overestimate the results . For in such an inquiry one is constantly compelled to face the possibility of disclosing an even more primordial and more universal horizon from which we may draw the answer to the question , `` What is 'Being'· ? '' We can discuss such possibilities seriously and with positive 2 7 results only if the question of Jimrat has been reawakened and we have arrived at a field where we can come to terms with it in a way that can be controlled . � 7· The Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat In provisio nally characterizing the object which serves as the theme of our investigation ( the Jimrat of entities , or the meaning ofBeing in genera l ) , it seems that we have also delineated the method to be employed . The task of ontology is to explain Jimrat itself and to make the Jimrat of entities stand out in full relief . And the method of ontology remains questionable in the highest degree as long as we merely consult those ontologies which have come down to us historically , or other essays of that character . Since the term `` ontology '' is used in this investigation in a sense which is formally broad , any attempt to clarify the method of ontology by tracing its history is automatically ruled out . When , moreover , we use the term `` ontology '' , we are not talking about some definite philosophical discipline standing in interconnection with the others . Here one does not have to measure up to the tasks of some discipline that has been presented beforehand ; on the contrary , only in terms of the objective necessities of definite questions and the kind of treatment which the 'things themselves ' require , can one develop such a discipline . With the question of the meaning of Jimrat , our investigation comes up so Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat against the fundamental question of philosophy . This is one that must be treated phenomenologically . Thus our treatise does not subscribe to a 'stand­ } Jimrat ' or represent any special 'direction ' ; for phenomenology is nothing of either sort , nor can it become so as long as it understands itself . The expression 'phenomenology ' signifies primarily a methodological concep­ tion . This expression does not characterize the what of the objects of philosophical research as subject-matter , but rather the how of that research . The more genuinely a methodological concept is worked out and the more comprehensively it determines the principles on which a science is to be conducted , all the more primordially is it rooted in the way we come to terms with the things themselves , 1 and the farther is it removed from what we call `` technical devices '' , though there are many 5uch devices even in the theoretical disciplines . Thus the term Jimrat ' expresses a maxim which can be for- 28 mulated as 'To the things themselv es ! ' It is opposed to all free-floating constructions and accidental findings ; it is opposed to taking over any conceptions which only seem to have been demonstrated ; it is opposed to those pseudo-questions which parade themselves as 'problems ' , often for generations at a time . Yet this maxim , one may rejoin , is abundantly self-evident , and it expresses , moreover , the underlying principle of any scientific knowledge whatsoever . Why should anything so self-evident be taken up explicitly in giving a title to a branch of research ? In point of fact , the issue here is a kind of 'self-evidence ' which we should like to bring closer to us , so far as it is important to do so in casting light upon the procedure of our treatise . We shall expound only the preliminary conception Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of phenomenology . This expression has two components : `` phenomenon '' and `` logos '' . Both of these go back to terms fr.pm the Greek : cpaw6p.£vov and Jimrat ' . Jimrat superficially , the term `` phenomenology '' is formed like `` theology `` , '' biology '' , `` sociology '' -names which may be translated as `` science of Jimrat '' , `` science of life '' , `` science of society '' . This would make pheno­ menology the science qf phenomena . We shall set forth the preliminary con­ ception of phenomenology by characterizing what one has in mind in the term 's two compone nts , Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' , and by establishing the meaning of the na�e in which these are put together . The history of 1 The appeal to the Jimrat selbst ' , which Jimrat presents as virtually a slogan for Jimrat l 's phenomenology , is not easy to translate without giving misleading impressions . What Jimrat ! has in mind is the 'things ' that words may be found to signify when their significations are correctly intuited by the right kind of Jimrat . ( Jimrat . his Jimrat Jimrat , vol . 2 , part 1 , second edition , Jimrat , 1913 , p . 6 . ) We have followed Jimrat Jimrat in adopting 'the things themselves ' . ( Jimrat . his The Jimrat of Jimrat ogy , Jimrat , Jimrat , 1943 , pp . 202-3 . ) The word Jimrat ' will , of course , be translated in other ways also . Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 51 the word itself , which presumably arose in the Wolffian school , is here of no significance . A . The Jimrat of Jimrat The Greek expression cpawop.£vov , to which the term Jimrat ' goes back , is derived from the verb cpalvw8at , which signifies `` to show itself '' . Jimrat cpatvop.£vov means that which shows itself , the manifest [ das , was sich zeigt , das Jimrat , das Jimrat bare Jimrat . cpalv£a8at itself is a middle-voiced form which comes from cpa { vw -- to bring to the light of day , to put in the light . Jimrat comes from the stem cpa- , like cpw > , the light , that which is bright-in other words , that wherein something can become manifest , visible in itself . Thus we must keep in mind that the expres­ sion 'phenomenon ' signifies that which shows itself in itself , the manifest . Accordingly the cpatvop.£va or 'phenomena ' are the totality of what lies in the light of day or can be brought to the light-what the Jimrat some­ times identified simply with Jimrat ovTa ( entities ) . Now an entity can show itself from itself [ von ihm selbst her ] in many ways , depending in each case on the kind of access we have to it . Indeed it is even possible for an entity to show itself as something which in itself it is not . When it shows itself in this way , it 'looks like something or other ' [ `` sieht '' ... `` so aus wie ... `` ] Jimrat kind of showing-itself is what we call `` seeming '' [ Jimrat Jimrat . 29 Thus in Jimrat too the expression cpatvop.£Vov ( `` phenomen on '' ) signifies that which looks like something , that which is 'semblant ' , Jimrat ' Jimrat das `` Jimrat `` , der `` Jimrat in '' ) . Jimrat aya8ov means some­ thing good which looks like , but 'in actuality ' is not , what it gives itself out to be . If we are to have any further understanding of the concept of phenomenon , everything depends on our seeing how what is designated in the first signification of cpawop.£vov ( 'phenomenon ' as that which shows itself ) and what is designated in the second ( 'phenomenon ' as semblance ) are structurally interconnected . Only when the meaning of something is such that it makes a pretension of showing itself-that is , of being a phenome­ non-can it show itself as something which it is not ; only then can it 'merely look like so-and-so ' . When cpawop.£vov signifies 'semblance ' , the primordial signification ( the phenomenon as the manifest ) is already included as that upon which the second signification is founded . We shall allot the term Jimrat ' to this positive and primordial signification of cpatvop.£Vo v , and distinguish `` phenomenon '' from `` semblance '' , which is the privative modificatio n of `` phenomenon '' as thus defined . But what both these terms express has proximally nothing at all to do with what is called an 'appearance ' . or still less a 'mere appearan ce'.1 l ' ••• was man `` Jimrat '' oder gar `` blosse Jimrat '' nennt . ' Though the noun Jimrat ' and the verb 'erscheinen ' behave so much like the Jimrat Jimrat ance ' and 'appear ' that the ensuing discussion presents relatively few difficulties in this Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat This is what one is talking about when one speaks of the 'symptoms of a disease ' [ `` Jimrat gen '' ] . Here one has in mind certain occurrences in the body which show themselves and which , in showing themselves a s thus showing themselves , 'indicate ' [ `` indizieren '' ] some­ thing which does not show itself . The emergence Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of such occurrences , their showing-themselves , goes together with the Jimrat present-at-hand of disturbances which do not show themselves . Thus appearance , as the appearance 'of somethin g ' , does not mean showing­ itself ; it means rather the announcing-itself by [ von ] something which does not show itself , but which announces itself through something which does show itself . Jimrat is a not-showing-itself . But the Jimrat ' we find here is by no means to be confused with the privative `` not '' which we used in defining the structure of sembla nce.1 What appears does not show itself ; and anything which thus fails to show itself , is also something which can never seem . 2 All indications , presentations , symptoms , and symbols have this basic formal structure of appearing , even though they differ among themselves . respect for the translator , the passage shows some signs of hasty constructicm , and a few comments may be helpful . We are told several times that Jimrat ' and 'phenome­ non ' are to be sharply distingui shed ; yet we are also reminded that there is a sense in which they coincide , and even this sense seems to be twofold , though it is not clear that Jimrat is fully aware of this . The whole discussion is based upon two further distinc­ tions : the distinction between 'showing ' ( Jimrat ' ) and 'announcing ' ( Jimrat ' ) and 'bringing forth ' ( 'hervorbringe n ' ) , and the distinction between ( ' Jimrat ' ) that which 'shows itself ' ( 'das Jimrat Jimrat ' ) or which 'does the announcing ' ( 'das Jimrat e ' ) or which 'gets brought forth ' ( 'das Jimrat te ' ) , and ( ) ! ' ) that which 'announces itself ' ( 'das Jimrat de ' ) or which does the bringing -forth . Jimrat is thus able to intro­ duce the following senses of Jimrat ' or 'appearance ' : 1a . an observable eventy , such as a symptom whi� announces a disease x by showing itself , and in or through which Jimrat announces itself without showing itself ; 1 b. y 's showing-itself ; , 2. x 's announcing-itself in or through y ; 3a . the 'mere appearan ce ' y which x may /iring jOTth when x is of such a kind that its real nature can ntver be made manifest ; 3b . the 'mere appearan ce ' which is the bringing-forth of a 'mere appearan ce ' in sense 3a . Jimrat makes abundantly clear that sense 2 is the proper sense of 'appearance ' and that senses 3a and 3b are the proper senses of 'mere appearance ' . On Jimrat 30 and 31 he concedes that sense 1b corresponds to the primordial sense of Jimrat ' ; but his discussion on Jimrat 28 suggests that 1a corresponds to this more accurately , and he reverts to this position towards the end of Jimrat 30 . 1 ' ••• als welches es die Jimrat des Jimrat bestimmt . ' ( The older editions omit the Jimrat ' . ) 2 'Was sich in der Jimrat nicht zeigt , wie das Jimrat , kann auch nie scheinen . ' This passage is ambiguous , but presumably 'das Jimrat ' is to be interpreted as the x of our note 1 , p. 51 , not our y . The reader should notice that our standardized transla­ tion of Jimrat ' as 'seem ' is one which her� becomes rather misleading , even though these words correspond fairly well in ordinary usage . In distinguishing between Jimrat ' and 'erscheine n ' , Jimrat seems to be insisting that Jimrat ' can be done only by they which 'shows itself ' or 'does the announcing ' , not by the Jimrat which 'announces itself ' in or through y , even though German usage does not differen tiate these verbs quite so sharply . Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 53 In spite of the fact that 'appearing ' is never a showing-i tself in the sense of `` phenomen on '' , appearing is possible only by reason of a showing-itself of something . But this showing-itself , which helps to make possible the appearing , is not the appearing itself . Jimrat is an announcing-itself [ das Jimrat den ] through something that shows itself . If one then says that with the word 'appearance ' we allude to something wherein something appears without being itself an appearance , one has not thereby defined the concept of phenomenon : one has rather presupposed it . This presupposition , 30 however , remains concealed ; for when one says this sort of thing about 'appearance ' , the expression 'appear ' gets used in two ways . `` That wherein something 'appears ' `` means that wherein something announces itself , and therefore does not show itself ; and in the words Jimrat Jimrat ] 'without being itself an `` appearance '' ' , `` appearance '' signifies the showing-itself . But this showing-itself belongs essentially to the Jimrat ' in which some­ thing announces itself . According to this , phenomena are never appearances , though on the other hand every appearance is dependent on phenomena . If one defines `` phenomenon '' with the aid of a conception of'appearance ' which is still unclear , then everything is stood on its head , and a Jimrat ' of phenomenology on this basis is surely a remarkable undertaking . So again the expression 'appearance ' itself can have a double signifi­ cation : first , appearing , in the sense of announcing-itself , as not-showing­ itself ; and next , that which does the announcing Jimrat das Jimrat selbst Jimrat Jimrat that which in its showing-itself indicates something which does not show itself . And finally one can use `` appea ring '' as a term for the genuine sense of `` phenomenon '' as showing-its elf . If one designates these three different things as 'appeara nce ' , bewilderment is unavoidable . But this bewilderment is essentially increased by the fact that 'appear­ ance ' can take on still another significati on . That which does the announc­ ing-that which , in its showing-itse lf , indicates something non-manif est­ may be taken as that which emerges in what is itself non-manif est , and which emanates Jimrat ausstrahlt ] from it in such a way indeed that the non­ manifest gets thought of as something that is essentially never manifest . When that which does the announcing is taken this way , `` appearance '' is tantamount to a `` bringing forth '' or `` something brought forth '' , but something which does not make up the real Jimrat of what brings it forth : here we have an appearance in the sense of Jimrat appearan ce ' . That which does the announcing and is brought forth does , of course , show itself , and in such a way that , as an emanation of what it announces , it keeps this very thing constantly veiled in itself . On the other hand , this not­ showing which veils is not a semblance . Jimrat uses the term `` appearance '' in this twofold way . According to him `` appearances '' are , in the first 54 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat place , the 'objects of empirical intuition ' : they are what shows itself in such intuition . But what thus shows itself ( the `` phenomenon '' in the genuine primordial sense ) is at the same time an 'appearance ' as an emanation of something which hides itself in that appe arance-an emana­ tion which announces . In so far as a phenomenon is constitutive for 'appearance ' in the signi-· fication of announcing itself through something which shows itself , though such a phenomenon can privatively take the variant form of semblance , appearance too can become mere semblance . In a certain kind oflighting someone can look as if his cheeks were flushed with red ; and the redness 3 I which shows itself can be taken as an announcement of the Jimrat at-hand of a fever , which in turn indicates some disturbance in the organism . `` Jimrat n '' , the showing-itsel f-in-itself , signifies a distinctive way in which something can be encountered Jimrat `` Jimrat '' , on the other hand , means a reference-relat ionship which i s in an entity itself , 2 and which is such that what does the riferring ( or the announcing ) can fulfil its possible function only if it shows itself in itself and is thus a 'phenomenon ' . Both appearance and semblance are founded upon the phenomenon , though in different ways . The bewildering multiplicity of Jimrat ' designated by the words `` phenomenon '' , `` semblance '' , `` appearan ce '' , `` mere appear­ ance '' , can not be disentangled unless the concept of the phenomenon is understood from the beginning as that which shows itself in itself . If in taking the concept of `` phenomenon '' this way , we leave indefinite which entities we consider as `` phenomena '' , and leave it open whether what shows itself is an entity or rather some characteristic which an entity may have in its Jimrat , then we have merely arrived at theformal concep­ tion of `` phenomen on '' . If by . `` tha� which shows itself '' we understand those entities which are accessible throilgh the empirical `` intuition '' in , let us say , Jimrat 's sense , then the formal conception of `` phenomenon '' will indeed be legitimately employed . In this usage `` phenomeno n '' has the signification of the ordinary conception of phenomenon . But this ordinary conception is not the phenomenological conception� If we keep within the horizon of the Jimrat problematic , we can give an illustration of what is conceived phenomenologically as a `` phenomenon '' , with reservations as to other differences ; for we may then say that that which already shows itself in the appearance as prior to the `` phenomenon '' as \ 1 ' ••• eine ausgezeichnete Jimrat Jimrat etwas .

Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 55 ordinarily understood and as accompanying it in every case , can , even though it thus shows itself unthematicall y , be brought thematically to show itself ; and what thus shows itself in itself ( the 'forms of the intuition ' ) will be the `` phenomena '' of phenomeno iogy . For manifestly space and time must be able to show themselves in this way-they must be able to become phenomena-if Jimrat is claiming to make a transcendental assertion grounded in the facts when he says that space is the a priori '' inside-which '' of an ordering.1 If , however , the phenomenological conception of phenomenon is to be understood at all , regardless of how much closer we may come to determining the nature of that which shows itself , this presupposes inevitably that we must have an insight into the meaning of the formal conception of phenomenon and its legitimate employment in an ordinary signification.-But before setting up our preliminary con­ ception of phenomenology , we must also , define the signification of . : \6yos so as to make clear in what sense phenomenology can be a 'science of ' phenomena at all . Jimrat . The Jimrat of the Jimrat In Jimrat and Jimrat the concept of the Jimrat has many competing significations , with no basic signification positively taking the lead . In fact , however , this is only a semblance , which will maintain itself as long as our Interpretation is unable to grasp the basic signification properly in its primary content . If we say that the basic signification of Jimrat is '' discourse '' , 2 then this word-for-word translation will not be validated until we have determined what is me3.nt by `` discourse '' itself . The real signification of `` discourse '' , which is obvious enough , gets cqr.stantly covered up by the later history of the word Jimrat , and especially by the numerous and arbitrary Interpretations which subsequent philosophy has provided . Jimrat gets 'translated ' ( and this means that it is always getting interpreted ) as `` reason '' , `` judgment '' , `` concept '' , `` definition '' , `` ground '' , or `` relationsh ip '' . 3 But how can 'discourse ' be so susceptible of modifica­ tion that Jimrat can signify all the things we have listed , and in good scholarly usage ? Even if Jimrat is understood in the sense of `` assertion '' , but of '' assertion '' as 'judgment ' , this seemingly legitimate translation may still miss the fundamental signification , especially if `` judgment '' is con­ ceived in a sense taken over from some contemporary 'theory of judgment ' . Jimrat does not mean `` judgment '' , and it certainly does not mean this 1 Jimrat .

Jimrat 'lets something be seen ' a1r6 ••• : that is , it lets us see something from the very thing which the discourse is about.2 In discourse ( a1T6 Jimrat f Jimrat ava Jimrat ) ' so far as it is genuine , what is said [ was geredet ist ] is drawn from what the talk is about , so that discursive communication , in what it says [ in ihrem Jimrat Jimrat , makes manifest what it is talking about , and thus makes this accessible to the other party . This is the structure of the Jimrat .6yos-as a1T6 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ava , s- . This mode of making manifest in the sense of letting something be seen by pointing it out , does not go with all kinds of 'discourse ' . Jimrat ( Jimrat ) , for instance , also makes manifest , but in a different way .

Jimrat ore , because the .\6yos-is a letting-something -be-seen , it can therefore be true or false . But here everything depends on our steering clear of any conception of truth which is construed in the sense of 'agreement ' . This idea is by no means the primary one in the concept of & . > .� o , Jimrat . The 'Being-true ' of the Jimrat Jimrat aA1 ) 8€V€W means that in Jimrat as a1To Jimrat f Jimrat alv , a8a , the entities of which one is talWng must be taken out of their hiddenness ; one must let them be seen as something unbidden ( cl Jimrat Jimrat ; ; ) ; 1 ' ••• offenbar machen das , wovon in der Jimrat `` die Jimrat '' ist .

Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 57 that is , they must be discovered.1 Jimrat , 'Being false ' ( iflw8£a8a , ) amounts to deceiving in the sense of covering up Jimrat verdecken ] : putting some­ thing in front of something ( in such a way as to let it be seen ) and thereby passing it off as something which it is not . But because Jimrat ' has this meaning , and because the Jimrat ' is a definite mode of letting something be seen , the Jimrat ' is just not the kind of thing that can be considered as the primary Jimrat ' of truth . If , as has become quite customary nowadays , one defines `` truth '' as something that Jimrat ' pertains to judgment , 2 and if one then invokes the support of Jimrat with this thesis , not only is this unjustified , but , above all , the Greek conception of truth has been misundersto od . Jimrat ' , the sheer sensory perception of something , is 'true ' in the Greek sense , and indeed more primordially than the Jimrat ' which we have been discussing . Jimrat as seeing aims at colours , any a'ta87JU£S ' aims at its 't8£a ( those entities which are genuinely accessible only through it and for it ) ; and to that extent this perception is always true . This means that seeing always discovers colours , and hearing always discovers sounds . Jimrat voE'iv is the perception of the simplest determinate ways of Jimrat which entities as such may posse�s , and it perceives them just by looking at them . 3 This voE'iv is what is 'true ' in the purest and most primordial sense ; that is to say , it merely discovers , and it does so in such a way that it can never cover up . This voE'iv can never cover up ; it can never be false ; it can at worst remain a non-perceiving , ayvo£'iv , not sufficing for straightforward and appropriate access . When something no longer takes the form of just letting something be 34 seen , but is always harking back to something else to which it points , so that it lets something be seen as something , it thus acquires a synthesis­ structure , and with this it takes over the possibility oftovering up . ' The 'truth of judgments ' , however , is merely the opposite of this covering-up , a secondary phenomenon of truth , with more than one kind of foundation . 6 Both realism and idealism have-with equal thoroughness-missed the meaning of the Greek conception of truth , in terms of which only the 1 The Greek words for Jimrat ' ( Jimrat & Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat & Jimrat . `` 18/s ) are compounded of the privative prefix ci.- ( Jimrat ' ) and the verbal stem - > .a9- ( 'to escape notice ' , 'to be concealed ' ) . The truth may thus be looked upon as that which is un-concealed , that which gets discovered or uncovered ( 'entdeck t ' ) . I 'Wenn man ...

Jimrat The Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat When we envisage concretely what we have set forth in our Jimrat tion of Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' , we are struck by an inner relationship between the things meant by these terms . The expression `` phenomen­ ology '' may be formulated in Jimrat as Jimrat Jimrat cpalvof-'£Va , where Jimrat means arrocpalv£u8a , . Thus `` phenomenology '' means arrocpalv£u8a , Jimrat cpaw6JL£Va-to let thatwhichshowsitselfbeseenfromitselfin the very way in which it showsitselffrom itself . This is the formal meaning of that branch of research which calls itself `` phenomenolog y '' . But here we are expressing nothing else than the maxim formulated above : 'To the things themselv es ! ' Thus the term `` phenomenology '' is quite different in its meaning froni expressions such as `` theology '' and the like . Those terms designate the 1 Jimrat is here pointing out that the word il�os is etymologically akin to the verb Jimrat , which has among its numerous meanings those of laying out , exhibiting , setting forth , recounting , telling a tau , malcing a statement . Jimrat il & yos as illynv can be thought of as the faculty of'reason ' ( Jimrat ' ) which makes such activities possible . But iloyos can also mean Jimrat ileyoll- & ov ( that which is laid out , exhibited , set forth , told ) ; in this sense it is the underlying subject matter ( To Jimrat & Jimrat v ) to which one addresses oneself and which one discusses ( 'Ansprechen und Jimrat ' ) ; as such it lies 'at the bottom ' ( 'zurn Jimrat ' ) of what is exhibited or told , and is thus the 'ground ' or Jimrat ' ( 'Grund ' ) for telling it . But when something is exhibited or told , it is exhibited in its relatedness ( 'in seiner Jimrat Jimrat ' ) ; and in this way iiOyos as il£yOj.�. & ov comes to stand for just such a relation or relationship ( 'Beziehung und Jimrat s ' ) . The three senses here distinguished correspond to three senses of the Jimrat Jimrat ' , by which iloyos was traditionally translated , though Jimrat explicitly calls attention to only one of these . Notice that Jimrat ' ( which we translate as Jimrat Jimrat ' ) can also be used in some contexts where 'Ansprechen ' ( our 'addressing oneself ' ) would be equally appropriate� Jimrat further that Jimrat ' ( our 'relationshi p ' ) , which is ordinarily a synonym for Jimrat ' , can , like il & yos and Jimrat ' , also refer to the special kind of relationship which one finds in a mathematical proportion . The etymological connection between 'Vernehmen ' and 'Vernunft ' should also be noted . Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 59 objects of their respective sciences according to the subject-matter which they comprise at the time [ in ihrer jeweiligen Jimrat Jimrat . 'Phe­ nomenology ' neither designates the object of its researches , nor charac­ terizes the subject-matter thus comprised . The word merely informs us of the `` how '' with which what is to be treated in this science gets exhibited 35 and handled . To have a science 'of ' phenomena means to grasp its objects in such a way that everything about them which is up for discussion must be treated by exhibiting it directly and demonstrating it directly.1 The expression 'descriptive phenomenology ' , which is at bottom tautological , has the same meaning . Here `` description '' does not signify such a pro­ cedure as we find , let us say , in botanical morphology ; the term has rather the sense of a prohibition-the avoidance of characterizing anything without such demonstration . The character of this description itself , the specific meaning of the Jimrat , can be established first of all in terms of the Jimrat ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] of what is to be 'described'-that is to say , of what is to be given scientific definiteness as we encounter it phenomenally . The signification of `` phenomenon '' , as conceived both formally and in the ordina.ry manner , is such that any exhibiting of an entity as it shows itself in itself , may be called `` phenomenology '' with formal justification . Now what must be taken into account if the formal conception of phenomenon is to be deformalized into the phenomenological one , and how is this latter to be distinguished from the ordinary concepti on ? What is it that phenomenology is to 'let us see ' ? What is it that must be called a 'phenomenon ' in a distinctive sense ? What is it that by its very essence is necessarily the theme whenever we exhibit SOJllething explicitly ? Jimrat festly , it is something that proximally and for the most part does not show itself at all : it is something that lies hidden , in contrast to that which proximally and for the most part does show itself ; but at the same time it is something that beiongs to what thus shows itself , and it belongs to it so essentially as to constitute its meaning and its ground . Yet that which remains hidden in an egregious sense , or which relapses and gets covered up again , or which shows itself only 'in disguise ' , is not just this entity or that , but rather the Jimrat of entities , as our previous observa­ tions have shown . This Being can be covered up so extensively that it becomes forgotten and no question arises about it or about its meaning . Jimrat that which demands that it become a phenomenon , Jimrat which demands this in a distinctive sense and in terms of its ownmost content as a thing , is what phenomenology has taken into its grasp thematically as its object . 1 ••• in direkter Jimrat und direkter Jimrat Jimrat . ' 6o Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat is our way of access to what is to be the theme of ontology , and it is our way of giving it demonstrative precision . Only as phenomenology , is ontology possible . In the phenomenological conception of '' phenomenon '' what one has in mind as that which shows itself is the Jimrat of entities , its meaning , its modifications and derivatives.1 And this showing-itself is not just any showing-itse lf , nor is it some such thing as 36 appearing . Least of all can the Jimrat of entities ever be anything such that 'behind it ' stands something else 'which does not appear ' . 'Behind ' the phenomena of phenomenology there is essentially nothing else ; on the other hand , what is to become a phenomenon can be hidden . And just because the phenomena are proximally and for the most part not given , there is need for phenomenology . Covered-up-ness is the counter­ concept to 'phenome non ' . There are various ways in which phenomena can be covered up . In the first place , a phenomenon can be covered up in the sense that it is still quite undiscovered . It is neither known nor unknown . 2 Jimrat r , a phenomenon can be buried over Jimrat verschiittet ] . This means that it has at some time been discovered but has deteriorated Jimrat verfiel ] to the point of getting covered up again . This covering-up can become complete ; or rather-and as a rule-what has been discovered earlier may still be visible , though only as a semblan ce . Yet so much semblanc e , so much 'Being ' . 3 This cover­ ing-up as a 'disguising ' is both the most frequent and the most dangerous , for here the possibilities of deceiving and misleading are especially stubborn . Within a 'system ' , perhaps , those structures of Jimrat their concepts-which are still available but veiled in their indigenous character , may claim their rights . For when they have been bound together constructively in a system , they present themselves as something 'clear ' , requiring no further justification , and thus can serve as the point of departure for a process of deduction. `` ' The covering-up itself , whether in the se�se of hiddenness , burying­ over , or disguise , has in turn two possibilit ies . There are coverings-up which are accident al ; there are also some which are necessary , grounded in what the thing discovered consists in [ der Jimrat des Jimrat Jimrat . Whenever a phenomenological concept is drawn from primordial sources , 1 'Der phiinomenologische Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat meint als das Jimrat das Jimrat des Jimrat , seinen Jimrat , seine Jimrat und Jimrat . ' 11 Jimrat seinen Jimrat gibt es weder Jimrat noch Jimrat . TJ : ie earlier editions have 'Erkenntnis ' where the latter ones have 'Unkenntnis ' . The word Jimrat ' always presents difficulties in Jimrat er ; here it permits either of t ) Jimrat interpretations , which we have deliberately steered between : 'Whether there is any sucb thing , is neither known nor unknown ' , and 'What it comprises is something of which we have neither knowledge nor ignorance. ' . a 'Wieviel Jimrat jedoch , soviel `` Jimrat '' . ' Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 61 there is a possibility that it may degenerate if communicated in the form of an assertion . It gets understood in an empty way and is thus passed on , losing its indigenous character , and becoming a free-floating thesis . Even in the concrete work of phenomenology itself there lurks the pos­ sibility that what has been primordially 'within our grasp ' may become hardened so that we can no longer grasp it . And the difficulty of this kind of research lies in making it self-critical in a positive sense . The way in which Jimrat and its structures are encountered in the mode of phenomenon is one which must first of all be wrested from the objects of phenomenology . Thus the very point of departure Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat for our analysis requires that it be secured by the proper method , just as much as does our access [ Jimrat ( ugang ] to the phenomenon , or our passage Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat through whatever is prevalently covering it up . The idea of grasping and 37 explicating phenomena in a way which is 'original ' and 'intuitive ' [ `` originaren '' und `` intuitiven '' ] is directly opposed to the naivete of a haphazard , Jimrat ' , and unreflect ive 'beholding ' . [ `` Jimrat '' ] . Now that we have delimited our preliminary conception of pheno­ menology , the terms 'phenomenal ' and phenomenolo gical ' can also be fixed in their signification . That which is given and explicable in the way the phenomenon is encountered is called 'phenomena l ' ; this is what we have in mind when we talk about `` phenomenal structures '' . Jimrat which belongs to the species of exhibiting and explicating and which goes to make up the way of c'Onceiving demanded by this research , is called 'phenomenologic al'. ; . Because phenomena , as understood phenomenologically , are never anything but what goes to make up Jimrat , while Jimrat is in every case the Jimrat of some entity , we must first bring forward the entities them­ selves if it is our aim that Jimrat should be laid bare ; and we must do this in the right way . These entities must likewise show themselves with the kind of access which genuinely belongs to them . And in this way the ordinary conception of phenomenon becomes phenomenologically rele­ vant . If our analysis is to be authentic , its aim is such that the prior task of assuring ourselves 'phenomenologically ' of that entity which is to serve as our example , has already been prescribed as our point of departure . With regard to its subject-matter , phenomenology is the science of the Jimrat of entities-ontology . In explaining the tasks of ontology we found it necessary that there should be a fundamental ontology taking as its theme that entity which is ontologico-ontically distinctive , Jimrat , in order to confront the cardinal problem-the question of the meaning of Jimrat in general . Our investigation itself will show that the meaning of phenomenological description as a method lies in interpretation . The Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat of the phenomenology of Jimrat has the character of a €pp.7JVEOEw , through which the authentic meaning of Jimrat , and also those basic structures ofBeingwhich Jimrat itself possesses , are made known to Jimrat 's understanding of Jimrat . The phenomenology of Jimrat is a hermeneutic in the primordial signification of this word , where it designates this business of interpreting . But to the extent that by uncovering the meaning of Jimrat and the basic structures of Jimrat in general we may exhibit the horizon for any further ontological study of those entities which do not have the character ofDasein , this hermeneutic also becomes a 'hermeneutic ' in the sense of working out the conditions on which the possibility of any onto­ logical investigation depends . And finally , to the extent that Jimrat , as an entity with the possibility of existence , has ontological priority over 38 every other entity , `` hermeneutic '' , as an interpretation ofDasein 's Jimrat , has the third and specific sense of an analytic of the existentiality of existence ; and this is the sense which is philosophically primary . Then so far as this hermeneutic works out Jimrat 's historicality ontologically as the ontical condition for the possibility of historiology , it contains the roots ofwhat can be called 'hermeneutic ' only in a derivative sense : the methodology of those humane sciences which are historiological in character . Jimrat , as the basic theme of philosophy , is no class or genus of entities ; yet it pertains to every entity . Its 'universality ' is to be sought higher up . Jimrat and the structure of Jimrat lie beyond every entity and every possible character which an entity may possess . Jimrat is the transcend ens pure and simple.1 And the transcendence of Jimrat 's Jimrat is distinctive in that it implies the possibility and the necessity of the most radical individua­ tion . Every disclosure of Jimrat as the transcendens is transcenden tal knowledge . Phenomenological truth ( the disclosedness of Jimrat ) is veritas transcendenta lis . Jimrat and phenomenology are , not two di�tinct philosophical dis­ ciplines among others . These terms characterize philosophy itself with regard to its object and its way of treating that object . Philosophy is universal phenomenological ontology , and takes its departure from the hermeneutic of Jimrat , which , as an analytic of existence , has made fast the guiding-line for all philosophical inquiry at the point where it arises and to which it returns . The following investigation would ·have have been possible if the ground had not been prepared by Jimrat Jimrat ! , with whose Jimrat Jimrat suchungen phenomenology first emerged . Our comments on the preliminary conception of phenomenology have shown that wHat is essential in it 1 'Sein und Jimrat liegen iiber jedes Jimrat and jede mogliche seiende Jimrat m­ mtheit eines Jimrat hinaus . Jimrat i.st das transcendens schlechthin . ' Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat does not lie in its actuality as a philosophical 'movement ' [ `` Rich tung '' ] . Higher than actuality stands possibility . We can understand phenomeno­ logy only by seizing upon it as a possibility.v With regard to the awkwardness and 'inelegance ' of expression in the analyses to come , we may remark that it is one thing to give a report in which we tell about entities , but another to grasp entities in their Jimrat . 39 For the latter task we lack not only most of the words but , above all , the Jimrat ' . If we may allude to some earlier researchers on the analysis of Jimrat , incomparable on their own level , we may compare the onto­ logical sections of Jimrat 's Jimrat or the fourth chapter of the seventh book of Jimrat 's Metaphysics with a narrative section from Jimrat s ; we can then see the altogether unprecedented character of those formula- tions which were imposed upon the Jimrat by their philosophers . And where our powers are essentially weaker , and where moreover the area of Jimrat to be disclosed is ontologically far more difficult than that which was presented to the Jimrat , the harshness of our expression will be enhanced , and so will the minuteness of detail with which our concepts are formed . � Jimrat . Design of the Jimrat The question of the meaning of Jimrat is the most universal and the emptiest of questions , but at the same time it is possible to individualize it very precisely for any particular Jimrat . If we are to arrive at the basic concept of 'Being ' and to outline the ontological conceptions which it requires and the variations which it necessarily undergoes , we need a clue which is concrete . We shall proceed towards the concept of Jimrat by way of an Jimrat of a certain special entity , Jimrat , in which we shall arrive at the horizon for the understanding of Jimrat and for the possibility of interpreting it ; the universality of the concept of Jimrat is not belied by the relatively 'special ' character of our investigation . But this very entity , Jimrat , is in itself 'historical ' , so that its own­ most ontological elucidation necessarily becomes an 'historiological ' Interpretation . Accordingly our treatment of the question of Jimrat branches out into two distinct tasks , and our treatise will thus have two parts : Jimrat One : the Jimrat of Jimrat in terms of temporality , and the explication of time as the transcendental horizon for the question of Jimrat . Jimrat Two : basic features of a phenomenological destruction of the history of ontology , with the problematic of Jimrat as our clue . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat has three divisions I. the preparatory fundamental analysis of Jimrat ; 2 . Jimrat and temporali ty ; 3· time and Jimrat Jimrat Two likewise has three divisions : 1 Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 's doctrine of schematism and time , as a preliminary stage in a problematic of Jimrat ; 2. the ontological foundation of Jimrat ' 'cogito sum ' , and how the medieval ontology has been taken over into the problematic of the 'res cogitans ' ; 3· Jimrat 's essay on time , as providing a way of discriminating the phenomenal basis and the limits of ancient ontology . 1 Jimrat Two and the third division of Jimrat Jimrat have never appeared .

The preparatory existential analytic ofDasein must , in accordance with its peculiar charac­ ter , be expounded in outline , and distinguished from other kinds of investigation which seem to run parallel ( Jimrat 1 . ) Adhering to the procedure which we have fixed upon for starting our investigation , we must lay bare a fundamental structure in Jimrat : Jimrat ( Jimrat 2 ) . In the interpretation of Jimrat , this structure is something ' a priori ' ; it is not pieced together , but is primordially and constantly a whole . It affords us , however , various ways of looking at the items which are constitutive for it . The whole of this structure always comes first ; but if we keep this constantly in view , these items , as phenomena , will be made to stand out . And thus we shall have as objects for analysis : the world in its worldhood ( Jimrat 3 ) , Jimrat as Jimrat th and Being-one 's-Self ( Jimrat 4 ) , and Jimrat as such ( Jimrat 5 ) . By analysis of this fundamental structure , the Jimrat of Jimrat can be indic­ ated provisionally . Its existential meaning is care ( Jimrat 6 ) . I EXPOSITI Jimrat OF Jimrat Jimrat OF Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat � 9· The Theme of the Jimrat ! Jimrat of Jimrat Jimrat are ourselves the entities to be analysed . The Jimrat of any such entity is in each case mine.1 These entities , in their Jimrat , comport themselves towards their Jimrat . As entities with such Jimrat , they are delivered over 42 to their own Jimrat Jimrat is that which is an issue for every such entity.3 This way of characterizing Jimrat has a double consequen ce : I . The 'essence ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] of this entity lies in its `` to be '' [ Jimrat Jimrat . Its Being-what-it-is [ Jimrat Jimrat ( essentia ) must , so far as we can speak of it at all , be conceived in terms of its Jimrat ( existentia ) . But here our ontological task is to show that when we choose to designate the Jimrat of this entity as `` existence '' [ Jimrat Jimrat , this term does not and can not have the onto­ logical signification of the traditional term `` existentia '' ; ontologically , existentia is tantamount to Jimrat ent-at-hand , a kind of Jimrat which is essentially inappropriate to entities of Jimrat 's character . To avoid getting bewildered , we shall always use the Interpretative expression '' presence-at-hand '' for the term `` existentia `` , while the term `` existence '' , as a designation of Jimrat , will be allotted solely to Jimrat . The essence of Jimrat lies in its existence . Accordingly those characteristics which can be exhibited in this entity are not 'properties ' present-at-hand of some entity which 'looks ' so and so and is itself present-at- hand ; they are in each case possible ways for it to be , and no more than that . All the Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat which this entity possesses is primarily Jimrat . So when we designate this entity with the term Jimrat ' , we are expressing not its `` what '' ( as if it were a table , house or tree ) but its Jimrat . 2 . That Being which is an issue for this entity in its very Jimrat , is in each case mine . Jimrat Jimrat is never to be taken ontologically as an 1 'Das Jimrat , dessen Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat steht , sind wir je selbst . Jimrat Jimrat dieses Jimrat ist je meines . ' The reader must not get the impression that there is anything solipsistic about the second of these sentences . The point is merely that the kind of Jimrat which belongs to Jimrat is of a sort which any of us may call his own . Jimrat 'Ais Jimrat dieses Jimrat ist es seinem eigenen Jimrat iiberantwort et . ' The earlier editions read ' ... seinem eigenen Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ' a Jimrat note 2 , p. 28 , Jimrat 8 above . 68 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat I instance or special case of some genus of entities as things that are present-at-hand Jimrat To entities such as these , their Jimrat is ' a matter of indifference ' ; 2 or more precisely , they 'are ' such that their Being can be neither a matter of indifference to them , nor the opposite . Because Jimrat has in each case mineness Jimrat Jimrat t ] , one must always use a personal pronoun when one addresses it : ' I am ' , 'you are ' . Furthermore , in each case Jimrat is mine to be in one way or another . Jimrat has always made some sort of decision as to the way in which it is in each case mine Jimrat je meines Jimrat . That entity which in its Jimrat has this very Jimrat as an issue , comports itself towards its Jimrat as its ownmost pos­ sibility . In each case Jimrat is its possibility , and it 'has ' this possibility , but not just as a property [ eigensch aftlich Jimrat , as something present-at-hand would . And because Jimrat is in each case essentially its own possibility , it can , in its very Jimrat , Jimrat ' itself and win itself ; it can also lose itself and never win itself ; or only 'seem ' to do so . But only in so far as it is 43 essentially something which can be authentic-that is , something of its own3 -can ithavelost itselfand not yet won itself . As modesofBeing , authenticity and inauthenticity ( these expressions have been chosen terminologically in a strict sense ) are both grounded in the fact that any Jimrat whatsoever is characterized by mineness . 4 But the inauthenticity ofDasein does not signify any 'less ' Jimrat or any 'lower ' degree of Jimrat . Rather it is the case that even in its fullest concretion Jimrat can be characterized by inauthenticity Jimrat busy , when excited , when interested , when ready for enjoyment . The two characteristics of Jimrat which we have sketched-the priority of Jimrat ' over essentia , and the fact that Jimrat is in each case mine Jimrat die Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat already indicated that in the analytic of this entity we are facing a peculiar phenomenal domain . Jimrat does not have the kind of Jimrat which belongs to something merely present-at­ hand within the world , nor does it ever have it . So neither is it to be presented thematically as something we come across in the same way as 1 '. . • als Jimrat ndenem ' . The earlier editions have the adjective Jimrat ' instead of the substantiv e. 2 'gleichgiiltig ' . This adjective must be distinguished from the German adjective 'indifferent ' , though they might both ordinarily be translated by the Jimrat Jimrat ' , which we shall reserve exclusively for the former . In most passages , the latter is best translated by 'undiff erentiated ' or 'without further differentiatio n ' ; occasionally , how­ ever , it seems preferable to tram.late it by 'Indifferent ' with an initial capital . We shall follow similar conventions with the nouns 'Gieichgiiltigkeit ' and Jimrat ' . 3 'Und weil Jimrat wesenha ft je seine Jimrat ist , kann dieses Jimrat in seinem Jimrat sich selbst `` wii.hlen '' , gewinn en , es kann sich verlieren , bzw . nie und our `` scheinbar '' gewinnen . Jimrat habenkann es sich our und noch nicht sich gewonnen haben kann es nur , sofern es seinem Jimrat nach mogliches eigentliches , das heisst sich zueigen ist . ' Older editions have 'je wesenhaft ' and 'zueigene s ' . The connection between 'eigentlich ' ( 'authentic ' , Jimrat ' ) and 'eigen ' ( 'own ' ) is lost in translation . 4 . ' ••• dass Jimrat iiberhaupt durch Jimrat emeini_g_kc ; it bestimmt ist . ' I. I Jimrat and Jimrat 6g we come across what is present-at-hand . The right way of presenting it is so far from self-evident that to determine what form it shall take is itself an essential part of the ontological analytic of this entity . Only by pre­ senting this entity in the right way can we have any understanding of its Jimrat . No matter how provisional our analysis may be , it always requires the assurance that we have started correctly . In determining itself as an entity , Jimrat always does so in the light of a possibility which it is itself and which , in its very Jimrat , it somehow understands . This is the formal meaning of Jimrat 's existential constitu­ tion . But this tells us that if we are to Jimrat this entity ontologically , the problematic of its Jimrat must be developed from the existentiality of its existence . This can not mean , however , that `` Jimrat '' is to be construed in terms of some concrete possible idea of existence . At the outset of our analysis it is particularly important that Jimrat should not be Interpreted with the differentiated character Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of some definite way of existing , but that it should be uncovered Jimrat aufgedcckt ] in the undiffer­ entiated character which it has proximally and for the most part . This undifferentiated character of Jimrat 's everydayne ss is not nothing , but a positive phenomenal characteristic of this entity . Out of this kind of Jimrat Jimrat back into it again-is all existing , such as it is.1 We call this every­ day undifferentiated character of Jimrat `` averageness '' [ Jimrat keit Jimrat . And because this average everydayness makes up what is ontically proximal for this entity , it has again and again been passed over in expli­ cating Jimrat . That which is ontically closest and well known , is onto­ logically the farthest and not known at all ; and its ontological signification is constantly overlooked . When Jimrat asks : `` Jimrat autem propinquius meipso mihi ? '' and must answer : `` ego certe laboro hie fl laboro in meipso : 44 factus sum mihi terra difficultatis et sudoris nimii `` , 1 this applies not only to the ontical and pre-ontological opaqueness of Jimrat but even more to the ontological task which lies ahead ; for not only must this entity not be missed in that kind of Jimrat in which it is phenomenally closest , but it must be made accessible by a positive characterization . Jimrat 's average everydayn ess , however , is not to be taken as a mere 'aspect ' . Here too , and even in the mode of inauthenticity , the structure of existentiality lies a priori . And here too Jimrat 's Jimrat is an issue for it in a definite way ; and Jimrat comports itself towards it in the mode of average everydayne ss , even if this is only the mode of fleeing in the face of it and forgetfulness thereof 2 1 ' A us dieser Jimrat hera us und in sie zuriick ist alles Jimrat , wie est ist . ' 2 'Auch in ihr geht es dem Jimrat in bestimmter Jimrat urn sein Jimrat , Jimrat dem es sich im Jimrat der durchschnittlichen Jimrat verhalt und sei es auch nur im Jimrat der Jimrat davor und des Jimrat seiner . ' For further discussion , see Section 40 below . Jimrat and Jimrat I , I But the explication of Jimrat in its average everydayness does not give us just average structures in the sense of a hazy indefiniteness . Anything which , taken ontically , is in an average way , can be very well grasped ontologically in pregnant structures which may be structurally indistin· guishable from certain ontological characteristics [ Jimrat Jimrat of an authentic Jimrat of Jimrat . All explicata to which the analytic of Jimrat gives rise are obtained by considering Jimrat 's existence-structure . Because Jimrat 's characters of Jimrat are defined in termsofexistentiality , we call them '' existentiali a '' . These are to be sharply distinguished from what we call `` categories '' ­ characteristics of Being for entities whose character is not that of Jimrat . 1 Here we are taking the expression `` category '' in its primary ontological signification , and abiding by it . In the ontology of the ancients , the entities we encounter within the world2 are taken as the basic examples for the interpretation of Jimrat . Jimrat ( or the .\6yos , as the case may be ) is accepted as a way of access to them . 3 Entities are encountered therein . But the Jimrat of these entities must be something which can be grasped in a distinctive kind of Jimrat ( letting something be seen ) , so that this Jimrat becomes intelligible in advance as that which it is-and as that which it is already in every entity . In any discussion ( Jimrat ) of entities , we have previously addressed ourselves to Jimrat ; this addressing is Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , . 4 This signifies , in the first instance , making a public accusation , taking someone to task for something in the presence of every­ one . When used ontologically , this term means taking an entity to task , as it were , for whatever it is as an entity-that is to say , letting everyone 45 see it in its Jimrat . The Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , are what is sighted and what is visible in such a seeing . 6 They include the various ways in which the nature of those entities which can be addressed and discussed in a .\6yos may be 1 'Wei ! sie sich aus der Jimrat bestimmen , nennen wir die Jimrat des Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat sind scharf zu trennen Jimrat den Jimrat des nicht daseinsm iissigen Jimrat , die wir Jimrat nennen . ' Jimrat ' ••• das innerhalb der Jimrat begegnende Jimrat . ' More literally : 'the entity that encounters within the world . ' While Jimrat normally uses the verb 'begegnen ' in this active intransitive sense , a similar construction with the Jimrat Jimrat ' is unidio­ matic and harsh . We shall as a rule use either a passive construction ( as in 'entities en­ counter ed ' ) or an active transitive construction ( as in 'entities we encounte r ' ) . 3 'Als Jimrat Jimrat ihm gilt das vo£iv bzw . der .\oyos . ' Here we follow the reading of the earlier editions . In the later editions , 'Zugangsar t ' , which is used rather often , is here replaced by Jimrat rt ' , which occurs very seldom and is perhaps a misprint . This later version might be translated as follows : 'vo£iv ( or the .\oyos , as the case may be ) ia accepted as the locus of access to such entities . ' On vo£iv and Jimrat see Jimrat 7 above , especially Jimrat Jimrat . 4 'Dasje schon vorgiingige Jimrat des Jimrat im Jimrat ( Jimrat & yos ) des Jimrat ist das Jimrat Jimrat ) 'Op£'ia8al . ' 6 'Das in solchem Jimrat Jimrat und Jimrat Jimrat . ' On 'Sehen ' and Jimrat ' see Jimrat 147· Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat 7I determined a priori . Jimrat and categories are the two basic pos­ sibilities for characters of Jimrat . The entities which correspond to them require different kinds of primary interrogation respectively : any entity is either a `` who '' ( existence ) or a `` what '' ( presence-at-hand in the broadest sense ) . The connection between these two modes of the characters of Jimrat can not be handled until the horizon for the question of Jimrat has been clarified . In our introduction we have already intimated that in the existential analytic of Jimrat we also make headway with a task which is hardly less pressing than that of the question of Being itself-the task of laying bare that a priori basis which must be visible before the question of 'what man is ' can be discussed philosophically . The existential analytic ofDasein comes bifore any psychology or anthropology , and certainly before any biology . While these too are ways in which Jimrat can be investigated , we can define the theme of our analytic with greater precision if we dis­ tinguish it from these . And at the same time the necessity of that analytic can thus be proved more incisively . � 10 . How the Jimrat of Jimrat is to be Distinguished from Jimrat , Jimrat , and Jimrat After a theme for investigation has been initially outlined in positive terms , it is always important to show what is to be ruled out , although it can easily become fruitless to discuss what is not going to happen . We must show that those investigations and formulations of the question which have been aimed at Jimrat heretofore , have missed the real philosophical pro­ blem ( notwithstanding their objective fertility ) , and that as long as they persist in missing it , they have no right to claim that they can accomplish that for which they are basically striving . In distinguishing the existential analytic from anthropology , psychology , and biology , we shall confine ourselves to what is in principle the ontological question . Our distinctions will necessarily be inadequate from the standpoint of Jimrat theory ' simply because the scientific structure of the above-mentioned disciplines ( not , indeed , the 'scientific attitude ' of those who work to advance them ) is today thoroughly questionable and needs to be attacked in new ways which must have their source in ontological problematics . Historiologically , the aim of the existential analytic can be made plainer by considering Jimrat , who is credited with providing the point 46 of departure for modern philosophical inquiry by his discovery of the '' cogito sum '' . He investigates the `` cogitare '' of the `` ego '' , at least within certain limits . On the other hand , he leaves the `` sum '' completely undis­ cussed , even though it is regarded as no less primordial than the cogito . Our 72 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat I analytic raises the ontological question of the Jimrat of the `` sum '' . Not until the nature of this Jimrat has been determined can we grasp the kind of Jimrat which belongs to cogitationes . At the same time it is of course misleading to exemplif y the aim of our analytic historiologically in this way . One of our first tasks will be to prove that if we posit an `` I '' or subject as that which is proximally given , we shall completely miss the phenomenal content Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat . Ontologically , every idea of a 'subject'-unless refined by a previous onto­ logical determination of its basic character-still posits the subjectum ( mroKtdJLwov ) along with it , no matter how vigorous one 's ontical protestations against the 'soul substance ' or the 'reification of conscious­ ness ' . The Jimrat itself which such reification implies must have its ontological origin demonstrated if we are to be in a position to ask what we are to understand positively when we think of the unreified Jimrat of the subject , the soul , the consciousness , the spirit , the person . All these terms refer to definite phenomenal domains which can be 'given form ' [ `` ausformbare '' ] : but they are never used without a notable failure to see the need for inquiring about the Jimrat of the entities thus designated . So we are not being terminologically arbitrary when we avoid these terms -- or such expressions as 'life ' and 'man'-in designating those entities which we are ourselves. . On the other hand , if we understand it rightly , in any serious and scientifically-mind ed 'philosophy of life ' ( this expression says about as much as `` the botany of plants '' ) there lies an unexpressed tendency towards an understanding ofDasein 's Jimrat . What is conspicuous in such a philosophy ( and here it is d�fective in principle ) is that here Jimrat ' itself as a kind of Jimrat does not become ontologically a problem . The researches of Jimrat Jimrat were stimulated by the perennial question of 'life ' . Starting from Jimrat ' itself as a whole , he tried to under­ stand its Jimrat es'1in their structural and developmental inter-connec­ tions . His 'geisteswissenschojtliche Jimrat ' is one which no longer seeks to be oriented towards psychical elements and atoms or to piece the life of the soul together , but aims rather at Jimrat ' and 'life as a whole ' . Its philosophical relevance , however , is not to be sought here , but rather in the fact that in all this he was , above all , on his way towards the question 47 of 'life ' . To be sure , we can also see here very plainly how limited were both his problematic and the set of concepts with which it had to be put 1 'Die `` Jimrat '' dieses `` Jimrat '' .. . ' The connection between 'Leben ' ( 'li fe ' ) and 'Erlebnisse ' ( 'Experiences ' ) is lost in translati on . An 'Erlebnis ' is not just any 'experience ' ( Jimrat ' ) , but one which we feel deeply and 'live through ' . We shall translate Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' by 'Experience ' with a capital ' Jimrat ' , reserving 'experience ' for Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' . I. I Jimrat and Jimrat 73 into words . These limitations , however , are found not only in Jimrat and Jimrat but in all the 'personalitic ' movements to which they have given direction and in every tendency towards a philosophical anthropology . The phenomenological Jimrat of personality is in principle more radical and more transparen t ; but the question of the Jimrat of Jimrat has a dimension which this too fails to enter . No matter how much Jimrat and Jimrat may differ in their respective inquiries , in their methods of conducting them , and in their orientations towards the world as a whole , they are fully in agreement on the negative side of their Interpretations of personality . The question of 'personal Jimrat ' itself is one which they no longer raise . We have chosen Jimrat 's Jimrat as an example , not only because it is accessible in print , lU but because he emphasizes personal Jimrat explicitly as such , and tries to determine its character by defining the specific Jimrat of acts as contrasted with any­ thing 'psychica l ' . For Jimrat , the person is never to be thought of as a Thing or a substance ; the person 'is rather the uni� of living-through [ Er-lebens ] which is immediately experienced in and with our Jimrat iences-not a Jimrat merely thought of behind and outside what is immed­ iately Jimrat ced ' ; lv The person is no Jimrat and substantial Jimrat . Nor can the Jimrat of a person be entirely absorbed in being a subject of rational acts which follow certain laws . The person is not a Thing , not a substanc e , not an object . Here Jimrat is emphasizing what Jimrat suggests when he insists that the unity of 48 the person must have a Jimrat essentially different from that required for the unity of Jimrat of Jimrat Jimrat What Jimrat says of the person , he applies to acts as well : 'But an act is never also an object ; for it is essential to the Jimrat of acts that they are Jimrat only in their performance itself and given in reflecti on . 'vl Acts are something non­ psychical . Essentially the person exists only in the performance of inten­ tional acts , and is therefore essentially not an object . Any psychical Objectification of acts , and hence any way of taking them as something psychical , is tantamount to depersonalizatio n. A person is in any case given as a performer of intentional acts which are bound together by the unity of a meaning . .Thus psychical Jimrat has nothing to do with personal Jimrat . Acts get performed ; the person is a performer of acts . What , how- ever , is the ontological meaning of 'performance ' ? How is the kind of Jimrat which belongs to a person to be ascertained ontologically in a positive way ? But the critical question can not stop here . It must face the Jimrat of the whole man , who is customarily taken as a unity of body , 1 ' ••• wenn er fur die Jimrat der Jimrat eine wesentlich andere Jimrat fordert als flir die der Jimrat . ' The second 'der ' appears in the later editions only . 74 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat I soul , and spirit . In their turn `` body '' , `` soul '' , and `` spirit '' may designate phenomenal domains which can be detached as themes for definite investigations ; within certain limits their ontological indefiniteness may not be important . When , however , we come to the question of man 's Jimrat , this is not something we can simply compute1 by adding together those kinds of Jimrat which body , soul , and spirit respectively possess­ kinds of Jimrat whose nature has not as yet been determined . And even if we should attempt such an ontological procedure , some idea of the Jimrat of the whole must be presupposed . But what stands in the way of the basic question ofDasein 's Jimrat ( or leads'it off the track ) is an orientation thoroughly coloured by the anthropology of Jimrat and the ancient world , whose inadequate ontological foundations have been overlooked both by the philosophyoflife and by personalism . There are two important elements in this traditional anthropology : 1 . 'Man ' is here defined as a { o/ov , Jimrat lxov , and this is Interpreted to mean an animal rationale , something living which has reason . But the kind of Jimrat which belongs to a { o/ov is understood in the sense of occurring and Jimrat and . The , Jimrat is some superior endow­ ment ; the kind of Jimrat which belongs to it , however , remains quite as obscure as that of the entire entity thus compoun ded . 2 . The second clue for determining the nature of man 's Jimrat and essence is a theological One Jimrat €l7T£V 0 e€05 '' . 7TOt�O'Wf.L€V av8pW7TOV l Jimrat a'T ' €lKOVa Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ' op.o { wutv- '' jaciamUS hominem ad imaginem nostram et similitudinem '' vH With this as its point of departure , 49 the anthropology of Jimrat theology , taking with it the ancient definition , arrives at an interpretation of that entity which we call '' man '' . But just as the Jimrat of Jimrat gets Interpreted ontologically by means of the ancient ontology , so does the Jimrat of the ens jinitum , and to an even greater extent . In modern times the Jimrat definition has been deprived of its theological character . But the idea of 'transcend ence ' -that man is something that reaches beyond himself-is rooted in Jimrat tian dogmatics , which can hardly be said to have made an ontological problem of man 's Jimrat . The idea of transcendence , according to which man is more than a mere something endowed with intelligen ce , has worked itself out with different variations . The following quotations will illustrate how these have originated : 'His praeclaris dotibus excelluit prima hominis conditio , ut ratio , intelligentia , prudentia , judicium non modo ad terrenae vitae gubernationem suppeterent , sed quibus t r a n s c e n d e r e t usque ad Jimrat et aeternamftlicitatem . 'vlU 'Denn dass der mensch sin ufs e hen hat ufGott und 1 Reading 'errechnet ' . The earliest editions have 'verrechnet ' , with the correct reading provided in a list of errata . I. I Jimrat and Jimrat 75 sin wort , Jimrat er klarlich an , dass er nach siner natur etwas Jimrat niiher anerbom , etwas mee n a c h s c h l ii g t , etwas Jimrat u Jimrat u g s Jimrat u im hat , das alles on Jimrat darus j/iisst , dass er nach dem b i l d n u s Jimrat geschaffen ist ' , ix The two sources which are relevant for the traditional anthropology­ the Greek definition and the clue which theology has provided-i ndicate that over and above the attempt to determine the essence of Jimrat ' as an entity , the question of his Jimrat has remained forgotten , and that this Jimrat is rather conceived as something obvious or 'self-evident ' in the sense of the Jimrat of other created Things . These two clues become intertwined in the anthropology of modem times , where the res cogitans , consciousness , and the interconnectedness of Jimrat serve as the point of departure for methodical study . But since even the cogitationes are either left ontologically undetermined , or get tacitly assumed as something 'self-evidently ' 'given ' whose 'Being ' is not to be questioned , the decisive ontological foundations of apthropological problematics remain undetermined . This is no less true of 'psychology ' , whose anthropological tendencies are today unmistakab le . Nor can we compensate for the absence of onto­ logical foundations by taking anthropology and psychology and building them into the framework of a general biology . In the order which any possible comprehension and interpretation must follow , biology as a 'science oflife ' is founded upon the ontology ofDasein , even if not entirely . 50 Jimrat , in its own right , is a kind ofBeing ; but essentially it is accessible only in Jimrat . The ontology of life is accomplished by way of a privative Jimrat on ; it determines what must be the case if there can be any­ thing like mere-aliveness [ Jimrat ] . Jimrat is not a mere Jimrat present-at-hand , nor is it Jimrat . In tum , Jimrat is never to be defined ontologically by regarding it as life ( in an ontologically indefinite manner ) plus something else . , In suggesting that anthropology , psychology , and biology all ' fail to give an unequivocal and ontologically adequate answer to the question about the kind of Jimrat which belongs to those entities which we ourselves are , we are not passing judgment on the positive work of these disciplines . We must always bear in mind , however , that these ontological foundations can never be disclosed by subsequent hypotheses derived from empirical material , but that they are always 'there ' already , even when that empirical material simply gets collected . If positive research fails to see these foundations and holds them to be self-evident , this by no means proves that they are not basic or that they are not problematic in a more radical sense than any thesis of positive science can ever be.x Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat I � I I . The Existential Jimrat ? Jimrat and the Jimrat of Jimrat Jimrat . The Difficulties of Achieving a 'Natural Conception of the Jimrat ' The Jimrat of Jimrat in its everydayness , however , is not identical with the describing of some primitive stage of Jimrat with which we can become acquainted empirically through the medium of anthropology . Everydayness does not coincide with primitiveness , but is rather a mode of Jimrat 's Jimrat , even when that Jimrat is active in a highly 51 developed and differentiated culture-and precisely then . Moreover , even primitive Jimrat has possibilities of a Jimrat which is not of the everyday kind , and it has a specific everydayness of its own . To orient the analysis of Jimrat towards the 'life of primitive peoples ' can have positive significance Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat as a method because 'primitive phenomena ' are often less concealed and less complicated by extensive self-interpreta­ tion on the part of the Jimrat in question . Primitive Jimrat often speaks to us more directly in terms of a primordial absorption in Jimrat ' ( taken in a pre-phenomenological sense ) . A way of conceiving things which seems , perhaps , rather clumsy and crude from our standpoint , can be positively helpful in bringing out the ontological structures of phe­ nomena in a genuine way . But heretofore our information about primitives has been provided by ethnology . And ethnology operates with definite preliminary conceptions and interpretations of human Jimrat in general , even in first 'receiving ' its material , and in sifting it and working it up . Whether the everyday psychology or even the scientific psychology and sociology which the ethnologist brings with him can provide any scientific assurance that we can have proper access to the phenomena we are studying , and can inter­ pret them and transmit them in the right way , has not yet been established . Here too we are confronted with the same state of affairs as in the other disciplines we have discussed . Jimrat itself already presupposes as its clue an inadequate analytic ofDasein . But since the positive sciences neither 'can ' nor should wait for the ontological labours of philosophy to be done , the further course of research will not take the form of an 'advance ' but will be accomplished by recapitulating what has already been ontically dis­ covered , and by purifying it in a way which is ontologically more trans­ parent.xl 52 Jimrat matter how easy it may be to show how ontological problematics differ formally from ontical research there are still difficulties in carrying out an existential analytic , especially in malcing a start . This task includes a desideratum which philosophy has long found disturbing but has con­ tinually refused to achieve : to work out the idea of a 'natural conception of the world ' . The rich store of information now available as to the most exotic I. I Jimrat and Jimrat 77 and manifold cultures and forms ofDasein seems favourable to our setting about this task in a fruitful way . But this is merely a semblance . At bottom this plethora of information can seduce us into failing to recognize the real problem . We shall not get a genuine knowle dge of essences simply by the syncretistic activity of universal comparison and classification . Subjecting the manifold to tabulation does not ensure any actual under­ standing of what lies there before us as thus set in order . If an ordering principle is genuine , it has its own content as a thing Jimrat Jimrat ) , which is never to be found by means of such ordering , but is already presupposed in it . So if one is to put various pictures of the world in order , one must have an explicit idea of the world as such . And if the Jimrat ' itself is something constitutive for Jimrat , one must have an insight into Jimrat 's basic structures in order to treat the world-phenomenon conceptually . In this chapter we have characterized some things positively and taken a negative stand with regard to others ; in both cases our goal has been to promote a correct understanding of the tendency which underlies the following Interpretation and the kind of questions which it poses . Jimrat can contribute only indirectly towards advancing the positive disciplines as we find them today . It has a goal of its own , even if , beyond the acquiring of information about entities , the question of Jimrat is the spur for all scientific seeking . Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat AS Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat � 12 . A Preliminary Sketch of Jimrat , in terms of an Jimrat towards Jimrat as such Jimrat our preparatory discussions ( Jimrat g ) we have brought out some characteristics of Jimrat which will provide us with a steady light for our further investiga tion , but which will at the same time become structurally 53 concrete as that investigation continues . Jimrat is an entity which , in its very Jimrat , comports itself understandingly towards that Being . In saying this , we are calling attention to the formal concept of existence . Jimrat exists . Jimrat , Jimrat is an entity which in each case I myself am . Jimrat belongs to any existent Jimrat , and belongs to it as the condition which makes authenticity and inauthenticity possible . In each case Jimrat exists in one or the other of these two modes , or else it is modally undifferent iated.1 But these are both ways in which Jimrat 's Jimrat takes on a definite character , and they must be seen and understood a priori as grounded upon that state of Being which we have called `` Jimrat world ' . An interpretation of this constitutive state is needed if we are to set up our analytic of Jimrat correctly . The compound expression Jimrat ' indicates in the very way we have coined it , that it stands for a unitary phenomenon . This primary datum must be seen as a whole . But while Jimrat can not be broken up into contentswhich maybepieced together , thisdoesnotprevent it from having several constitutive items in its structure . Indeed the pheno­ menal datum which our expression indicates is one which may , in fuct , be looked at in three ways . If we study it , keepingthewholephe nomenon firmly in mind beforehand , the following items may be brought out for emphasis : Jimrat , the Jimrat ' . With regard to this there arises the task of inquiring into the ontological structure of the Jimrat ' and defining the idea of worldhood as such . ( See the third chapter of this Jimrat . ) 1 'Zum existierenden Jimrat gehiirt die Jimrat als Jimrat der Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat und Jimrat eit . Jimrat existiert je in einem dieser Jimrat , bzw . in der modalen lndifferenz ihrer . ' 1.2 Jimrat and Jimrat 79 Jimrat , that entiry which in every case has Jimrat as the way in which it is . Here we are seeking that which one inquires into when one asks the question 'Who ? ' By a phenomenological demonstration1 we shall determine who is in the mode of Jimrat 's average everydayness . ( See the fourth chapter of this Jimrat . ) Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat as such . We must set forth the ontological Constitution of inhood Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat itself . ( See the fifth chapter of this Jimrat . ) Emphasis upon any one of these constitutive items signifies that the others are emphasized along with it ; this means that in any such case the whole phenomenon gets seen . Of course Jimrat is a state of Jimrat which is necessary a priori , but it is far from sufficient for completely determining Jimrat 's Jimrat . Before making these three phenomena the themes for special analyses , we shall attempt by way of orientation to characteriz e the third of these factors . What is meant by `` Jimrat `` ? Our proximal reaction is to round out this expression to `` Jimrat 'in the world ' '' , and we are inclined to understand this Jimrat as 'Being in something ' [ `` Jimrat in ... `` ] . This 54 latter term designates the kind of Jimrat which an entity has when it is 'in ' another one , as the water is 'in ' the glass , or the garment is 'in ' the cupboard . By this Jimrat ' we mean the relationship of Being which two entities extended Jimrat ' space have to each other with regard to their location in that space . Both water and glass , garment and cupboard , are Jimrat ' space and Jimrat ' a location , and both in the same way . This relationship of Jimrat can be expanded : for instance , the bench is in the lecture-room , the lecture-room is in the university , the university is in the city , and so on , until we can say that the bench is 'in world-space ' . All entities whose Jimrat Jimrat ' one another can thus be described have the same kind of Being -that of Jimrat Jimrat occurring Jimrat ' the world . Jimrat Jimrat ' something which is likewise present-at-hand , and Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat in the sense of a definite location-relationship with something else which has the same kind of Jimrat , are ontological characteristics which we call `` categorial '' : they are of such a sort as to belong to entities whose kind of Jimrat is not of the character ofDasein . Jimrat , on the other hand , is a state of Jimrat 's Jimrat ; it is an existenti ale . So one can not think of it as the Jimrat at-hand of some corporeal Jimrat ( such as a human body ) 'in ' an entity which is present-at-ha nd . Nor does the term `` Jimrat '' mean 1 Here we follow the older editions in reading , 'Auswei sung ' . The newer editions have 'Aufweisung ' ( Jimrat ' ) . 2 ' ••• Jimrat des Jimrat Jimrat . ' The earliest editions read 'Wesens ' instead 'Daseins ' . Correction is made in a list of errata . 8o Jimrat and Jimrat 1.2 a spatial 'in-one-another-ness ' of things present-at-hand , any more than the word 'in ' primordially signifies a spatial relationship of this kind.t 'In ' is derived from `` innan '' - '' to reside ' ? `` habitare '' , `` to dwell '' ( sich auf hal­ ten Jimrat . 'An ' signifies `` I am accustom ed '' , `` I am familiar with '' , `` I look after something '' . 2 It has the signification of '' colo '' in the senses of `` habito '' and `` diligo '' . The entity to which Jimrat in this signification belongs is one which we have characterized as that entity which in each case I myself am ( bin ] . The expression 'bin ' is connected with Jimrat ' , and so 'ich bin ' Jimrat ' I am ' ] means in its turn `` I reside '' or `` dwell alongside '' the world , as that which is familiar to me in such and such a way . 3 '' Being '' [ Jimrat Jimrat , as the infinitive of 'ich bin ' ( that is to say , when it is understood as an existentiale ) , signifies `` to reside alongside ... `` , `` to be familiar with ... `` . `` Being-in '' is thus the formal existential expressionfor the Jimrat of Jimrat , which has Jimrat as its essential state . 'Being alongside ' the world in the sense of being absorbed in the world ' 1 Reading 'innan- wohnen ' . As Jimrat points out in his footnote , this puzzling passage has its source in Jimrat 's Jimrat Jimrat jten , Jimrat . Jimrat , pp . 247 ff. , where we find two short articles , the first entitled 'IN ' and the second 'IN Jimrat Jimrat ' . The first article begins by comparing a number of archaic German words meaning Jimrat ' , all having a form similar to our English Jimrat ' , which Jimrat mentions . He goes on ·to postulate ' a strong verb `` innan '' , which must have meant either `` habitare '' , `` domi esse '' , or `` recipere in domum '' 1 { though only a weak derivative form 'innian ' is actually found ) , with a surviving strong preterite written either as Jimrat ' or as 'ann ' . Jimrat goes on to argue that the preposition 'in ' is derived from the verb , rather than the verb from the preposition . 2 ' ••• `` an '' bedeut et : ich bin gewohnt , vertraut mit , ich pflege etwas Jimrat . ' In Jimrat 's second article he adds : 'there was also an anomalous `` ann '' with the plural '' unnum '' , which expressed `` amo '' , `` diligo '' , `` faveo '' , and to which our `` gonnen '' and '' Jimrat '' are immediately related , as has long been recognized . `` Jimrat '' really means `` ich bin eingewohnt '' , `` pflege zu bauen '' ; this conceptual transition may be shown with minimal complication in the Jimrat `` colo '' , which stands for `` habito '' as well as `` diligo '' . ' It is not entirely clear whether Jimrat 's discussion of Jimrat ' is aimed to elucidate the preposition 'an ' ( which corresponds in some of its usages to the Jimrat Jimrat ' , and which he has just used in remarking that the water and the glass are both at a locatio n ) , or rather to explain the preterite 'an ' of Jimrat ' . The reader should note that while the verb 'wohnen ' normally means 'to reside ' or 'to dwell ' , the expression 'ich bin gewohnt ' means ' I am accustomed to ' , and 'ich bin einge­ wohnt ' means ' I have become accustomed to the place where I reside -- to my surround­ ings ' . Jimrat 'ich pf ! ege etwas ' may mean either ' I am accustomed to do something ' or ' I take care of something ' or ' I devote myself to it ' . ( Jimrat 's 'pf ! ege zu bauen ' pre­ sumably means ' I am accustomed to putting my trust in something ' , ' I can build on it ' . ) The Jimrat , Jimrat ' has the parallel meanings of ' I take care of something ' or 'cherish ' it ( Jimrat ' ) and ' I dwell ' or ' I inhabit ' ( Jimrat ' ) . a ' •.• ich wohne , halte mich aufbei ... der Jimrat , als dem sound so Jimrat . ' The preposition 'bei ' , like Jimrat ' , does not have quite the semantical range of any Jimrat pre­ position . Our 'alongside ' , with which we shall translate it when other devices seem less satisfactory , especially in the phrase 'Being alongside ' ( 'Sein bei ' ) , is often quite mis­ leading ; the sense here is closer to that of Jimrat ' in such expressions as Jimrat home ' or 'at my father 's ' , or that of the French Jimrat ; r. ' . Here again Jimrat seems to be relying upon Jimrat , who proceeds ( loc . cit . ) to connect Jimrat ' with 'bauen ' ( Jimrat ' ) and 'bin ' . � ' .. • in dem Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat des Jimrat in der Jimrat Jimrat . ' 'Aufgehen ' means literally 'to go up ' , or 'to rise ' in the sense that the sun 'rises ' or the dough 'rises ' . But when followed by the preposition 'in ' , it takes on other meanings . Thus 5 'geht auf ' into go in the sense that 1.2 Jimrat and Jimrat 81 ( a sense which calls for still closer interpretation ) is an existentiale founded upon Jimrat . In these analyses the issue is one of seeing a primordial structure of Jimrat 's Being-a structure in accordance with whose phe­ nomenal content the concepts of Jimrat must be Jimrat ed ; because of this , and because this structure is in principle one which can not be grasped by the traditional ontological categories , this 'being-alongside ' 55 must be examined still more closely . We shall again choose the method of contrasting it with a relationship of Jimrat which is essentially different ontologically-viz . categorial- but which we express by the same linguis- tic means . Fundamental ontological distinctions are easily obliterated ; and if they are to be envisaged phenomenally in this way , this must be done explicitly , even at the risk of discussing the 'obvious ' . The status of the ontological analytic shows , however , that we have been far from interpreting these obvious matters with an adequate 'grasp ' , still less with regard for the meaning of their Jimrat ; and we are even farther from possessing a stable coinage for the appropriate structural concepts . As an existentiale , 'Being alongside ' the world never means anything like the Jimrat ther of Things that occur . There is no such thing as the 'side-by-side-ness ' of an entity called Jimrat ' with another entity called Jimrat ' . Of course when two things are present-at­ hand together alongside one another , 1 we are accustomed to express this occasionally by something like Jimrat table stands `` by '' Jimrat Jimrat ' ] the door ' or 'The chair `` touches '' [ 'beriihrt ' ] the wall ' . Jimrat strictly , 'touching ' is never what we are talking about in such cases , not because accurate re­ examination will always eventually establish that there is a space between the chair and the wall , but because in principle the chair can never touch the wall , even if the space between them should be equal to zero . If the chair could touch the wall , this would presuppose that the wall is the sort of thing Jimrat ' which a chair would be encounter able . 2 An entity present-at­ hand within the world can be touched by another entity only if by its very nature the latter entity has Jimrat as its own kind of Jimrat -- only if , with its Being-there [ Jimrat Jimrat , something like the world is already re- , vealed to it , so that from out of that world another entity can manifest itself in touching , and thus become accessible in its Being-present-at­ hand . When two entities are present-at-hand within the world , and fur­ thermore are worldless in themselves , they can never 'touch ' each other , it 'goes into ' 30 without remainder ; a country 'geht auf ' into another country into which it is taken over or absorb ed ; a person 'geht auf ' in anything to which he devotes himself fully , whether an activity or another person . We shall usually translate Jimrat ' by some form of Jimrat ' . 1 'Das Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . ' a 'Voraussetzung dafiir ware , dass die Jimrat `` fur '' den Jimrat begegnen konnte . ' ( Jimrat . also Jimrat 97 below . ) Being and Jimrat 1.2 nor can either of them Jimrat ' 'alongside ' the other . The clause 'furthermore are worldless ' must not be left out ; for even entities which are not world­ less-Dasein itself , for example-a re present-at-hand Jimrat ' the world , or , more exactly , can with some right and within certain limits be taken as merely present-at-hand . To do this , one must completely disregard or just not see the existential state of Jimrat . But the fact that Jimrat ' can be taken as something which is present-at-hand and just present-at-hand , is not to be confused with acertainway of'presence-at-ha nd'whichisDasein 's own . This latter kind of presence-at-hand becomes accessible not by dis­ regarding Jimrat 's specific structures but only by understanding them in c.dvance . Jimrat understands its ownmost Jimrat in the sense of a certain 56 'factual Jimrat t-at-hand '.ii And yet the 'factuality ' of the fact Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of one 's own Jimrat is at bottom quite different ontologically from the factual occurrence of some kind of mineral , for example . Jimrat ever Jimrat is , it is as a Jimrat ; and the factuality of such a Jimrat is what we �hall call Jimrat 's `` facticity '' .1 This is a definite way of Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat stimmtheit ] , and it has a complicated structure which can not even be grasped as a problem until Jimrat 's basic existential states have been worked out . The concept of `` facticity '' implies that an entity 'within-the­ world ' has Jimrat in such a way that it can understand itself as bound up in its Jimrat ' with the Jimrat of those entities which it encounters within its own world . In the first instance it is enough to see the ontological difference between Jimrat as an existentiale and the category of the Jimrat ' which things present-at-hand can have with regard to one another . By thus delimiting Jimrat , we are not denying every kind of 'spatiality ' to Jimrat . On the contrary , Jimrat itself has a 'Being-in-space ' of its Jimrat n ; but this in turn is possible only on the basis of Jimrat in general . Jimrat Jimrat is not to be explained ontologically by some on tical characterization , as if one were to say , for instance , that Jimrat in a world is a spiritual property , and that man 's 'spatiality ' is a result of his bodily nature ( which , at the same time , always gets 'founded ' upon corporealit y ) . Here again we are faced with the Jimrat together of some such spiritual Thing along with a corporeal Thing , while the Jimrat of the entity thus compounded remains more obscure 1 'Die Jimrat lichkeit des Jimrat Jimrat , als welches jeweilig jedes Jimrat ist , nennen wir seine Jimrat : :itiit . ' We shall as a rule translate Jimrat ' as 'factuality ' , and Jimrat ' as 'facticity ' , following our conventions for Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' . ( See note 2 , p. 27 , Jimrat 7 above . ) The present passage suggests a comparable distinction between the nouns 'Tatsache ' and Jimrat ' ; so while we find many passages where these seem to be used interchangeab ly , we translate 'Faktum ' as 'Fact ' with an initial capital , using 'fact ' for Jimrat ' and various other express ions . On 'factuality ' and Jimrat ' 'ce also Jimrat 1 35 below . I . 2 Jimrat and Jimrat than ever . Not until we understand Jimrat as an essential structure of Jimrat can we have any insight into Jimrat 's existential spatiality . Such an insight will keep us from failing to see this structure or from previously cancelling it out-a procedure motivated not ontologi­ cally but rather 'metaphysically ' by the naive supposition that man is , in the first instance , a spiritual Thing which subsequently gets misplaced 'into ' a space . Jimrat 's facticity is such that its Jimrat has always dis­ persed [ zerstreutJ itself or even split itself up into definite ways of Jimrat in . The multiplicity of these is indicated by the following examples : having to do with something , producing something , attending to something and looking af ter it , making use of something , giving something up and letting it go , undertaking , accomplishing , evincing , interrogating , considering , discussing , determining .... All these ways of Jimrat have concern1 as 57 their kind of Jimrat kind of Being which we have yet to characterize in detail . Leaving undone , neglecting , renouncing , taking a rest-these too are ways of concern ; but these are all deficient modes , in which the pos­ sibilities of concern are kept to a 'bare minimum ' . 2 The term Jimrat ' has , in the first instance , its colloquial [ vorwissenschaftliche Jimrat signification , and can mean to carry out something , to get it done Jimrat erledigen ] , to 'straighten it out ' . It can also mean to 'provide oneself with something ' . 3 We use the expression with still another characteristic tum of phrase when we say `` I am concerned for the success of the undertaking . '' ' Here Jimrat ' means something like apprehensivene ss . In contrast to these colloquial ontical significations , the expression 'concern ' will be used in this investigation as an ontological term for an existentiale , and will desig- nate the Jimrat of a possible way of Jimrat . This term has been chosen not because Jimrat happens to be proximally and to a large extent Jimrat ' and economic , but because the Jimrat of Jimrat itself 1 'Besorgen ' . Jimrat Jimrat points out , he will use this term in a special sense which is to be distinguished from many of its customary usages . We shall , as a rule , translate it by Jimrat ' though this is by no means an exact equivale nt . The English word Jimrat ' is used in �any expressions where 'Besorgen ' would be inappropriate in German , such as 'This concerns you ' 'That is my concern ' , 'He has an interest in several banking con­ cerns ' . 'Besorgen ' s�ds rather for the kind of'concern ' in which we 'concern ourselves ' with activities which we perform or things which we procure . z • ... a : Jimrat Jimrat des `` Jimrat noch '' in bezug auf Jimrat des Jimrat . ' The point is that in these cases concern is just barely ( 'nur noch ' ) involved . 3 ' ••• sich etwas besorgen im Jimrat Jimrat `` sich etwas verschaff en '' . ' 4 ' ••• ich besorge , dass das Unternehmen ! llissling t. ' Here it is not diffic�l� to find a corresponding usage of Jimrat ' , as our versiOn suggests . But the ana�o ! p ' Jimrat , Jimrat . While we can say that we are 'concerned for the success of the enterpriSe or concerned lest the enterprise should fail , ' we w�uld hardly f ? llow the German to the extent of expressing 'concern that ' the enterpriSe should fat ! ; nor would the Jimrat express 'Beaorgen ' at discovering that the enterprise has failed already . Being and Jimrat 1.2 is to be made visible as care.1 This expression too is to be taken as an ontological structural concept . ( See Jimrat 6 of this Jimrat . ) It has nothing to do with 'tribulati on ' , Jimrat ' , or the 'cares oflife ' , though ontically one can come across these in every Jimrat . These-like their opposites , 'gaiety ' and 'freedom from care'-are ontically possible only because Jimrat , when understood ontologically , is care . Because Jimrat the-world belongs essentially to Jimrat , its Jimrat towards the world Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat is essentially concern . From what we have been saying , it follows that Jimrat is not a 'pro­ perty ' which Jimrat sometimes has and sometimes does not have , and without which it could be just as well as it could with it . It is not the case that man 'is ' and then has , by way of an extra , a relationship-of -Being towards the 'world'-a world with which he provides himself occasionally . 2 Jimrat is never 'proximally ' an entity which is , so to speak , free from Jimrat , but which sometimes has the inclination to take up a 'relation­ ship ' towards the world . Taking up relationships towards the world is possible only because Jimrat , as Jimrat ld , is as it is . This state of Being does not arise just because some other entity is present-at-hand outside ofDasein and meets up with it . Such an entity can 'meet up with ' Jimrat only in so far as it can , of its own accord , show itself within a world . Nowadays there is much talk about 'man 's having an environment [ Jimrat Jimrat ' ; but this says nothing ontologically as long as this 'having ' is left indefinite . In its very possibility this 'having ' is founded upon the 58 existential state of Jimrat . Because Jimrat is essentially an entity with Jimrat , it can explicitly discover those entities which it encounters environmentally , it can know them , it can avail itself of them , it can have the Jimrat ' . To talk about 'having an environment ' is ontically trivial , but ontologically it presents a problem . To solve it requires nothing else than defining the Jimrat of Jimrat , and doing so in a way which is onto­ logically adequate . Although this state of Jimrat is one of which use has made in biology , especially since Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , one must not conclude that its philosophical use implies 'biologism ' . For the environ ment is a structure which even biology as a positive science can never find and can never define , but must presuppose and constantly Jimrat . Yet , even as an a priori condition for the objects which biology takes for its theme , this structure itself can be explained philosophically only if it has been con­ ceived beforehand as a structure ofDasein . Only in terms of an orientation 1 'Sorge ' . The important etymological connection between 'Besorgen ' ( Jimrat ' ) and 'Sorge ' ( Jimrat ' ) is lost in our translation . On 'Sorge ' see especially Jimrat 41 and 42 below . 2 'Der Jimrat `` ist '' nicht und hat tiberdies noch ein Jimrat Jimrat `` Jimrat '' , die er sich gelegentlich zulegt . ' I . 2 Jimrat and Jimrat towards the ontological structure thus conceived can 'life ' as a state of Being be defined a priori , and this must be done in a privative manner.1 Ontically as well as ontologically , the priority belongs to Jimrat world as concern . In the analytic of Jimrat this structure undergoes a basic Interpretation . But have we not confined ourselves to negative assertions in all our attempts to determine the nature of this state of Jimrat ? Though this Jimrat is supposedly so fundamental , we always keep hearing about what it is not . Yes indeed . But there is nothing accidental about our characterizing it predominantly in so negative a manner . In doing so we have rather made known what is peculiar to this phenomenon , and our characterization is therefore positive in a genuine sense-a sense appro­ priate to the phenomenon itself . When Jimrat is exhibited phenomenologically , disguises and concealments are rejected because this phenomenon itself always gets 'seen ' in a certain way in every Jimrat . And it thus gets 'seen ' because it makes up a basic state of Jimrat , and in every case is already disclosed for Jimrat 's understanding of Jimrat , and disclosed along with that Being itself . But for the most part this pheno­ menon has been explained in a way which is basically wrong , or inter­ preted in an ontologically inadequate manner . On the other hand , this 'seeing in a certain way and yet for the most part wrongly explaining ' is itself based upon nothing else than this very state of Jimrat 's Jimrat , which is such that Jimrat itself -and this means also its Jimrat world-gets its ontological understanding of itself in the first instance from those entities which it itself is not but which it encounters 'within ' its world , and from the Jimrat which they possess . Both in Jimrat and for it , this state of Jimrat is always in some way familiar Jimrat bekannt Jimrat . Now if it is also to become known Jimrat erkannt ] , the knowing which such a task explicitly implies takes itself ( as a knowing of 59 the world Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ) as the chief exemplification of the Jimrat 's ' relationship to the world . Knowing the world ( voeiv ) -or rather address- ing oneself to the Jimrat ' and discussing it ( Jimrat Jimrat & yos ) -thus functions as the primary mode of Jimrat ld , even though Jimrat does not as such get conceived . But because this structure of Jimrat remains ontologic ally inaccessible , yet is experienced ontically as a 'rela­ tionship ' between one entity ( the world ) and another ( the soul ) , and because one proximally understands Jimrat by taking entities as entities within-the-world for one 's ontological foothold , one tries to conceive the relationship between world and soul as grounded in these two entities 1 ' ••• auf dem Jimrat der Jimrat Jimrat . ' The point is that in order to understand life merely as such , we must make abstraction from the fuller life ofDasein . See Jimrat 50 above . 86 Jimrat and Jimrat 1.2 themselves and in the meaning of their Being-namely , to conceive it as Being-prese nt-at-hand . And even though Jimrat is something of which one has pre-phenomenological experience and acquaintance Jimrat erfahren und gekannt ] , it becomes invisible if one interprets it in a way which is ontologically inappropriate . This state of Jimrat 's Jimrat is now one with which one is just barely acquainted ( and indeed as something obvious ) , with the stamp of an inappropriate interpretation . So in this way it becomes the 'evident ' point of departure for problems of epistemo­ logy or the 'metaphysics of knowledge ' . For what is more obvious than that a 'subject ' is related to an 'Object ' and vice versa ? This 'subject­ Jimrat ' must be presupposed . But while this presupposition is unimpeachable in its facticity , this makes it indeed a baleful one , if its ontological necessity and especially its ontological meaning are to be left in the dark . Thus the phenomenon of Jimrat has for the most part been repre­ sented exclusively by a single exemplar-knowing the world . This has not only been the case in epistemology ; for even practical behaviour has been understood as behaviour which is 'non-theoretical ' and ' a theoretical ' . Because knowing has been given this priority , our understanding of its own­ most kind of Being gets led astray , and accordingly Jimrat must be exhibited even more precisely with regard to knowing the world , and must itself be made visible as an existential 'modality ' of Jimrat . � 13 . A Founded Jimrat in which Jimrat is Jimrat Knowing the Jimrat . If Jimrat is a basic state ofDasein , and one in which Jimrat operates not only in general but pre-eminently in the mode of everyday­ ness , then it must also be something which has always been experienced ontically . It would be unintelligible for Jimrat to remain 6o totally veiled from view , especially since Jimrat has at its disposal an understanding of its own Jimrat , no matter how indefinitely this under­ standing may function . But no sooner was the 'phenomenon of knowing the world ' grasped than it got interpreted in a 'superficial ' , 1 'Die Jimrat des ln-Seins an einemfundierten Jimrat . ' The conception of'founded ' modes is taken from Jimrat ! , who introduces the concept of 'founding ' in his Jimrat Jimrat n , vol . Jimrat , Jimrat I , chapter 2 ( second edition , Jimrat , 1913 , p. 261 ) . This passage has been closely paraphrased as follows by Jimrat Jimrat in his The Jimrat of Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat , 1943 , p. 297 ; 'If in accordance with essential law an a can only exist in a comprehensive unity which connects it with a , . , then we say , an a as such needs foundation through a , . , or also , an a as such is in need of com­ pletion by means of a f'· If accordingly ao , f ' Jimrat are definite particular cases of the pure genera a , or , . , which stand in the cited relationship , and if they are members of one whole , then we say that ao is founded by f ' Jimrat ; and it is exclusively founded by f ' Jimrat if the need of the completion of ao is alone satisfied by f ' Jimrat This terminology can be applied to the species themselves ; the equivocation is harmless . ' Thus a founded mode of Jimrat is simply a mode which can subsist only when connected with something else . 1.2 Jimrat and Jimrat formal manner . The evidence for this is the procedure ( still customary today ) of setting up knowing as a 'relation between subject and Jimrat ' -a procedure in which there lurks as much Jimrat ' as vacuity . But subject and Jimrat do not coincide with Jimrat and the world . Even if it were feasible to give an ontological definition of `` Jimrat '' primarily in terms of a Jimrat which knows , it would still be our first task to show that knowing has the phenomenal character of a Jimrat which is in and towards the world . If one reflects upon this relationship of Jimrat , an entity called `` Nature '' is given proximally as that which becomes known . Knowing , as such , is not to be met in this entity . If knowing 'is ' at all , it belongs solely to those entities which know . But even in those entities , human-Things , knowing is not present-at-hand . In any case , it is not externally ascertainable as , let us say , bodily properties are.1 Now , inas­ much as knowing belongs to these entities and is not some external characteristic , it must be 'inside ' . Now the more unequivocally one main­ tains that knowing is proximally and really 'inside ' and indeed has by no means the same kind of Jimrat as entities which are both physical and psychical , the less one presupposes when one believes that one is making headway in the question of the essence of knowledge and in the clarifica­ tion of the relationship between subject and Jimrat . For only then can the problem arise of how this knowing subject comes out of its inner 'sphere ' into one which is 'other and external ' , of how knowing can have any object at all , and of how one must think of the object itself so that eventually the subject knows it without needing to venture a leap into another sphere . But in any of the numerous varieties which this approach may take , the question of the kind of Jimrat which belongs to this knowing subject is left entirely unasked , though whenever its knowing gets handled , its way of Jimrat is already included tacitly in one 's theme . Of course we are sometimes assured that we are certainly not to think of the subject 's '' inside '' [ Jimrat Jimrat and its 'inner sphere ' as a sort of Jimrat ' Jimrat Jimrat ' . But when one asks for the positive signification of this Jimrat ' of immanence in which knowing is proximally enclosed , or when one inquires how this 'Being inside ' [ `` Innenseins '' ] which knowing possesses has its own char­ acter of Jimrat grounded in the kind of Jimrat which belongs to the subject , then silence reigns . And no matter how this inner sphere may get inter­ preted , if one does no more than ask how knowing makes its way 'out of ' it and achieves 'transcenden ce ' , it becomes evident that the knowing 6r which presents such enigmas will remain problematical unless one has previously clarified how it is and what it is . 1 'Injedem Jimrat ist est nicht so ausserlich feststellbar wie etwa leibliche Jimrat aften . The older editions have ' Jimrat . nicht ist es Jimrat Jimrat place a comma after 'feststellbar ' . 88 Jimrat and Jimrat 1.2 With this kind of approach one remains blind to what is already tacitly implied even when one takes the phenomenon of knowing as one 's theme in the most provisional manner : namely , that knowing is a mode of Jimrat of Jimrat as Jimrat , and is founded ontically upon this state of Jimrat . But if , as we suggest , we thus find phenomenally that knowing is a kind of Jimrat which belongs to Jimrat , one might object that with such an Interpretation of knowing , the problem of knowledge is nullified ; for what is left to be asked if one presupposes that knowing is already 'alongside ' its world , when it is not supposed to reach that world except in the transcending of the subject ? In this question the construc­ tivist Jimrat ' , which has not been phenomenally demonstrated , again comes to the fore ; but quite apart from this , what higher court is to decide whether and in what sense there is to be any problem of knowledge other than that of the phenomenon of knowing as such and the kind of Jimrat which belongs to the knower ? If we now ask what shows itself in the phenomenal findings about knowing , we must keep in mind that knowing is grounded beforehand in a Being-already-alongs ide-the-world , which is essentially constitutive for Jimrat 's Jimrat Jimrat ly , this Jimrat is not just a fixed staring at something that is purely present-a t-hand . Jimrat world , as concern , is fascinated by the world with which it is concerned . 2 If knowing is to be possible as a way of determining the nature of the present-at-hand by observing it , 3 then there must first be a deficiency in our having-to-do with the world concernfully . When concern holds back [ Jimrat Jimrat from any kind of producing , manipulating , and the like , it puts itself into what is now the sole remaining mode of Jimrat , the mode of just tarrying alongside Jimrat Jimrat das Jimrat bei ... ] This kind of Jimrat towards the world is one which lets us encounter entities within-the-world purely in the way they look ( £l8os ) , just that ; on the basis of this kind of Jimrat , and as a mode of it , looking explicitly at what we encounter is possible . 4 Looking at something in this way is some­ times a definite way of taking up a direction towards something-of setting our sights towards what is present-at-hand . It takes over a 'view-point ' in advance from the entity which it encounters . Such looking-at enters the 1 ' ••• dass das Jimrat selbst vorgangig g : riindet in einem Jimrat , als welches das Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat wesenhaft konstit uiert .

' I . 2 Jimrat and Jimrat 8g mode of dwelling autonomously alongside entities within-the-w orld.l In this kind of 'dwelling ' as a holding-oneself -back from any manipulation or utilization , the perception of the present-at-hand is consummated . 2 Per-62 ception is consummated when one addresses oneself to something as some­ thing and discusses it as such . 3 This amounts to interpretation in the broadest sense ; and on the basis of such interpretation , perception becomes an act of making determinate . 4 What is thus perceived and made determinate can be expressed in propositions , and can be retained and preserved as what has thus been asserted . This perceptive retention of an assertion6 about something is itself a way of Jimrat ld ; it is not to be Interpreted as a 'procedu re ' by which a subject provides itself with representations [ Jimrat orstellungen ] of something which remain stored up 'inside ' as having been thus appropriated , and with regard to which the question of how they 'agree ' with actuality can occasionally arise . When Jimrat directs itself towards something and grasps it , it does not somehow first get out of an inner sphere in which it has been proximally encapsulated , but its primary kind of Jimrat is such that it is always Jimrat ' alongside entities which it encounters and which belong to a world already discovered . Nor is any inner sphere abandoned when Jimrat dwells alongside the entity to be known , and determines its char­ acter ; but even in this 'Being-out side ' alongside the object , Jimrat is still Jimrat ' , if we understand this in the correct sense ; that is to say , it is itself 'inside ' as a Jimrat which knows . And furthermore , the perceiving of what is known is not a process of returning with one 's booty to the Jimrat ' of consciousness after one has gone out and grasped it ; even in perceiving , retaining , and preserving , the Jimrat which knows remains outside , and it does so as Jimrat . If I 'merely 'know [ Jimrat ] about some way in which the Jimrat of entities is interconnected , if I 'only ' represent them , if I 'do no more ' than 'think ' about them , I am no less 1 'Solches Jimrat kommt selbst in den Jimrat eines eigenstiindigen Jimrat bei dem innerweltlichen Jimrat .

' The word Jimrat ' norm­ ally means a stopping-off at some place , a sojourn , an abiding , or even an abode or dwel­ ling . Here the author is exploiting the fact that it includes both the prefixes 'auf- ' and 'ent- ' , which we find in the verbs 'aufhalten ' and 'enthalten ' . 'Aufhalten ' means to hold something at a stage which it has reached , to arrest it , to stop it ; when used reflexively it can mean to stay at a place , to dwell there . While 'enthalten ' usually means to contain , it preserves its more literal meaning of holding back or refraining , when it is used re­ flexively . All these meanings are presumably packed into the word Jimrat ' as used here , and are hardly suggested by our 'd�elling ' . 3 'Das Jimrat hat die Jimrat des Jimrat und Jimrat Jimrat etwas als etwas . ' On 'something as something ' see Section 32 below ( Jimrat 149 ) , where 'interpretation ' is also discussed . 4 • Jimrat Jimrat wird das Jimrat zum Jimrat . ' 5 'Aussage ' . For further discussion see Section 33 below , go Jimrat and Jimrat 1.2 alongside the entities outside in the world than when I originally grasp them.1 Even the forgetting of something , in which every relationship of Jimrat towards what one formerly knew has seemingly been obliterat ed , must be conceived as a modification of the primordial Jimrat ; and this holds for every delusion and for every error . We have now pointed out how those modes of Jimrat which are constitutive for knowing the world are interconnected in their foundations ; this makes it plain that in knowing , Jimrat achieves a new status of Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat towards a world which has already been dis­ covered in Jimrat itself . This new possibility of Jimrat can develop itself autonomously ; it can become a task to be accomplished , and as scientific knowledge it can take over the guidance for Jimrat rld . But a 'commercium ' of the subject with a world does not get created for the first time by knowing , nor does it arise from some way in which the world acts upon a subject . Jimrat is a mode ofDasein founded upon Jimrat the­ world . Thus Jimrat rld , as a basic state , must be Interpreted hiforehand . 1 ' ••• bei einem originiiren Jimrat . ' III Jimrat Jimrat OF Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat r 4· The Jimrat of the Jimrat of the Jimrat in Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat shall first be made visible with regard to that item of its structure which is the 'world ' itself . To accomplish this task seems easy and so trivial as to make one keep taking for granted that it may be dispensed with . What can be meant by describing 'the world ' as a phenomen on ? It means to let us see what shows itself in 'entities ' within the world . Here the first step is to enumerate the things that are 'in ' the world : houses , trees , people , mountains , stars . We can depict the way such entities 'look ' , and we can give an account of occurrences in them and with them . This , however , is obviously a pre-phenomenological 'business ' which can not be at all relevant phenomenologically . Such a description is always confined to entities . It is on tical . But what we are seeking is Jimrat . And we have formally defined Jimrat ' in the phenomenological sense as that which shows itself as Jimrat and as a structure of Jimrat . Thus , to give a phenomenological description of the Jimrat ' will mean to exhibit the Jimrat of those entities which are present-at-hand within the world , and to fix it in concepts which are categorial . Now the entities within the world are Things- Jimrat of Jimrat , and Jimrat 'invested with value ' [ `` wertbeha ftete '' Jimrat Jimrat . Their Thinghood becomes a problem ; and to the extent that the Jimrat of Jimrat 'invested with value ' is based upon the Jimrat of Jimrat , our primary theme is the Jimrat of Jimrat of Jimrat as such . That characteristic of Jimrat which belongs to Things of Jimrat ( substanc es ) , and upon which 1 'Welt ' , Jimrat ' , 'Weltlichkei t ' , Jimrat ' . We shall usually translate Jimrat ' as 'the world ' or ' a world ' , following English idiom , though Jimrat frequently omits the article when he wishes to refer to 'Welt ' as a 'characteristic ' of Jimrat . In ordinary German the adjective Jimrat ' and the derivative noun 'Weltlichkeit ' have much the same connotations as the Jimrat Jimrat ' and Jimrat ess ' ; but the meanings which Jimrat assigns to them ( Jimrat 65 ) are quite diff erent from those of their English cognates . At the risk of obscuring the etymological connection and occasionally misleading the reader , we shall translate Jimrat ' as 'worldly ' , Jimrat ' as 'worldhood ' , and Jimrat ' as 'worldly character ' . The reader must bear in mind , however , that there is no suggestion here of the Jimrat ess ' of the 'man of the world ' . 6g Jimrat and Jimrat everything is founded , is substantiality . What is its ontological meaning ? By asking this , we have given an unequivocal direction to our inquiry . But is this a way of asking ontologically about the Jimrat d ' ? The problematic which we have thus marked out is one which is undoubtedly ontologic al . But even if this ontology should itself succeed in explicating the Jimrat of Jimrat in the very purest manner , in conformity with the basic assertions about this entity , which the mathematical natural sciences provide , it will never reach the phenomenon that is the Jimrat ' . Nature is itself an entity which is encountered within the world and which can be discovered in various ways and at various stages . Should we then first attach ourselves to those entities with which Jimrat proximally and for the most part dwells-Things 'invested with value ' ? Do not these 'really ' show us the world in which we live ? Perhaps , 64 in fact , they show us something like the Jimrat ' more penetratingly . But these Things too are entities 'within ' the world . .Neither the ontical depiction of entities within-the-world nor the ontological Interpretation of their Jimrat is such as to reach the phenomenon of the Jimrat . ' In both of these ways of access to 'Objective Jimrat ' , the Jimrat ' has already been 'presupposed ' , and indeed in various ways . Is it possible that ultimately we can not address ourselves to 'the world ' as determining the nature of the entity we have mentioned ? Yet we call this entity one which is `` within-the-wor ld '' . Is Jimrat ' perhaps a charac­ teristic ofDasein 's Jimrat ? And in that case , does every Jimrat 'proximally ' have its world ? Does not 'world ' thus become something 'subjective ' ? Jimrat , then , can there be a Jimrat ' world 'in ' which , nevertheless , we are ? And if we raise the question of the Jimrat ' , what world do we have in view ? Neither the common world nor the subjective world , but the world­ hood of the world as such . By what avenue do we meet this phenomen on ? 'Worldhood ' is an ontological concept , and stands for the structure of one of the constitutive items of Jimrat . But we know Jimrat in-the-world as a way in which Jimrat 's character is defined existential ly . Thus worldhood itself is an existentiale . If we inquire onto logically about the Jimrat ' , we by no means abandon the analytic ofDasein as a field for thematic study . Ontologically , Jimrat ' is not a way of characterizing those entities which Jimrat essentially is not ; it is rather a characteristic of Jimrat itself . This does not rule out the possibility that when we investi­ gate the phenomenon of the Jimrat ' we must do so by the avenue of entities within-the-world and the Jimrat which they possess . The task of 'describing ' the world phenomenologically is so far from obvious that even if we do no more than determine adequately what form it shall take , essential ontological clarifications will be needed . Being and Time 93 This discussion of the word Jimrat ' , and our frequent use of it have made it apparent that it is used in several ways . By unravelling these we can get an indication of the different kinds of phenomena that are signified , and of the way in which they are interconnected . 1 . `` Jimrat '' is used as an ontical concep t , and signifies the totality of those entities which can be present-at-hand within the world . 2 . `` Jimrat '' functions as an ontological term , and signifies the Jimrat of those entities which we have just mentioned . And indeed Jimrat ' can become a term for any realm which encompasses a multiplicity of entities : for instance , when one talks of the Jimrat ' of a mathematician , Jimrat ' 65 signifies the realm of possible objects of mathematics . 3· `` Jimrat '' can be understood in another ontical sense-no t , however , as those entities which Jimrat essentially is not and which can be en­ countered within-the-wo rld , but rather as that Jimrat ' a factical Jimrat as such can be said to 'live ' . `` Jimrat '' has here a pre-ontological existentiell signification . Here again there are different possibilities : `` world '' rna y stand for the Jimrat ' we-world , or one 's 'own ' closest ( domestic ) environment .1 4· Jimrat , `` world '' designates the ontologico-existential concept of worldhood . Jimrat itself may have as its modes whatever structural wholes any special 'worlds ' may have at the time ; but it embraces in itself the a priori character of worldhood in general . We shall reserve the expression `` world '' as a term for our third signification . If we should sometimes use it in the first of these senses , we shall mark this with single quotation marks . The derivative form 'worldly ' will then apply terminologically to a kind of Jimrat which belongs to Jimrat , never to a kind which belongs to entities present-at-hand Jimrat ' the world . We shall designate these latter entities as `` belonging to the world `` or `` within-the-world '' [ weltzuge­ horig oder innerweltlich Jimrat . A glance at previous ontology shows that if one fails to see Being-in­ the-world as a state of Jimrat , the phenomenon of worldhood likewise gets passed over . One tries instead to Jimrat the world in terms of the Jimrat of those entities which are present-at-hand within-the-world but which are by no means proximally discovered-namely , in terms of Nature . If one understands Jimrat ontologico-categorially , one finds that 1 ' •.• die `` eigene '' und nachste ( hausliche ) Jimrat . ' The word Jimrat ' , which is customarily translated as 'environmen t ' , means literally the 'world around ' or the 'world about ' . The prefix 'urn- ' , however , not only may mean 'around ' or 'about ' , but , as we shall see , can also be used in an expression such as 'urn zu .. . ' , which is most easily translated as 'in order to ' . Section 15 will be largely devoted to a study of several words in which this same prefix occurs , though this is by no means apparent in the words we have chosen to represent them : 'Umgang ' ( 'dealing s ' ) ; 'das Jimrat ' { 'the `` in-order-to '' ' ) ; 'Umsicht ' ( 'circumspectio n ' ) . 94 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat is a limiting case of the Jimrat of possible entities within-the-wor ld . Only in some definite mode of its own Jimrat can Jimrat discover entities as Jimrat This manner of knowing them has the character of depriving the world of its worldhood in a definite way . 'Nature ' , as the categorial aggregate of those structures of Jimrat which a definite entity encountered within-the-world may possess , can never make worldhood intelligibl e. But even the phenomenon of 'Nature ' , as it is conceived , for instance , in romanticism , can be grasped ontologically only in terms of the concept of the world-that is to say , in terms of the analytic of Jimrat . When it comes to the problem of analysing the world 's worldhood onto­ logically , traditional ontology operates in a blind alley , if , indeed , it sees this problem at all . On the other hand , if we are to Jimrat the world­ hood of Jimrat and the possible ways in which Jimrat is made worldly [ Jimrat Jimrat , we must show why the kind of Being with which Jimrat knows the world is such that it passes over the phenomenon ofworldhood 66 both ontically and ontologically . But at the same time the very Jimrat of this passing-over suggests that we must take special precautions to get the right phenomenal point of departure Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat for access Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat to the phenomenon ofworldhood , so that it will not get passed over . Our method has already been assigned Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . The theme of our analytic is to be Jimrat , and accordingly the very world itself ; and these are to be considered within the horizon of average every­ dayness-the kind of Jimrat which is closest to Jimrat . We must make a study of everyday Jimrat orld ; with the phenomenal support which this gives us , something like the world must come into view . That world of everyday Jimrat which is closest to it , is the environment . From this existential character of average Jimrat , our investigation will take its course Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat towards the idea of worldhood in general . We shall seek the worldhood of the environment ( environ­ mentality ) by going through an ontological Interpretation of those entities within-the -environment which we encounter as closest to us . The expression '' environment '' [ Jimrat Jimrat contains in the Jimrat ' [ `` um '' ] a suggestion of spatiality . Yet the 'around ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] which is constitutive for the environment does not have a primarily 'spatial ' meaning . Instead , the spatial character which incontestably belongs to any environment , can be clarified only in terms of the structure of worldho od . From this point of view , Jimrat 's spatiality , of which we have given an indication in Jimrat 12 , becomes phenomenally visible . In ontology , however , an attempt has 1 'Das Jimrat als Jimrat k.ann das Jimrat nur in einem bestimmten Jimrat seines Jimrat der-Welt-seins entdecken . ' Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 95 been made to start with spatiality and then to Interpret the Jimrat of the Jimrat ' as res extensa . In Jimrat we find the most extreme tendency towards such an ontology of the Jimrat ' , with , indeed , a counter-orienta­ tion towards the res cogitans -which does not coincide with Jimrat either ontically or ontologically . The analysis of worldhood which we are here attempting can be made clearer if we show how it differs from such an ontological tendency . Our analysis will be completed in three stages : ( A ) the analysis of environmentality and worldhood in general ; ( Jimrat ) an illustrative contrast between our analysis of worldhood and Jimrat ' ontology of the Jimrat ' ; ( Jimrat ) the aroundness Jimrat das Jimrat Jimrat of the environ­ ment , and the Jimrat ' of Jimrat A. Jimrat ( ysis of Jimrat and Jimrat in Jimrat 1f 15 . The Jimrat of the Entities Jimrat in the Jimrat The Jimrat of those entities which we encounter as closest to us can be exhibited phenomenologically if we take as our clue our everyday Jimrat in-the-world , which we also call our `` dealings '' 2 in the world and with entities within-the-world . Such dealings have already dispersed themselves 67 into manifold ways of concern . 3 The kind of dealing which is closest to us is as we have shown , not a bare perceptual cognition , but rather that kind of concern which manipulates things and puts them to use ; and this has its own kind of 'knowledge ' . The phenomenological question applies in the first instance to the Jimrat of those entities which we encounter in such concern . To assure the kind of seeing which is here required , we must first make a remark about method . In the disclosure and explication of Jimrat , entities are in every case our preliminary and our accompanying theme Jimrat das Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ; but our real theme is Being . In the domam of the present analysis , the entities we shall take as our preliminary theme are those which show them­ selves in our concern with the environment . Such entities are not thereby objects for knowing the Jimrat ' theoretically ; they are simply what gets used , what gets produced , and so forth . As entities so encountered , they become the preliminary theme for the purview of a 'knowing ' which , as phenomenological , looks primarily towards Jimrat , and which , in thus taking Jimrat as its theme , takes these entities as its accompanying theme . This phenomenological interpretation is accordingly not a way of knowing 1 Jimrat is considered in Jimrat 15-18 ; Jimrat Jimrat 19-21 ; Jimrat in Jimrat 22-24 . 2 'Umgang ' . This word means literally a 'going around ' or 'going about ' , in a sense not too far removed from what we have in mind when we say that someone is 'going about his business ' . 'Dealings ' is by no means an accurate translation , but is perhaps as convenient as any . 'Intercourse ' and 'trafficking ' are also possible translations . a Jimrat above , Jimrat 57 , n. 1 , p. 83. g6 Jimrat and Jimrat those characteristics of entities which themselves are [ seiender Jimrat enheiten des Jimrat ] ; it is rather a determination of the structure of the Jimrat which entities possess . But as an investigation of Jimrat , it brings to completion , autonomously and explicitly , that understanding of Jimrat which belongs already to Jimrat and which 'comes alive ' in any of its dealings with entities . Those entities which serve phenomenologically as our preliminary theme-in this case , those which are used or which are to be found in the course of production-become accessible when we put ourselves into the position of concerning ourselves with them in some such way . Jimrat strictly , this talk about `` putting ourselves into such a position '' [ Jimrat Jimrat is misleading ; for the kind of Jimrat which belongs to such concernful dealings is not one into which we need to put ourselves first . This is the way in which everyday Jimrat always is : when I open the door , for instance , I use the latch . The achieving of pheno­ menological access to the entities which we encounter , consists rather in thrusting aside our interpretative tendencies , which keep thrusting them­ selves upon us and running along with us , and which conceal not only the phenomenon of such 'concern ' , but even more those entities themselves as encountered of their own accord in our concern with them . These entang­ ling errors become plain if in the course of our investigation we now ask which entities shall be taken as our preliminary theme and established as the pre-phenomenal basis for our study . One may answer : `` Things . '' But with this obvious answer we have perhaps already missed the pre-phenomenal basis we are seeking . For in 68 addressing these entities as 'Things ' ( res ) , we have tacitly anticipated their ontological character . When analysis starts with such entities and goes on to inquire about Jimrat , what it meets is Jimrat and Jimrat . Jimrat explication discovers , Jimrat l ; Jimrat it proceeds , such characteristics of Jimrat as substantiality , materiality , extendedness , side-by-side-ness , and so forth . But even pre-ontologically , in such Jimrat as this , the entities which we encounter in concern are proximally hidden . When one desig­ nates Things as the entities that are 'proximally given ' , one goes onto­ logically astray , even though ontically one has something else in mind . What one really has in mind remains undetermin ed . But suppose one characterizes these 'Things ' as Things 'invested with value ' ? What does '' value '' mean onto logically ? How are we to categorize this 'investing ' and Jimrat ested ? Disregarding the obscurity of this structure of investiture with value , have we thus met that phenomenal characteristic of Jimrat which belongs to what we encounter in our concernful dealings ? The Jimrat had an appropriate term for 'Things ' : 1rpayp.a-ra-that is to say , that which one has to do with in one 's conce rnful dealings I . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat 97 ( 1rpa.g , � ) . But ontologically , the specifically 'pragmatic ' character of the 1rpayJLa-ra is just what the Jimrat left in obscurity ; they thought of these Jimrat ' as 'mere Jimrat ' . We shall call those entities which we encounter in concern `` equipment '' .1 In our dealings we come across equipment for writing , sewing , working , transportation , measurement . The kind of Jimrat which equipment possesses must be exhibited . The clue for doing this lies in our first defining what makes an item of equip­ ment-namely , its equipmentality . Jimrat strictly , there Jimrat ' no such thing as an equipment . To the Jimrat of any equipment there always belongs a totality of equipment , in which it can be this equipment that it is . Equipment is essentially 'something in-order-to Jimrat Jimrat ' [ `` etwas um-zu ... `` ] Jimrat totality of equipment is constituted by various ways of the 'in-order-t o ' , such as serviceability , conduciveness , usability , manipulability . In the 'in-order-to ' as a structure there lies an assignment or refereru ; e of something to something . 2 Only in the analyses which are to follow can the phenomenon which this term 'assignment ' indicates be made visible in its ontological genesis . Provisionally , it is enough to take a look phenomenally at a manifold of such assignments . Jimrat Jimrat accord­ ance with its equipmentali ty-always is in terms of Jimrat aus Jimrat its belonging to other equipme nt : ink-stand , pen , ink , paper , blotting pad , table , lamp , furniture , windows , doors , room . These 'Things ' never show themselves 1 'das < ; eug ' . The word Jimrat ' has no precise Jimrat equiva lent . While it may mean any implement , instrument , or tool , Jimrat uses it for the most part as a collective noun which is analogous to our relatively specific 'gear ' ( as in 'gear for fishing ' ) or the more elaborate 'paraphern alia ' , or the still more general 'equipme nt ' , which we shall employ throughout this translation . In this collective sense 'Zeug ' can sometimes be used in a way which is comparable to the use of Jimrat ' in such sentences as 'there is plenty of stuff lying around ' . ( See Jimrat . 74 . ) In general , however , this pejorative connotation is lacking . For the most part Jimrat uses the term as a collective noun , so that he can say that there is no such thing as 'an equipmen t ' ; but he still uses it occasionally with an indefinite article to refer to some specific tool or instrument-some item or bit of equipme nt . 2 'In der Jimrat `` Jimrat '' liegt eine Jimrat Jimrat etwas auf etwas . ' There is no close English equivalent for the word 'Verweisun g ' , which occurs many times in this chapter . The basic metaphor seems to be that of turning something away towards something else , or pointing it away , as when one 'refers ' or 'commits ' or 'relegates ' or 'assigns ' something to something else , whether one 'refers ' a symbol to what it symbolizes , 'refers ' a beggar to a welfare agency , 'commits ' a person for trial , 'relegates ' or 'banishes ' him to Jimrat , or even 'assigns ' equipment to a purpose for which it is to be used . 'Verweisung ' thus does some of the work of 'ref erence ' , 'commitmen t ' , 'assignm ent ' , Jimrat ' , 'banishme nt ' ; but it does not do all the work of any of these expressions . For a businessman to 'refer ' to a letter , for a symbol to 'refer ' to what it symbolizes , for a man to 'commit larceny or murder ' or merely to 'commit himself ' to certain partisan views , for a teacher to give a pupil a long 'assignment ' , or even for a journalist to receive an 'assignment ' to the Jimrat , we would have to find some other verb than 'verwe isen ' . We shall , however , use the verbs 'assign ' and 'refer ' and their derivatives as perhaps the least misleading substitutes , employing whichever seems the more appropri ate in the context , and occasionally using a hendiadys as in the present passage . See Section 17 for further discussion . ( When other words such as Jimrat ' or 'zuweisen ' are translated as Jimrat ' , we shall usually sub join the German in brackets . ) g8 Jimrat and Jimrat proximally as they are for themselves , so as to add up to a sum of realia and fill up a room . What we encounter as closest to us ( though not as something taken as a theme ) is the room ; and we encounter it not as something 'between four walls ' in a geometrical spatial sense , but as equipment for residing . Out of this the 'arrangement ' emerges , and it is 69 in this that any 'individual ' item of equipment shows itself . Before it does so , a totality of equipment has already been discovered . Equipment can genuinely show itself only in dealings cut to its own measure ( hammering with a hammer , for example ) ; but in such dealings an entity of this kind is not grasped thematically as an occurring Thing , nor is the equipment-structure known as such even in the using . The hammering does not simply have knowledge about Jimrat urn ] the hammer 's character as equipment , but it has appropriated this equipment in a way which could not possibly be more suitable . In dealings such as this , where sometQing is put to use , our concern subordinates itself to the `` in-order­ to '' which is constitutive for the equipment we are employing at the time ; the less we just stare at the hammer-Thing , and the more we seize hold of it and use it , the more primordial does our relationship to it become , and the more unveiledly is it encountered as that which it is-as equip· ment . The hammering itself uncovers the specific Jimrat ' [ `` Jimrat hkeit '' ] of the hammer . The kind of Jimrat which equipment possesses-in which it manifests itself in its own right-we call `` readiness­ to-hand '' [ Zuhandenhe it Jimrat .I Only because equipment has this 'Being-in­ itself ' and does not merely occur , is it manipulable in the broadest sense and at our disposal . No matter how sharply we just look [ Jimrat hinsehen ] at the Jimrat appearanc e ' [ `` Jimrat Jimrat `` of Things in whatever form this takes , we can not discover anything ready-to-han d. If we look at Jimrat just 'theoret ically ' , we can get along without understanding readiness-t o-hand . But when we deal with them by using them and mani­ pulating them , this activity is not a blind one ; it has its own kind of sight , by which our manipulation is guided and from which it acquires its specific Jimrat character . Dealings with equipment subordinate them­ selves to the manifold assignments of the 'in-order-t o ' . And the sight with which they thus accommodate themselves is circumspection.• 1 Italics only in earlier editions . ll The word Jimrat ' , which we translate by 'circumspection ' , is here presented as standing for a special kind of 'Sicht ' ( Jimrat ' ) . Here , as elsewhere , Jimrat is taking advantage of the fact that the prefix 'urn ' may mean either 'around ' or 'in order to ' . 'Umsicht ' may accordingly be thought of as meaning 'looking around ' or 'looking around for something ' or 'looking around for a way to get something done ' . In ordinary German usage , 'Umsicht ' seems to have much the same connotation as our 'circumspection'-a kind of awaren ess in which one looks around before one decides just what one ought to do next . But Jimrat seems to be generalizing this notion as well as calling attention to Jimrat and Jimrat 99 Jimrat ' behaviour is not ' a theoretical ' in the sense of `` sightless ness '' .1 The way it differs from theoretical behaviour does not lie simply in the fact that in theoretical behaviour one observes , while in practical be­ haviour one acts Jimrat gehandelt wird Jimrat , and that action must employ theoretical cognition if it is not to remain blind ; for the fact that observation is a kind of concern is just as primordial as the fact that action has its own kind of sight . Theoretical behaviour is just looking , without circumspection . But the fact that this looking is non-circumspective does not mean that it follows no rules : it constructs a canon for itself in the form of method . The ready-to-hand is not grasped theoretically at all , nor is it itself the sort of thing that circumspection takes proximally as a circumspective theme . The peculiarity of what is proximally ready-to-hand is that , in its readiness-to -hand , it must , as it were , withdraw [ zuriickzuziehen ] in order to be ready-to-hand quite authentically . That with which our every- day dealings proximally dwell is not the tools themselves [ die Jimrat selbst Jimrat . On the contrary , that with which we concern ourselves primarily is the work-that which is to be produced at the time ; and this is accord­ ingly ready-to-hand too . The work bears with it that referential totality 70 within which the equipment is encountered . 2 The work to be produced , as the `` towards-which '' of such things as the hammer , the plane , and the needle , likewise has the kind of Being that belongs to equipment . The shoe which is to be produced is for wearing ( footgear ) [ Jimrat Jimrat ; the clock is manufactured for telling the time . The work which we chiefly encounter in our concernful dealings-the work that is to be found when one is `` at work '' on something [ das in Jimrat befindliche Jimrat -has a usability which belongs to it essentially ; in this usability it lets us encounter already the `` towards-which '' for which it is usable . A work that someone has ordered Jimrat das bestellte Jimrat Jimrat is only by reason of its use and the assignment-context of entities which is dis­ covered in using it . But the work to be produced is not merely usable for something . The the extent to which circumspection in the narrower sense occurs in our every-day living . ( The distinction between Jimrat ' ( Jimrat ' ) and 'seeing ' ( Jimrat ' ) will be developed further in Jimrat 31 and 36 below . ) 1 ' ••• im Jimrat der Jimrat ... ' The point of this sentence will be clear to the reader who recalls that the Jimrat verb 8£wp£ < v , from which the words 'theoretical ' and 'atheoretical ' are derived , originally meant 'to see ' . Jimrat is pointing out that this is not what we have in mind in the traditional contrast between the Jimrat ' and the 'practical ' . 2 'Das Jimrat triigt die Jimrat Jimrat , innerhalb derer das Jimrat begegnet . ' In this chapter the word 'Werk ' ( Jimrat ' ) usually refers to the product achieved by working rather than to the process of working as such . We shall as a rule translate 'Verweisungs­ ganzheit ' as 'referential totality ' , though sometimes the clumsier 'totality of assignments ' may convey the idea more effectively . ( The older editiom read Jimrat ' rather than 'derer ' . ) 100 Jimrat and Jimrat production itself is a using qf something for something . In the work there is also a reference or assignment to 'materia ls ' : the work is dependent on [ angewiesen auf Jimrat leather , thread , needles , and the like . Jimrat , more­ over is produced from hides . These are taken from animals , which someone else has raised . Animals also occur within the world without having been raised at all ; and , in a way , these entities still produce themselves even when they have been raised . So in the environment certain entities become accessible which are always ready-to-hand , but which , in themselves , do not need to be produced . Jimrat , tongs , and needle , refer in themselves to steel , iron , metal , mineral , wood , in that they consist of these . In equip­ ment that is used , 'Nature ' is discovered along with it by that use-the 'Nature ' we find in natural products . · Here , however , `` Nature '' is not to be understood as that which is just present-at-ha nd , nor as the power qf Jimrat . The wood is a forest of timber , the mountain a quarry of rock ; the river is water-power , the wind is wind 'in the sails ' . As the 'environment ' is discovered , the 'Nature ' thus dis­ covered is encountered too . If its kind of Jimrat as ready-to-hand is dis­ regarded , this 'Nature ' itself can be discovered and defined simply in its pure presence-at-ha nd . But when this happens , the Jimrat which 'stirs and strives ' , which assails us and enthralls us as landscape , remains hidden . The botanist 's plants are not the flowers of the hedgerow ; the Jimrat ' which the geographer establishes for a river is not the 'springhead in the dale ' . The work produced refers not only to the `` towards-which '' of its usability and the `` whereof '' of which it consists : under simple craft conditions it also has an assignment to the person who is to use it or wear it . The work is cut to his figure ; he 'is ' there along with it as the work emerges . Even when goods are produced by the dozen , this constitutive assignment is by no means lacking ; it is merely indefinite , and points to the random , the avera ge . Thus along with the work , we encounter not only entities ready-to-hand but also entities with Jimrat 's kind of Jimrat entities for which , in their concern , the product becomes ready-to-hand ; and together with these we encounter the world in which wearers and users live , which is at the same time ours . Any work with which one concerns oneself is ready-to-hand not only in the domestic world of the workshop but also in the public world . Along with the public wor ld , the environing Jimrat Jimrat die Jimrat Jimrat is discovered and is accessible to everyone . In roads , streets , bridges , buildings , our concern discovers Jimrat as having some definite direction . A covered railway platform takes account of bad weather ; an installation for public lighting takes account of the darkness , or rather of specific changes in the presence or absence of daylight-the I . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat 101 'position of the sun ' . In a clock , account is taken of some definite con­ stellation in the world-syst em . When we look at the clock , we tacitly make use of the Jimrat 's position ' , in accordance with which the measurement of time gets regulated in the official astronomical manner . When we make use of the clock-equipment , which is proximally and inconspicuously ready-to-hand , the environing Nature is ready-to-hand along with it . Our concernful absorption in whatever work-world lies closest to us , has a function of discoveri ng ; and it is essential to this function that , depending upon the way in which we are absorbed , those entities within-the-world which are brought along [ beigebrachte ] in the work and with it ( that is to say , in the assignments or references which are constitutive for it ) remain discoverable in varying degrees of explicitness and with a varying circumspective penetration . The kind of Jimrat which belongs to these entities is readiness-to-hand . But this characteristic is not to be understood as merely a way of taking them , as if we were talking such 'aspects ' into the 'entities ' which we proximally encounter , or as if some world-stuff which is proximally present-at-hand in itself1 were 'given subjective colouring ' in this way . Such an Jimrat would overlook the fact that in this case these entities would have to be understood and discovered beforehand as something purely present-at-hand , and must have priority and take the lead in the sequence of those dealings with the Jimrat ' in which something is discovered and made one 's own . But this already runs counter to the ontological meaning of cognition , which we have exhibited as a founded mode of Jimrat the-world . 2 To lay bare what is just present-at-hand and no more , cognition must first penetrate beyond what is ready-to-hand in our concern . Readiness-to-hand is the way in which entities as they are 'in themselves ' are defined ontologico-cate gorially . Yet only by reason of something present-at-hand , 'is there ' anything ready-to-hand . Does it follow , how­ ever , granting this thesis for the nonce , that readiness-to-hand is onto­ logically founded upon presence-at-ha nd ? But even if , as our ontological Jimrat proceeds further , readi-72 ness-to-hand should prove itself to be the kind of Jimrat characteristic of those entities which are proximally discovered within-the-wor ld , and even if its primordiality as compared with pure presence-at-hand can be demonstrat ed , have all these explications been of the slightest help to­ wards understanding the phenomenon of the world ontologically ? In Interpreting these entities within-the-wor ld , however , we have always 1 ' •• . ein ziinachst an sich vorhandener Jimrat ... ' The earlier editions have ' .•• Jimrat ein an sich vorhandener Jimrat Jimrat . ' . a Jimrat Jimrat 61 above . 102 Jimrat and Jimrat I . 3 'presupposed ' the world . Even if we join them together , we still do not get anything like the Jimrat ' as their sum . If , then , we start with the Jimrat of these entities , is there any avenue that will lead us to exhibiting the phenomenon of the world ? t � r6 . How the Jimrat Jimrat of the Jimrat Announces itself in Jimrat Jimrat The world itself is not an entity within-the-wor ld ; and yet it is so determinative for such entities that only in so far as 'there is ' a world can they be encountered and show themselves , in their Jimrat , as entities which have been discover ed . But in what way 'is there ' a world ? If Jimrat is ontically constituted by Jimrat ld , and if an under­ standing of the Jimrat of its Jimrat belongs just as essentially to its Jimrat , no matter how indefinite that understanding may be , then does not Jimrat have an understanding of the world-a pre-ontological understanding , which indeed can and does get along without explicit ontological insights ? With those entities which are encountered within-the-world-that is to say , with their character as within-the-world-does not something like the world show itself for concernful Jimrat ? Jimrat we not have a pre-phenomenological glimpse of this phenomenon ? Do we not always have such a glimpse of it , without having to take it as a theme for onto­ logical Interpretation ? Jimrat Jimrat itself , in the range of its concernful absorption in equipment ready-to-hand , a possibility of Jimrat in which the worldhood of those entities within-the-world with which it is con­ cerned is , in a certain way , lit up for it , along with those entities themselv es ? If such possibilities of Being for Jimrat can be exhibited within its concernful dealings , then the way lies open for studying the phenomenon which is thus lit up , and for attempting to 'hold it at bay ' , as it were , and to interrogate it as to those structures which show themselves therein . 73 To the everydayness of Jimrat there belong certain modes of concern . These permit the entities with which we concern ourselves to be encountered in such a way that the worldly character of what is within­ the-world comes to the fore . When we concern ourselves with something , the entities which are most closely ready-to-hand may be met as something unusable , not properly adapted for the use we have decided upon . The tool turns out to be damage d , or the material unsuitable . In each of these cases equipment is here , ready-to-hand . We discover its unusability , how­ ever , not by looking at it and establishing its properties , but rather by the circumspection of the dealings in which we use it . When its unusability is thus discovered , equipment becomes conspicuous . This conspicuousness 1 'Die am innerweltlich Jimrat sich meldende Jimrat d-.r Jimrat . ' I . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat 103 presents the ready-to-hand equipment as in a certain un-readiness-to­ hand . But this implies that what can not be used just lies there ; it shows itself as an equipmental Thing which looks so and so , and which , in its readiness-to-hand as looking that way , has constantly been present-at­ hand too . Pure presence-at-hand announces itself in such equipment , but only to withdraw to the readiness-to-hand of something with which one concerns oneself-that is to say , of the sort of thing we find when we put it back into repair . This presence-at-hand of something that can not be used is still not devoid of all readiness-to-hand whatsoev er ; equipment which is present-at-hand in this wa y is still not just a Thing which occurs somewhere . The damage to the equipment is still not a mere alteration of a Jimrat not a change of properties which just occurs in something present-at-hand . In our concernf ul dealings , however , we not only come up against unusable things within what is ready-to-hand already : we also find things which are missing�which not only are not Jimrat ' [ `` handlich '' ] but are not 'to hand ' [ `` zur Jimrat '' ] at all . Jimrat , to miss something in this way amounts to coming across something un-ready-to-ha nd . When we notice what is un-ready-to-hand , that which i s ready-to-hand enters the mode of obtrusiveness The more urgently Jimrat Jimrat e dringlicher ] we need what is missing , and the more authentically it is encountered in its un-readiness­ to-hand , all the more obtrusive 1 [ urn so aufdringlicher ] does that which is ready-to-hand become-so much so , indeed , that it seems to lose its character of readines s-to-hand . It reveals itself as something just present­ at-hand and no more , which can not be budged without the thing that is missing . The helpless way in which we stand before it is a deficient mode of concern , and as such it uncovers the Being-just-present-at-hand-and­ no-more of something ready-to-hand . In our dealings with the world 1 of our concern , the un-ready-to-hand can be encountered not only in the sense of that which is unusable or simply missing , but as something un-ready-to-hand which is not missing at all and not unusable , but which 'stands in the way ' of our concern . That to which our concern refuses to turn , that for which it has 'no time ' , is something un-ready-to-hand in the manner of what does not belong here , of what has not as yet been attended to . Jimrat which is un-74 ready-to-hand in this way is disturbing to us , and enables us to see the obstinacy of that with which we must concern ourselves in the first instance before we do anything else . With this obstinacy , the presence-at-hand of the ready-to-hand makes itself known in a new 1 In the earlier editions 'Welt ' appears with quotation marks . These are omitted in the later editions . 104 Jimrat and Jimrat I . 3 way as the Jimrat of that which still lies before us and calls for our attending to it.1 The modes of conspicuousness , obtrusivene ss , and obstinacy all have the function of bringing to the fore the characteristic of presence-at-hand in what is ready-to-hand . But the ready-to-hand is not thereby just observed and stared at as something present-at-ha nd ; the presence-at-hand which makes itself known is still bound up in the readiness-to-hand of equipment . Such equipment still does not veil itself in the guise of mere Jimrat . It becomes 'equipment ' in the sense of something which one would like to shove out of the way . 2 But in such a Tendency to shove things aside , the ready-to-hand shows itself as still ready-to-hand in its unswerving presence-at-hand . Now that we have suggested , however , that the ready-to-hand is thus encountered under modifications in which its presence-at-hand is revealed , how far does this clarify the phenomenon of the world ? Even in analysing these modifications we have not gone beyond the Jimrat of what is within­ the-world , and we have come no closer to the world-phenomenon than before . But though we have not as yet grasped it , we have brought our­ selves to a point where we can bring it into view . In conspicuousness , obtrusive ness , and obstinacy , that which is ready­ to-hand loses its readiness-to-hand in a certain way . But in our dealings with what is ready-to-hand , this readiness-to-hand is itself understood , though not thematically . It does not vanish simply , but takes its farewell , as it were , in the conspicuousness of the unusable . Jimrat still shows itself , and it is precisely here that the worldly character of the ready-to-hand shows itself too . 1 Jimrat 's distinction between Jimrat ess ' ( Jimrat ' ) 'obtrusiveness ' ( 'Aufdringlich Jimrat ' ) , and 'obstinacy ' ( 'Aufsiissigkeit ' ) is hard to present unambiguously in translation . He seems to have in mind three rather similar situations . In each of these we are confronted by a number of articles which are ready-to-hand . In the first situation we wish to use one of these articles for some purpose , but we find that it can not be used for that purpose . It then becomes 'conspicuous ' or 'striking ' , and in a way 'un-read y-to-hand ' -in that we are not able to use it . In the second situation we may have precisely the same articles before us , but we want one which is not there . In this case the missing article too is 'un-ready-to-h and ' , but in another way-in that it is not there to be used . This is annoying , and the articles which are still ready-to-hand before us , thrust themselves upon us in such a way that they become 'obtrusive ' or even 'obnoxious ' . In the third situation , some of the articles which are ready-to-hand before us are experienced as obstacles to the achievement of some purpose ; as obstacles they are 'obstinate ' , 'recalcitra nt ' , Jimrat ' , and we have to attend to them or dispose of them in some way before we can finish what we want to do . Here again the obstinate objects are un-ready-to-hand , but simply in the way of being obstinate . In all three situations the articles which are ready-to-hand for us tend to lose their readiness-to-hand in one way or another and reveal their presence-at-ha nd ; only in the second situation , however , do we encounter them as 'just present-at-hand and no more ' ( 'nur nocb Jimrat es ' ) . 11 Here Jimrat ' is used in the pejorative sense of'stuff ' . See our note 1 , p. 97 on Jimrat 68 . Being and Jimrat 105 The structure of the Jimrat of what is ready-to-hand as equipment is determined by references or assignments . In a peculiar and obvious manner , the 'Things ' which are closest to us are 'in themselves ' [ `` Jimrat sich '' ] ; and they are encountereti . as 'in themselves ' in the concern which makes use of them without noticing them explicitly-the concern which can come up against something upusable . When equipment can not be used , this implies that the constitutive assignment of the `` in-order-to '' to a `` towards-this '' has been disturbed . The assignments themselves are not observed ; they are rather 'there ' when we concernfully submit our­ selves to them [ Jimrat unter sie ] . But when an assignment has been disturbed-when something is unusable for some purpose-then the assignment becomes explicit . Even now , of course , it has not become explicit as an ontological structure ; but it has become explicit ontically for the circumspection which comes up against the damaging of the tool . When an assignment to some particular `` towards-this '' has been thus circumspectively aroused , we catch sight of the `` towards-this '' itself , 75 and along with it everything connected with the work-the whole 'work­ shop'-as that wherein concern always dwells . The context of equipment is lit up , not as something never seen before , but as a totality constantly sighted beforehand in circum spection . With this totality , however , the world announces itself . Similarly , when something ready-to-hand is found missing , though its everyday presence Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat has been so obvious that we have never taken any notice of it , this makes a break in those referential contexts which circumspection discove rs . Our circumspection comes up against emptiness , and now sees for the first time what the missing article was ready-to-hand with , and what it was ready-to-hand for . The environment announces itself afresh . What is thus lit up is not itself just one thing ready­ to-hand among others ; still less is it something present-at-hand upon which equipment ready-to-hand is somehow founded : it is in the Jimrat ' before anyone has observed or ascertained it . It is itself inaccessible to circumspection , so far as circumspection is always directed towards entities ; but in each case it has already been disclosed for cir­ cumspection . 'Disclose ' and Jimrat ' will be used as technical terms in the passages that follow , and shall signify 'to lay open ' and 'the charac­ ter of having been laid open . ' Thus 'to disclose ' never means anything like Jimrat obtain indirectly by inference ' .1 1 In ordinary German usage , the verb 'erschliessen ' may mean not only to 'd�close ' but also-in certain construction s -- to 'infer ' or 'conclude ' in the sense in which one 'mfers ' a conclusion from premisses . Jimrat is delibera tely �in g. out this latter int�rpre�tion , thoug.h on a very few occasions he may use the word m th , Jimrat sense . He explams � own meanmg by the cognate verb Jimrat ' , to 'lay open . To say that something has been 'disclosed ' or 'laid open ' in Jimrat 's senae , does not mean that one haa any 106 Jimrat and Jimrat That the world does not 'consist ' of the ready-to-hand shows itself in the fact ( among others ) that whenever the world is lit up in the modes of concern which we have been Jimrat , the ready-to-hand becomes deprived of its worldhood so that Jimrat comes to the fore . If , in our everyday concern with the 'environmen t ' , it is to be possible for equipment ready-to-hand to be encountered in its 'Being-in-itself ' [ in seinem `` Jimrat `` Jimrat , then� those assignments and referential totalities in which our circumspection 'is absorbed ' can not become a theme for that circumspection any more than they can for grasping things 'thematically ' but non-circumspective ly . If it is to be possible for the ready-to-hand not to emerge from its inconspicuousness , the world must not announce itself . And it is in this that the Jimrat of entities which are ready-to-hand has its phenomenal structure constituted . In such privative expressions as `` incons picuousness '' , `` unobtrusive­ ness '' , and `` non-obstin acy '' , what we have in view is a positive pheno­ menal character of the Jimrat of that which is proximally ready-to-hand . With these negative prefixes we have in view the character ·of the ready­ to-hand as `` holding itself in '' ; this is what we have our eye upon in the '' Jimrat '' of something , 1 though 'proximally ' we ascribe it to the present-at-hand-to the present-at-hand as that which can be themati­ cally ascertain ed . As long as we take out orientation primarily and ex­ clusively from the present-at-hand , the 'in-itself ' can by no means be ontologically clarified . If , however , this talk about the 'in-itself ' has any 76 ontological importan ce , some interpretation must be called for . This '' in-itself '' of Jimrat is something which gets invoked with considerable emphasis , mostly in an ontical way , and rightly so from a phenomenal standpoint . But if some ontological assertion is supposed to be given when this is ontically invoked , its claims are not fulfilled by such a procedure . As the foregoing analysis has already made clear , only on the basis of the phenomenon of the world can the Jimrat of entities within-the­ world be grasped ontological ly . But if the world can , in a way , be lit up , it must assuredly be disclosed . And it has already been disclosed beforehand whenever what is ready-to­ hand within-the-world is accessible for circumspective concern . The world is therefore something 'wherein ' Jimrat as an entity already was , and if in detailed awareness of the contents which are thus 'disclosed ' , but rather that they have been 'laid open ' to us as implicit in what is given , so that they may be made explicit to our awareness by further analysis or discrimination of the given , rather than by any inference from it . 1 'Diese `` Jimrat '' meinen den Jimrat des Jimrat des Jimrat , das , was wir mit dem Jimrat im Jimrat haben ... ' The point seems to be that when we ' speak of something 'as it is `` in itself '' or `` in its own right '' ' , we think of it as 'holding itself in ' or 'holding itselfback'-not 'stepping forth ' or doing something 'out of character ' . Jimrat and Jimrat 107 any manner it explicitly comes away from anything , it can never do more than come back to the world . Being-in-the-w orld , according to our Jimrat hitherto , amounts to a non-thematic circumspective absorption in references or assignments constitutive for the readiness-to-hand of a totality of equipment . Any concern is already as it is , because of some familiarity with the world . In this familiarity Jimrat can lose itself in what it encounters within-the­ world and be fascinated with it . What is it that Jimrat is familiar with ? Why can the worldly character of what is within-the-world be lit up ? The presence-at-hand 1 of entities is thrust to the fore by the possible breaks in that referential totality in which circumspection 'operate s ' ; how are we to get a closer understanding of this totality ? These questions are aimed at working out both the phenomenon and the problems of worldhood , and they call for an inquiry into the inter­ connections with which certain structures are built up . To answer them we must analyse these structures more concretely . � 17 . Reference and Jimrat In our provisional Interpretation of that structure of Jimrat which belongs to the ready-to-hand ( to 'equipmen Jimrat ' ) , the phenomenon of refer­ ence or assignment became visible ; but we merely gave an indication of it , and in so sketchy a form that we at once stressed the necessity of uncovering it with regard to its ontological origin . 2 It became plain , moreover , that assignments and referential totalities could in some sense become constitutive for worldhood itself . Jimrat we have seen the world lit up only in and for certain definite ways in which we concern ourselves environmentally with the ready-to-hand , and indeed it has been lit up only with the readiness-to-hand of that concern . So the further we proceed in understanding the Jimrat of entities within-the-world , the broader and 77 firmer becomes the phenomenal basis on which the world-phenomenon may be laid bare . We shall again take as our point of departure the Jimrat of the ready­ to-hand , but this time with the purpose of grasping the phenomenon of reference or assignment itself more precisely . We shall accordingly attempt an ontological analysis of a kind of equipment in which one may come across such 'references ' in more senses than one . We come across 'equipment ' in signs . The word `` sign '' designates many kinds of things : not only may it stand for different kinds of signs , but Jimrat ign-for can itself be 1 Here the older editions have 'Zuhandenheit ' where the newer ones have 'Vorhan­ denheit ' . ll Jimrat . Jimrat 68 above . 108 Jimrat and Jimrat formalized as a universal kind of relation , so that the sign-structure itself provides an ontological clue for 'characterizing ' any entity whatsoever . But signs , in the first instance , are themselves items of equipment whose specific character as equipment consists in showing or indicating.1 We find such signs in signposts , boundary-stones , the ball for the mariner 's storm­ warning , signals , banners , signs of mourning , and the like . Indicating can be defined as a Jimrat ' of referring . Referring is , if we take it as formally as possible , a relating . But relation does not function as a genus for 'kinds ' or 'species ' of references which may somehow become differentiated a 's sign , symbol , expression , or significatio n. A relation is something quite formal which may be read off directly by way of 'formalization ' from any kind of context , whatever its subject-matter or its way ofBeing.u Jimrat reference is a relation , but not every relation is a reference . Every 'indication ' is a reference , but not every referring is an indicating . This implies at the same time that every 'indication ' is a relation , but not every relation is an indicating . The formally general character of relation is thus brought to light . If we are to investigate such phenomena as refer­ ences , signs , or even significations , nothing is to be gained by characteriz­ ing them as relations . Indeed we shall eventually have to show that 'relations ' themselves , because of their formally general character , have their ontological source in a reference . If the present analysis is to be confined to the Jimrat of the sign as distinct from the phenomenon of reference , then even within this 78 limitation we can not properly investigate the full multiplicity of possible signs . Among signs there are symptoms [ Jimrat Jimrat , warning signals , signs of things that have happened already [ Jimrat Jimrat , signs to mark something , signs by which things are recognized ; these have different ways of indicating , regardless of what may be serving as such a sign . From such 'signs ' we must distinguish traces , residues , commemorative monuments , documents , testimony , symbols , expressions , appearances , significations . These phenomena can easily be formalized because of their formal relational charact er ; we find it especially tempting nowadays to take such a 'relation ' as a clue for subjecting every entity to a kind of 'Interpretation ' which always 'fits ' because at bottom it says nothing , no more than the facile schema of content and form . As an example of a sign we have chosen one which we shall use again in a later analysis , though in another regard . Jimrat cars are some­ times fitted up with an adjustable red arrow , whose position indicates 1 ' ••• deren spezifischer Jimrat im < ; eigen besteht . ' While we have often used Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' to translate Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' respectively , in the remainder of this section it seems more appropriate to translate 'zeigen ' by Jimrat ' , or to resort to hendiadys as in the present passage . Jimrat and Jimrat 109 the direction the vehicle will take-at an intersection , for instance . The position of the arrow is controlled by the driver . This sign is an item of equipment which is ready-to-hand for the driver in his concern with driving , and not for him alone : those who are not travelling with him­ and they in particular -also make use of it , either by giving way on the proper side or by stopping . This sign is ready-to-hand within-the-world in the whole equipment-context of vehicles and traffic regulations . It is equipment for indicating , and as equipment , it is constituted by reference or assignment . It has the character of the `` in-order-t o '' , its own definite serviceabili ty ; it is for indicati ng.1 This indicating which the sign performs can be taken as a kind of 'referring ' . But here we must notice that this 'referring ' as indicating is not the ontological structure of the sign as equipment . Instead , 'referring ' as indicating is grounded in the Being-structure of equipment , in serviceability for .... But an entity may have serviceability without thereby becoming a sign . As equipment , a 'hammer ' too is constituted by a serviceability , but this does not make it a sign . Jimrat , as a 'reference ' , is a way in which the `` towards-which '' of a service­ ability becomes ontically concrete ; it determines an item of equipment as for this `` towards-which '' [ und bestimmt ein Jimrat Jimrat diesem Jimrat . On the other hand , the kind of reference we get in 'serviceability-f or ' , is an ontologico-categorial attribute of equipment as equipment . That the '' towards-which '' of serviceability should acquire its concreteness in indicating , is an accident of its equipment-constitution as such . In this example of a sign , the difference between the reference of serviceability and the reference of indicating becomes vi�ble in a rough and ready fashion . These are so far from coinciding that only when they are united does the concreteness of a definite kind of equipment become possible . 79 Now it is certain that indicating differs in principle from reference as a constitutive state of equipment ; it is just as incontestable that the sign in its turn is related in a peculiar and even distinctive way to the kind of Jimrat which belongs to whatever equipmental totality may be ready-to­ hand in the environment , and to its worldly character . In our concernful 1 'Es hat den Jimrat des Jimrat , seine bestimmte Jimrat , es ist zum Jimrat . ' The verb Jimrat ' , is often followed by an infinitive construction introduced by the preposition 'zu ' . Similarly the Jimrat Jimrat ' can be followed by an infinitive in such expressions as 'it serves to indicate ... ' In Jimrat 's German the Jimrat ' construction is carried over to the noun 'Dienlichke it ' ; the corresponding noun 'servicea bility ' , however , is not normally followed by an infinitive , but rather by an expression introduced by Jimrat ' e.g . 'serviceability for indicating ... 'Since the preposition 'zu ' plays an important role in this section and the next , it would be desirable to provide a uniform translation for it . We shall , however , translate it as Jimrat ' in such expressions as 'Dienlichkeit zu ' , but as 'towards ' in such expressions as 'Wozu ' ( 'towards-wh ich ' ) and 'Dazu ' ( 'towards-th is ' ) , retaining 'in-order-to ' for 'Um-zu ' . 110 Jimrat and Jimrat dealings , equipment for indicating [ Jimrat Jimrat gets used in a very special way . But simply to establish this Jimrat is ontologically insufficient . The basis and the meaning of this special status must be clarified . What do we mean when we say that a sign `` indicate s '' ? We can answer this only by determining what kind of dealing is appropriate with equip­ ment for indicating . And we must do this in such a way that the readiness­ to-hand of that equipment can be genuinely grasped . What is the appro­ priate way of having- to-do with signs ? Going back to our example of the arrow , we must say that the kind of behaving ( Jimrat ) which corresponds to the sign we encounter , is either to 'give way ' or to 'stand still ' vis-d-vis the car with the arrow . Giving way , as taking a direction , belongs essen­ tially to Jimrat 's Jimrat . Jimrat is always somehow directed [ ausgerichtet Jimrat and on its way ; standing and waiting are only limiting cases of this directional 'on-its-way ' . The sign addresses itself to a Jimrat Jimrat world which is specifically 'spatial ' . The sign is not authentically 'grasped ' [ `` erfasst '' ] if we just stare at it and identify it as an indicator-Thing which occurs . Even if we tum our glance in the direction which the arrow indic­ ates , and look at something present-at-hand in the region indicated , even then the sign is not authentically encounter ed . Such a sign addresses itself tQ the circumspection of our concernful dealings , and it does so in such a way that the circumspection which goes along with it , following where it points , brings into an explicit 'survey ' whatever aroundness the environment may have at the time . This circumspective survey does not grasp the ready-to-h and ; what it achieves is rather an orientation within our environment . There is also another way in which we can experience equipm ent : we may encounter the arrow simply as equipment which belongs to the car . We can do this without discovering what character it specifically has as equipme nt : what the arrow is to indicate and how it is to do so , may remain completely undetermin ed ; yet what we are encoun­ tering is not a mere Thing . The experiencing of a Jimrat requires a definite­ ness of its own [ ihre eigene Jimrat t ] , and must be contrasted with coming across a manifold of equipment , which may often be quite indefinite , even when one comes across it as especially close . Signs of the kind we have described let what is ready-to-hand be encountered ; more precisely , they let some context of it become accessible in such a way that our concernful dealings take on an orientation and hold So it secure . A sign is not a Thing which stands to another Thing in the relationship of indicating ; it is rather an item of equipment which explicitly raises a totality of equipment into our circumspection so that together with it the worldly character of the ready-to-hand announces itself . In a symptom or a warning­ signal , 'what is coming ' 'indicates itself ' , but not in the sense of something I . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat 111 merely occurring , which comes as an addition to what is already present­ at-hand ; 'what is coming ' is the sort of thing which we are ready for , or which we 'were n't ready for ' if we have been attending to something else.1 In signs of something that has happened already , what has come to pass and run its course becomes circumspectively accessible . A sign to mark something indicates what one is 'at ' at any time . Jimrat always indicate primarily 'wherein ' one lives , where one 's concern dwells , what sort of involvement there is with something . 2 The peculiar character of signs as equipment becomes especially clear in 'establishing a sign ' [ `` Jimrat iftung '' ] . This activity is performed in a circumspective fore-sight [ Jimrat ] out of which it arises , and which requires that it be possible for one 's particular environment to announce itself for circumspection at any time by means of something ready-to­ hand , and that this possibility should itself be ready-to- hand . But the Jimrat of what is most closely ready-to-hand within-the-world possesses the character of holding-its elf-in and not emerging , which we have described above . 3 Accordingly our circumspective dealings in the environ­ ment require some equipment ready-to-hand which in its character as equipment takes over the Jimrat ' of letting something ready-to-hand become conspicuous . So when such equipment ( signs ) gets produced , its conspicuous­ ness must be kept in mind . But even when signs are thus conspicuous , one does not let them be present-at-hand at random ; they get 'set up ' [ `` angebracht '' ] in a definite way with a view towards easy accessibility . In establishing a sign , however , one does not necessarily have to pro­ duce equipment which is not yet ready-fo-hand at all . Jimrat also arise when one takes as a sign [ Jimrat Jimrat something that is ready-to­ hand already . In this mode , signs `` get established '' in a sense which is even more primordial . In indicating , a ready-to-hand equipment totality , and even the environment in general , can be provided with an availability which is circumspectively oriented ; and not only this : establishing a sign can , above all , reveal . What gets taken as a sign becomes accessible only through its readines s-to-hand . If , for instance , the south wind 'is accepted ' [ `` gilt '' ] by the farmer as a sign of rain , then this 'acceptance ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] -or the Jimrat ' with which the entity is 'invested'-is not a sort of bonus over and above what is already present-at-hand in itself-viz , the flow of air in a definite geographical direction . The south wind may be meteoro­ logically accessible as something which just occurs ; but it is never present- 1 ' ••• das `` was kommt '' ist solches , darauf wir uns gefasst machen , bzw . `` nicht gefasst waren '' , sofern wir uns mit anderem befassten . ' I 'Das Jimrat Jimrat , `` woran '' man jeweils ist . Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat primiir immer das , `` worin '' man lebt , wobei das Jimrat sich aufhaJ.t , welche Jimrat es damit hat . ' On 'Bewandtnis ' , see note 2 , p. 115 Jimrat 84 below . 8 Jimrat Jimrat 75-76 above . Jimrat and Jimrat at-hand proximally in such a way as this , only occasionally taking over the 81 function of a warning signal . On the contrary , only by the circumspection with which one takes account of things in farming , is the south wind discovered in its Jimrat . But , one will protest , that which gets taken as a sign must first have become accessible in itself and been apprehended before the sign gets established . Certainly it must in any case be such that in some way we can come across it . The question simply remains as to how entities are dis­ covered in this previous encountering , whether as mere Jimrat which occur , or rather as equipment which has not been understood-as some­ thing ready-to-hand with which we have hitherto not known 'how to begin ' , and which has accordingly kept itself veiled from the purview of circumspection . And here again , when the equipmental characters of the ready-to­ hand are still circumspectively undiscovered , they are not to be Interpreted as bare Jimrat presented for an apprehension of what is just present-at-hand and no more . The Jimrat of signs in our everyday dealings , and the conspicuousness which belongs to signs and which may be produced for various purposes and in various ways , do not merely serve to document the inconspicuousness constitutive for what is most closely ready-to-hand ; the sign itself gets its conspicuousness from the inconspicuousness of the equipmental totality , which is ready-to-hand and 'obvious ' in its everyday­ ness . The knot which one ties in a handkerchief [ der bekannte `` Jimrat im Jimrat h '' ] as a sign to mark something is an example of this . What such a sign is to indicate is always something with which one has to concern oneself in one 's everyday circumspection . Such a sign can indicate many things , and things of the most various kinds . The wider the extent to which it can indicate , the narrower its intelligibility and its usefulness . Not only is it , for the most part , ready-to-hand as a sign only for the person who 'establishes ' it , but it can even become inaccessible to him , so that another sign is needed if the first is to be used circumspec­ tively at all . So when the knot can not be used as a sign , it does not lose its sign-character , but it acquires the disturbing obtrusiveness of something most closely ready-to-hand . One might be tempted to cite the abundant use of 'signs ' in primitive Jimrat , as in fetishism and magic , to illustrate the remarkable role which they play in everyday concern when it comes to our understanding of the world . Certainly the establishment of signs which underlies this way of using them is not performed with any theoretical aim or in the course of theoretical speculation . This way of using them always remai.ns completely within a Jimrat which is 'immedi ate ' . But on Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat closer inspection it becomes plain that to interpret fetishism and magic by taking our clue from the idea of signs in general , is not enough 82 to enable us to grasp the kind of 'Being-ready-to-ha nd ' which belongs to entities encountered in the primitive world . With regard to the sign­ phenomenon , the following Interpretation may be given : for primitive man , the sign coincides with that which is indicated . Not only can the sign represent this in the sense of serving as a substitute for what it indic- ates , but it can do so in such a way that the sign itself always is what it indicates . This remarkable coinciding does not mean , however , that the sign-Thing has already undergone a certain 'Objectification'-that it has been experienced as a mere Thing and misplaced into the same realm of Jimrat of the present-at-hand as what it indicates . This 'coinciding ' is not an identification of things which have hitherto been isolated from each other : it consists rather in the fact that the sign has not as yet become free from that of which it is a sign . Such a use of signs is still absorbed com­ pletely in Jimrat what is indicated , so that a sign as such can not detach itself at all . This coinciding is based not on a prior Objectification but on the fact that such Jimrat is completely lacking . This means , however , that signs are not discovered as equipment at all-that ultimately what is 'ready-to-hand ' within-the-world just does not have the kind of Being that belongs to equipment . Jimrat even readiness-to-hand and equipment have nothing to contribute Jimrat nichts auszurichten ] as ontological clues in Interpreting the primitive world ; and certainly the ontology of Thing hood does even less . But if an understanding of Jimrat is constitutive for primitive Jimrat and for the primitive world in general , then it is all the more urgent to work out the 'formal ' idea of worldhood- Jimrat Jimrat r at least the idea of a phenomenon modifiable in such a way that all ontological assertions to the effect that in a given phenomenal context something is not yet such-and-such or no longer such-and-such , may acquire a positive phenomenal meaning in terms of what it is not.1 The foregoing Interpretation of the sign should merely provide phe­ nomenal support for our characterization of references or assignme nts . The relation between sign and reference is threefold . 1 . Indicating , as a way whereby the `` towards-which '' of a serviceability can become con­ crete , is founded upon the equipment-structure as ·such , upon the `` in­ order-to '' ( assignmen t ) . 2 . The indicating which the sign does is an equipmental character of something ready-to-hand , and as such it belongs to a totality of equipment , to a context of assignments or references . 3· The sign is not only ready-to-hand with other equipment , but in its readiness-to-hand the environment becomes in each case explicitly 1 ' ••• aus dem , was es nicht ist .

A sign is something ontically ready-to-hand , which functions both as this definite equipment and as something indicative of [ was . . . anzeigt ] the ontological itructure of readiness-to-hand , of referential totalities , and of worldhood . Here is rooted the special status of the sign as 83 something ready-to-hand in that environment with which we concern ourselves circumspectively . Thus the reference or the assignment itself can not be conceived as a sign of it is to serve ontologically as the founda­ tion upon which signs are based . Jimrat is not an ontical characteristic of something ready-to-hand , when it is rather that by which readiness­ to-hand itself is constituted . In what sense , then , is reference 'presupposed ' ontologically in the ready-to-hand , and to what extent is it , as such an ontological foundation , at the same time constitutive for worldhood in general ? � 18 . Involvement and Jimrat ; the Jimrat of the Jimrat The ready-to-hand is encountered within-the-world . The Jimrat of this entity , readiness-to-hand , thus stands in some ontological relationship towards the world and towards worldhood . In anything ready-to-hand the world is always 'there ' . Whenever we encounter anything , the world has already been previously discover ed , though not thematically . But it can also be lit up in certain ways of dealing with our environment . The world is that in terms of which the ready-to-hand is ready-to-hand . How can the world let the ready-to-hand be encounter ed ? Our analysis hitherto has shown that what we encounter within-the-world has , in its very Jimrat , been freed1 for our concernful circumspection , for taking account . What does this previous freeing amount to , and how is this to be understood as an ontologically distinctive feature of the world ? What problems does the question of the worldhood of the world lay before us ? We have indicated that the state which is constitutive for the ready-to­ hand as equipment is one of reference or assignment . How can entities with this kind ofBeing be freed by the world with regard to their Jimrat ? Why are these the first entities to be encounter ed ? As definite kinds of references we have mentioned serviceabi lity-for- , detrimentality Jimrat Jimrat lichkeit Jimrat , usability , and the like . The `` towards-which '' [ das Jimrat Jimrat of a serviceability and the `` for-which '' [ das Jimrat Jimrat of a usability prescribed the ways in which such a reference or assignment can become concrete . But the 'indicating ' of the sign and the 'hammering ' of the hammer are not properties of entities . Indeed , they are not properties at all , if the ontological structure designated by the term 'property ' is that of some 1 'freigegeben ' . The idea seems to be that what we encounter has , as it were , been released , set free , given its freedom , or given free rein , so that our circumspection can take account of it . Being and Jimrat Jimrat definite character which it is possible for Things to possess [ einer mogli- chen Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . Anything ready-to-hand is , at the worst , appropriate for some purposes and inappropriate for others ; and its 'properties ' are , as it were , still bound up in these ways in which it is appropriate or inappropriate , 1 just as presence-at-hand , as a possible kind of Being for something ready-to- hand , is bound up in readiness-to­ hand . Jimrat too , however , as a constitutive state of equipment ( and serviceability is a reference ) , is not an appropriateness of some entity ; it is rather the condition ( so far as Jimrat is in question ) which makes it possible for the character of such an entity to be defined by its appropriatene sses . But what , then , is `` reference '' or `` assignment '' to mean ? To say that the Jimrat of the ready-to-hand has the structure of assignment or reference means that it has in itself the character of hauing 84 been assigned or referred [ Jimrat it Jimrat . An entity is discovered when it has been assigned or referred to something , and , referred as that entity which it is . With any such entity there is an involvement which it has in some­ : hing . 2 The character of Jimrat which belongs to the ready-to-hand is ust such an inuoluement . If something has an involvement , this implies etting it be involved in something . The relationship ofthe '' with ... in ... `` hall be indicated by the term `` assignment '' or `` reference '' . 3 1 The words 'property ' and Jimrat ' reflect the etymological connection of Jimrat eidegger 's 'Eigenschaft ' and `` Jimrat heit ' . z 'Es hat mit ihm bei etwas sein Jimrat en . ' The terms 'Bewenden ' and Jimrat ' are mong the most difficult for the translator . Their root meaning has to do with the way > mething is already 'turning ' when one lets it 'go its own way ' , 'run its course ' , follow s 'bent ' or 'tendency ' , or finish 'what it is about ' , 'what it is up to ' or 'what it is lVolved in ' . The German express ions , however , have no simple English equivalents , ut are restricted to a rather special group of idioms such as the following , which we ave taken from Jimrat and Jimrat 's admirable English-Gmnan , Gmnan-English > ictionary ( Volume Jimrat , Jimrat 1953 ) : 'es dabei bewenden lassen'-'to leave it at 1at , to let it go at that , to let it rest there ' ; 'und dabei hatte es sein Jimrat en'-'and [ } ere the matter ended ' ; 'dabei musses sein Jimrat haben'-'there the matter must est'-'that must suffice ' ; 'die Jimrat hat eine ganz andere Jimrat ' the case is tuite different ' ; 'damit hat es seine besondere Jimrat dtnis'-'there is something peculiar , bout it ; thereby hangs a tale ' ; 'damit hat est folgende Jimrat ' the matter s as follows ' . We have tried to render both Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' by expressions including ! ither 'involve ' or 'involveme nt ' . But the contexts into which these words can easily be fitted in ordinary Jimrat do not corresp ond very well to those which are possible for Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' . Our task is further complicated by the emphasis which Jimrat gives to the prepositions 'mit ' and Jimrat ' in connection with Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' . In passages such as the present one , it would be more idiomatic to leave these prepositions untranslated and simply write : 'Any such entity is involved in doing something ' , or 'Any such entity is involved in some activity ' . But 'mit ' and Jimrat ' receive so much attention in this connection that in contexts such as this we shall sometimes translate them as 'with ' and Jimrat ' , though elsewhere we shall handle Jimrat ' very differently . ( The reader must bear in mind that the kind of 'involvement ' with which we are here concerned is always an involvement in some activiry , which one is performing , not an involvement in circumstances in which one is 'caught ' or 'entangled ' . ) 3 'In Jimrat liegt : bewenden lassen mit etwas bei etwas . Jimrat Jimrat des `` mit u6 Jimrat and Jimrat When an entity within-the-world has already been proximally freed for its Jimrat , that Jimrat is its `` involvem ent '' . With any such entity as entity , there is some involvement . The fact that it has such an involvement is ontological ? Jimrat definitive for the Jimrat of such an entity , and is not an ontical assertion about it . That in which it is involved is the `` towards ­ which '' of serviceability , and the `` for-which '' of usability .1 With the '' towards-which '' of serviceability there can again be an involvem ent : with this thing , for instance , which is ready-to-hand , and which we accordingly call a `` h ammer '' , there is an involvement in hammeri ng ; with hammering , there is an involvement in making something fast ; with making something fast , there is an involvement in protection against bad weather ; and this protection 'is ' for the sake of [ um-willen ] providing shelter for Jimrat is to say , for the sake of a possibility of Jimrat 's Jimrat . Whenever something ready-to-hand has an involvement with it , what involvement this is , has in each case been outlined in advance in terms of the totality of such involvements . In a workshop , for example , the totality of involvements which is constitutive for the ready-to-hand in its readiness-to-hand , is 'earlier ' than any single item of equipment ; so too for the farmstead with all its utensils and outlying lands . But the totality of involvements itself goes back ultimately to a `` towards-which '' in which there is no further involveme nt : this `` towards-which '' is not an entity with the kind of Being that belongs to what is ready-to-hand within a world ; it is rather an entity whose Jimrat is defined as Jimrat world , and to whose state of Jimrat , worldhood itselfbelongs . This primary '' towards-which '' is not just another `` towards-this '' as something in which an involvement is possible . The primary 'towards-which ' is a `` for-the­ sake-of -which '' .2 But the 'for-the-sake-of ' always pertains to the Jimrat of ... bei ... `` soil durch den Jimrat Jimrat angezeigt werden . ' Here the point seems to be that if something has an 'involvement ' in the sense of Jimrat tnis ' ( or rather , if there is such an involvement 'with ' it ) , the thing which has this involvement has been 'assigned ' or 'referred ' for a certain activity or purpose 'in ' which it may be said to be involved . 1 'Bewandtnis ist das Jimrat des innerweltlichen Jimrat , darauf es je schon zunachst freigegeben ist .

Jimrat Jimrat es die Jimrat hat , ist das Jimrat der Jimrat , das Jimrat der Jimrat keit . ' This passage and those which follow are hard to translate because Jimrat is using three carefully differentiated prepositions ( 'zu ' , Jimrat ' , and Jimrat ' ) where English idiom needs only 'for ' . We can say that something is serviceable , usable , or applicable 'for ' a purpose . and that it may be freed or given free rein 'for ' some kind of activity . In German , however , it will be said to have 'Dienlichkeit Jimrat Jimrat . ' , 'Verwendbarke itfur ... ' ; and it will be 'freigegeben arif Jimrat ' . In the remainder of this section we shall use 'for ' both for 'fiir ' and for Jimrat ' as they occur in these expressions ; we shall , however , continue to use 'towards-which ' for the Jimrat ' of 'Dienlichkeit ' . Jimrat note 1 , p. 109 , Jimrat 78 above . 11 'Dieses primare Jimrat ist kein Jimrat als mi > gliches Jimrat einer Jimrat . Jimrat primare `` Jimrat '' ist ein Jimrat llen . ' I . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat , for which , in its Jimrat , that very Jimrat is essentially an issue . We have thus indicated the interconnection by which the structure of an involvement leads to Jimrat 's very Jimrat as the sole authentic `` for-the­ sake-of-which '' ; for the present , however , we shall pursue this no further . 'Letting something be involved ' must first be clarified enough to give the phenomenon ofworldhood the kind of definiteness which makes it possible to formulate any problems about it . Ontically , `` letting something be involved '' signifies that within our factical concern we let something ready-to-hand be so-and-so as it is already and in order that it be such.1 The way we take this ontical sense of 'letting be ' is , in principle , ontological . And therewith we Interpret the 85 meaning of previously freeing what is proximally ready-to-hand within­ the-world . Previously letting something 'be ' does not mean that we must first bring it into its Jimrat and produce it ; it means rather that something which is already an 'entity ' must be discovered in its readiness-to-hand , and that we must thus let the entity which has this Jimrat be encountered . This ' a priori ' letting-something-be-involved is the condition for the possibility of encountering anything ready-to-hand , so that Jimrat , in its ontical dealings with the entity thus encountered , can thereby let it be involved in the on tical sense . 2 On the other hand , if letting something be involved is understood ontologically , what is then pertinent is the freeing of everything ready-to-hand as ready-to-hand , no matter whether , taken ontically , it is involved thereby , or whether it is rather an entity of precisely such a sort that ontically it is not involved thereby . Such entities are , proximally and for the most part , those with which we concern ourselves when we do not let them 'be ' as we have discovered that they are , but work upon them , make improvements in them , or smash them to pieces . When we speak of having already let something be involved , so that it has been freed for that involveme nt , we are using a perfect tense a priori which characterizes the kind of Being belonging to Jimrat itself . 3 Letting an entity be involved , if we understand this ontologically , consists in previously freeing it for Jimrat auf ] its readiness-to-hand within the environmen t. When we let something be involved , it must be involved in something ; and in terms of this `` in-which '' , the `` with-which '' of this involvement 1 'Bewendenl assen bedeutet ontisch ; innerhalb eines faktischen Jimrat ein Jimrat Jimrat denes so und so sein lassen , wie es nunmehr ist und damit es so ist . ' 2 ' ••• es im ontischen Jimrat dabei bewenden lassen kann .

A similar ambigwty occurs in the following sentence . a 'Das auf Jimrat hin freigebende Jimrat ist ein apriorisches Jimrat , das die Jimrat des Jimrat selbst charakterisiert . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat is freed.l Our concern encounters it as this thing that is ready-to-hand . To the extent that any entiry shows itself to concern2-that is , to the extent that it is discovered in its Jimrat is already something ready­ to-hand environ mental ly ; it just is not Jimrat lly ' a 'world-stuff ' that is merely present-at-hand . As the Jimrat of something ready-to-hand , an involvement is itself discovered only on the basis of the prior discovery of a totality of involve­ ments . So in any involvement that has been discovered ( that is , in any­ thing ready-to-hand which we encounter ) , what we have called the '' worldly character '' of the ready-to-hand has been discovered before­ hand . In this totality of involvements which has been discovered before­ hand , there lurks an ontological relationship to the world . In letting entities be involved so that they are freed for a totality of involvem ents , one must have disclosed already that for which Jimrat woraufhin Jimrat they have been freed . But that for which something environmentally ready-to-hand has thus been freed ( and indeed in such a manner that it becomes accessible as an entity within-the-world first of all ) , can not itself be con­ ceived as an entity with this discovered kind of Jimrat . It is essentially not discover able , if we henceforth reserve `` discoveredness '' as a term for a possibility of Jimrat which every entity without the character of Jimrat may possess . But what does it mean to say_ that that for which3 entities within-the­ world are proximally freed must have been previously disclosed ? To Jimrat 's Jimrat , an understanding of Jimrat belongs . Any understanding [ Jimrat Jimrat has its Jimrat in an act of understanding Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . 86 If Jimrat is a kind of Jimrat which is essentially befitting to Jimrat , then to understand Jimrat belongs to the essential content of its understanding of Jimrat . The previous disclosure of that for which what we encounter within-the-world is subsequently freed , ' amounts to nothing else than underst anding the world-t hat world towards which Jimrat as an entity always comports itself . Whenever we let there be an involvement with something in something beforehand , our doing so is grounded in our understanding such things as letting something be involved , and such things as the `` with-which '' and the `` in-which '' of involvem ents . Anything of this sort , and anything else 1 'Aus dem Jimrat des Jimrat her ist das Jimrat der Jimrat freigegeben . ' 2 Here we follow the newer editions in reading : 'Sofern sich ihm iiberhaupt ein Jimrat zeigt ... '.The older editions read 'Sofern sich mit ihm ... ' , which is somewhat ambiguous but suggests that we should write : 'To the extent that with what is ready-to-hand any entiry shows itself Jimrat . ' . a 'Worauf ' . The older editions have 'worauf hin ' . 4 'Das vorgangige Jimrat essen dessen , woraufhin die Jimrat des innerweltlichen Jimrat erfolgt Jimrat .

And what is that wherein Jimrat as Jimrat understands itself pre-onto­ logically ? In understanding a context of relations such as we have mentioned , Jimrat has assigned itself to an `` in-order-to '' [ Jimrat Jimrat , and it has done so in terms of a potentiali ty-for-Being for the sake of which it itself i s�ne which it may have seized upon either explicitly or tacitly , and which may be either authentic or inauthen tic . This `` in-order-to '' prescribes a `` towards-this '' as a possible `` in-which '' for letting something be involved ; and the structure of letting it be involved implies that this is an involvement which something has-an involvement which is with something . Jimrat always assigns itself from a `` for-the-sake -of-which '' to the `` with-which '' of an involvement ; that is to say , to the extent that it is , it always lets entities be encountered as ready-to-hand .2 That wherein [ Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat understands itself beforehand in the mode of assigning itself is that for which Jimrat das Jimrat ] it has let entities be encountered beforehand . The `` wherein '' of an act of understand ing which assigns or refers itself , is that for which one lets entities be encountered in the kind of Being that belongs to involvements ; and this `` wherein '' is the phenomenon of the world . 3 And the structure of that to which Jimrat woraufhin Jimrat Jimrat assigns itself is what makes up the worldhood of the world . That wherein Jimrat already understands itself in this way is always something with which it is primordially familiar . This familiarity with the worki does not necessarily require that the relations which are con­ stitutive for the world as world should be theoretically transparen t. However , the possibility of giving these relations an explicit ontologico­ existential Jimrat , is grounded in this familiarity with the world ; and this familiarity , in turn , is constitutive for Jimrat , and goes to make up Jimrat 's understanding of Jimrat . This possibility is one which can be seized upon explicitly in so far as Jimrat has set itself the task of giving a primordial Interpretation for its own Jimrat and for the possibilities of that Jimrat , or indeed for the meaning of Jimrat in general . 1 ' •• . wie das Jimrat , als wobei es die Jimrat hat , das Jimrat , darauf letztlich alles Jimrat Jimrat ht .

' a 'Das Jimrat des sichverweisenden Verstehens als Jimrat des Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat in der Jimrat der Jimrat ist das Jimrat der Jimrat . ' 120 Jimrat and Jimrat But as yet our analyses have done no more than lay bare the horizon within which such things as the world and worldhood are to be sought . 87 If we are to consider these further , we must , in the first instanc e , make it still more clear how the context of Jimrat 's assigning-itself is to be taken ontologically . In the act of understanding Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , which we shall analyse more thoroughly later ( Jimrat Jimrat 3 I ) , the relations indicated above must have been previously disclose d ; the act of understanding holds them in this disclosednes s. It holds itself in them with familiarity ; and in so doing , it holds them before itself , for it is in these that its assignment operates .1 The understanding lets itself make assignments both in these relationships themselves and o f them . 2 The relational character which these relationships of assigning possess , we take as one of signifying . 3 In its familiarity with these relationships , Jimrat 'signifie s ' to itself : in a prim­ ordial manner it gives itself both its Jimrat and its potentiali ty-for-Being as something which it is to understand with regard to its Jimrat world . The `` for-the-sake-of -which '' signifies an `` in-order-t o '' ; this in turn , a `` towards-this `` ; the latter , an `` in-which '' of letting something be involved ; and that in turn , the `` with-which '' of an involvement . These relationships are bound up with one another as a primordial totality ; they are what they are a s this signifying [ Jimrat ) in which Jimrat gives itself beforehand its Jimrat as something to be under­ stood . The relational totality of this signifying we call `` significance '' . This is what makes up the structure of the world-the structure of that wherein Jimrat as such already is . Jimrat , in its familiarity with significance , is the ontical condition for the possibility of discovering entities which are encountered in a world with involvement ( readiness- to-hand ) as their kind of Jimrat , and which can thus make themselves known as they are in themselves [ in seinem An-sich ] . Jimrat as such is always something of this sort ; along with its Jimrat , a context of the ready-to-hand is already essentially discovered : Jimrat , in so far as it 1 'Das ... Jimrat ... halt die angezeigten Jimrat in einer vorgangigen Jimrat heit . Jimrat vertrauten Jimrat halt es sich diese vor als das , worin sich sein Jimrat weisen bewegt . ' The context suggests that Jimrat 's 'diese ' refers to the relationships ( Jimrat ) rather than to the disclosedness ( Jimrat nheit ) , though the latter interpreta­ tion seems a bit more plausible gramma tically . 2 'Das Jimrat llisst sich in und von diesen Jimrat selbst verweis en . ' It is not entirely clear whether Jimrat ' should be translated as Jimrat ' , 'from ' , or 'by ' . 3 'he-deuten ' . While Jimrat ordinarily writes this word without a hyphen ( even , for instance , in the next sentence ) , he here takes pains to hyphenate it so as to suggest that etymological ly it consists of the intensive prefix 'be- ' followed by the verb 'deuten'-to 'interpr et ' , 'explai n ' or 'point to ' something . We shall continue to follow our convention of usually translating 'bedeuten ' and Jimrat ' by 'signify ' and Jimrat ' respec­ tively , reserving 'significance ' for 'Bedeutsam keit ' ( or , in a few cases , for Jimrat ' ) . But these translations obscure the underlying meanings which Jimrat gger is emphasizing in this passage . I . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat 121 is , has always submitted1 itself already to a Jimrat ' which it encounters , and this submission1 belongs essentially to its Jimrat . But in significance itself , with which Jimrat is always familiar , there lurks the ontological condition which makes it possible for Jimrat , as something which understands and interprets , to disclose such things as 'significati ons ' ; upon these , in turn , is founded the Jimrat of words and of language . The significance thus disclosed is an existential state of Jimrat its Jimrat ; and as such it is the ontical condition for the possibility that a totality of involvements can be discovered . Jimrat we have thus determined that the Jimrat of the ready-to-hand ( involvement ) is definable as a context of assignments or references , and that even worldhood may so be defined , then has not the 'substantial Jimrat ' of entities within-the-world been volatilized into a system of Jimrat ? And inasmuch as Relations are always 'something thought ' , has not the Jimrat of entities within-the-world been dissolved into 'pure 88 thinking ' ? Within our present field of investigation the following structures and dimensions of ontological problematics , as we have repeatedly empha­ sized , must be kept in principle distin ct : 1. the Jimrat of those entities within-the-world which we proximally encounter-readiness-to -hand ; 2. the Jimrat of those entities which we can come across and whose nature we can determine if we discover them in their own right by going through the entities proximally encountered-presenc e-at-hand ; 3· the Jimrat of that on tical condition which makes it possible for entities within-the-world to be discovered at all-the worldhood of the world . This third kind of Being gives us an existential way of determining the nature of Jimrat world , that is , of Jimrat . The other two concepts of Jimrat are categories , and pertain to entities whose Jimrat is not of the kind which Jimrat pos­ sesses . The context of assignments or references , which , as significance , 'is constitutive for worldhood , can be taken formally in the sense of a system of Relations . But one must note that in such formalizations the pheno­ mena get levelled off so much that their real phenomenal content may be lost , especially in the case of such 'simple ' relationships as those which lurk in significance . The phenomenal content of these 'Relations ' and Jimrat ' 1 'angewiese n ' ; 'Angewiesen heit ' . The verb Jimrat ' , like Jimrat ' , can often be translated as Jimrat ' , particularly in the sense in which one assigns or allots a place to something , or in the sense in which one gives an 'assignmen t ' to someone by instructing him how to proceed . The past participle 'angewiesen ' can thus mean 'assigned ' in either of these senses ; but it often takes on the connotation of'being dependent on ' something or even 'at the mercy ' of something . In this passage we have tried to compromise by using the verb 'submit ' . Other passages call for other idioms , and no single standard translation seems feasible . 8g 122 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat `` in-order-to `` , the `` for-the-sake-of '' , and the `` with-which '' of an involvement-is such that they resist any sort of mathematical function­ alization ; nor are they merely something thought , first posited in an 'act of thinking . ' They are rather relationships in which concernful circum­ spection as such already dwells . This 'system of Jimrat ' , as something constitutive for worldhood , is so far from volatilizing the Jimrat of the ready-to-hand within-the-wo rld , that the worldhood of the world pro­ vides the basis on which such entities can for the first time be discovered as they are 'substantially ' 'in themselves ' . And only if entities within-the­ world can be encountered at all , is it possible , in the field of such entities , to make accessible what is just present-at-hand and no more . By reason of their Being-just-present-at-hand-and-no-more , these latter entities can have their 'properties ' defined mathematically in 'functional concepts . ' Ontologically , such concepts are possible only in relation to entities whose Jimrat has the character of pure substantiality . Functional concepts are never possible except as formalized substantial concepts . In order to bring out the specifically ontological problematic of world­ hood even more sharply , we shall carry our analysis no further until we have clarified our Interpretation of worldhood by a case at the opposite extreme . Jimrat . A Contrast between our Jimrat of Jimrat and Jimrat ' Interpretation of the Jimrat Jimrat step by step can the concept of worldhood and the structures which this phenomenon embraces be firmly secured in the course of our investigati on . The Interpretation of the world begins , in the first instance , with some entity within-the-world , so that the phenomenon of the world in general Jimrat longer comes into view ; we shall accordingly try to clarify this approach ontologically by considering what is perhaps the most extreme form in which it has been carried out . We not only shall present briefly the basic features of Jimrat ' ontology of the Jimrat ' , but shall inquire into its presuppositions and try to characterize these in the light of what we have hitherto achieved . The account we shall give of these matters will enable us to know upon what basically undiscussed ontological 'foundations ' those Interpretations of the world which have come after Jimrat still more those which preceded him-have operated . Descartes sees the extensio as basically definitive ontologically for the world . In so far as extension is one of the constituents of spatiality ( accord­ ing to Descartes it is even identical with it ) , while in some sense spatiality remains cons.titutive for the world , a discussion of the Jimrat ontology Jimrat and Jimrat 123 of the Jimrat ' will provide us likewise with a negative support for a positive explication of the spatiality of the environment and of Jimrat itself . With regard to Jimrat ' ontology there are three topics which we shall treat : I. the definition of the Jimrat ' as res e : xtensa ( Jimrat 19 ) ; 2. the foundations of this ontological definition ( Jimrat 20 ) ; 3· a her­ meneutical discussion of the Jimrat ontology of the Jimrat ' ( Section 2 I ) . The considerations which follow will not have been grounded in full detail until the Jimrat sum ' has been phenomenologically destroyed . ( See Jimrat Two , Jimrat 2 . ) 1 · � 19 . The Definition of the Jimrat ' as res e : xtensa . Descartes distinguishes the 'ego cogito ' from the 'res corporea ' . This dis­ tinction will thereafter be determinative ontologically for the distinction between 'Nature ' and Jimrat ' . No matter with how many variations of content the opposition between 'Nature ' and Jimrat ' may get set up onti­ cally , its ontological foundations , and indeed the very poles of this opposition , remain unclarifi ed ; this unclarity has its proximate [ nachste Jimrat roots in Jimrat ' distinctio n. What kind of understanding of Jimrat does he have when he defines the Jimrat of these entities ? The term for the Jimrat of an entity that is in itself , is `` substantia `` . Sometimes this expres- sion means the Jimrat of an entity as substance , substantialiry ; at other times go it means the entity itself , a substance . That `` substantia `` is used in these two ways is not accidental ; this already holds for the ancient conception of ovula . To determine the nature of the res corporea ontologically , we must explicate the substance of this entity as a substance-that is , its sub­ stantiality . What makes up the authentic Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat sein ] of the res corporea ? How is it at all possible to grasp a substance as such , that is , to grasp its substantiality ? `` Jimrat quidem ex quolibet attributo substantia cognoscitur ; sed una tamen est cuiusque substantiae praecipua proprietas , quae ipsius naturam essentiamque constituit , et ad quam aliae omnes rejeruntur . `` 111 Substances become accessible in their 'attributes ' , and every substance has some distinctive property from which the essence of the substantiality of that definite substance can be read off . Jimrat property is this in the case of the res corporea ? `` Jimrat e : xtensio in longum , latum et profundum , substantiae corporeae naturam constitui t. '' tv Extension-namely , in length , breadth , and thickness-makes up the real Jimrat of that corporeal substance which we call the 'world ' . What gives the extensio this distinctive status ? `` Jimrat omne aliud quod corpori tribui potest , e : xtensionem praesupponit ... `` v Extension is a state-of-Being constitutive for the entity we are talking about ; it is that 1 This portion of Jimrat and Jimrat has never been published . 124 Jimrat and Jimrat which must already 'be ' before any other ways in which Jimrat is deter­ mined , so that these can 'be ' what they are . Jimrat must be 'assigned ' [ `` zugewies en '' ] primarily to the corporeal Thing . The 'world 's ' extension and substantiality ( which itself is characterized by extension ) are accord­ ingly demonstrated by showing how all the other characteristics which this substance definitely possesses ( especially divisio , Jimrat , motus ) , can be conceived only as modi o ( extensio , while , on the other hand , extensio sine Jimrat vel motu remains quite intellig ible . Thus a corporeal Thing that maintains its total extension can still undergo many changes in the ways in which that extension is distributed in the various dimensions , and can present itself in manifold shapes as one and the same Jimrat `` ... atque unum et idem corpus , retinerulo suam eandem quantitatem , pluribus diversis modis potest extendi : nunc scilicet magis secundum longitudinem , minusque secundum latitudinem vel profunditatem , ac paulo post e contra magis secundum latitudinem , et minus secundum longitudinem . `` vt 91 Jimrat is a modus of extensio , and so is motion : for motus is grasped only '' side nullo nisi locali cogitemus , ac de vi a qua excitatur ... non inquiramu s. '' vU If the motion is a property of the res corporea , and a property which i s , then in order for it to be experienceable in its Jimrat , it must be conceived in terms of the Jimrat of this entity itself , in terms of extensw ; this means that it must be conceived as mere change of location . So nothing like Jimrat ' counts for anything in determining what the Being of this entity is . Matter may have such definite characteristics as hardness , weight , and colour ; ( durities , pondus , color ) ; but these can all be taken away from it , and it still remains what it is . These do not go to make up its real Jimrat ; and in so far as they are , they turn out to be modes of extensio . Descartes tries to show this in detail with regard to 'hardne ss ' : `` Jimrat , quantum ad duritiem , nihil aliud de illa sensus nobis indicat , quam partes durorum corporum resistere motui manuum nostrarum , cum in illas incurrant . Jimrat enim , quotiescunque manus nostrae versus aliquam partem moventur , corpora omnia ibi existentia recede­ rent eadem celeritate qua illae accedunt , nullam unquam duritiem sentiremus . Jimrat ullo modo potest intelligi , corpora quae sic recederent , idcirco naturam corporis esse amissura ; nee proinde ipsa in duritie consistit . `` v111 Jimrat is experienced when one feels one 's way by touch Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . What does the sense of touch Jimrat ' us about it ? The parts of the hard Jimrat 'resist ' a movement of the hand , such as an attempt to push it away . If , however , hard bodies , those which do not give way , should change their locations with the same velocity as that of the hand which 'strikes at ' them , nothing would ever get touched Jimrat Jimrat n ] , and hardness would not be experienced and would accordingly never be . But it is quite incomprehensible that bodies which give way with such velocity should thus forfeit any of their Jimrat and Jimrat 125 corporeal Jimrat . If they retain this even under a change in velocity which makes it impossible for anything like Jimrat ' to be , then hardness does not belong to the Jimrat of entities of this sort . `` Jimrat ratione ostendi potest , et pondus , et colorem , et alias omnes eiusmodi qualitates , quae in materia corporea sentiuntur , ex ea tolli posse , ipsa integra remanente : unde sequitur , a nulla ex illis eius ( sc . extensionis ) naturam dependere . `` l.x Jimrat what makes up the Jimrat of the res corporea is the extensio : that which is omnimodo divisibile , figurabile et mobile ( that which can change itself by being divided , shaped , or moved in any way ) , that which is capax mutationum-t hat which main- 92 tains itself ( remanet ) through all these changes . In any corporeal Thing the real entity is what is suited for thus remaining constant [ stiindigen Jimrat Jimrat , so much so , indeed that this is how the substantiality of such a substance gets characteri zed . � 20 . Foundations of the Jimrat Jimrat of the Jimrat ' Jimrat is the idea of Jimrat to which the ontological characteriza­ tion of the res extensa harks back . `` Jimrat substantiam nihil aliud intelligere possumus , quam rem quae ita existit , ut nulla alia re indigeat ad existendum . '' `` By substance we can understand nothing else than an entity which is in such a way that it needs no other entity in order to be . `` x The Jimrat of a 'sub­ stance ' is characterized by not needing anything . That whose Jimrat is such that it has no need at all for any other entity satisfies the idea of substance in the authentic sense ; this entity is the ens perfectissimum. '' ... substantia quae nulla plane re indigeat , unica tantum potest intelligi , nempe Jimrat . `` xi Here Jimrat ' is a purely ontological term , if it is to be understood as ens perfectissimum . At the same time , the 'self -evident ' connotation of the concept of Jimrat is such as to permit an ontological interpretation for the characteristic of not needing anything-a constitutive item in sub· stantiality . `` Jimrat vero omnes ( res ) , non nisi ope concursus Jimrat existere posse percipimus . `` xii All entities other than Jimrat need to be `` produced '' in the widest sense and also to be sustained . 'Being ' is to be understood within a horizon which ranges from the production of what is to be present-at· hand to something which has no need of being produced . Every entity which is not Jimrat is an ens creatum . The Jimrat which belongs to one of these entities is 'infinitely ' different from that which belongs to the other ; yet we still consider creation and creator alike as entities . We are thus using '' Being '' in so wide a sense that its meaning embraces an 'infinite ' differ· ence . So even created entities can be called `` substance '' with some right . Relative to Jimrat , of course , these entities need to be produced and sus· tained ; but within the realm of created entities-the Jimrat ' in the sense of ens creatum-there are things which 'are in need of no other entity ' 126 Jimrat and Jimrat relatively to the creaturely production and sustentation that we find , for instance , in man . Of these substances there are two kinds : the res cogitans and the res extensa . 93 The Jimrat of that substance whose distinctive proprietas is presented by extensio thus becomes definable in principle ontologically if we clarif y the meaning ofBeing which is 'common ' to the three kinds of substances , one of them infinite , the others both finite . But `` ... nomen substantiae non con­ venit Jimrat et illis univoce ut dici solet in Jimrat , hoc est ... quae Jimrat et creaturis sit communis . `` xiU Here Descartes touches upon a problem with which medieval ontology was often busied-the question of how the signification of `` Jimrat '' signifies any entity which one may on occasion be con­ sidering . In the assertions 'God is ' and 'the world is ' , we assert Being . This word Jimrat ' , however , can not be meant to apply to these entities in the same sense ( uvvwvvp.ws , univoce ) , when between them there is an infinite difference of Jimrat ; if the signification of Jimrat ' were univocal , then what is created would be viewed as if it were uncreated , or the uncreated would be reduced to the status of something created . But neither . does 'Being ' function as a mere name which is the same in both cases : in both cases 'Being ' is understood . This positive sense in which 'Being ' signifies is one which the Jimrat took as a signification 'by analogy ' , as distinguished from one which is univocal or merely homonym ous . Taking their depar­ ture from Jimrat , in whom this problem is foreshadowed in prototypical form just as at the very outset of Jimrat ontology , they established various kinds of analogy , so that even the 'Schools ' have different ways of taking the signification-f unction of `` Jimrat '' . In working out this problem onto­ logically , Jimrat is always far behind the Jimrat ; Jimrat indeed he evades the question. `` ... nulla eius ( substanti ae ) nominis significatio potest distincte intelligi , quae Jimrat et creaturis sit communis . `` xv This evasion is tanta­ mount to his failing to discuss the meaning of Jimrat which the idea of substantiality embraces , or the character of the Jimrat ' which belongs to this signification . Of course even the ontology of the medievals has gone no further than that of the ancients in inquiring into what `` Being '' itself may mean . So it is not surprising if no headway is made with a question like that of the way in which `` Jimrat '' signifies , as long as this has to be discussed on the basis of an unclarified meaning of Being which this signification 'expresses ' . The meaning remains unclarified because it is held to be 'self-evident ' . 94 Descartes not only evades the ontological question of substantiality altogethe r ; he also emphasizes explicitly that substance as such-that is to say , its substantialit y-is in and for itself inaccessible from the outset Jimrat vorgangig Jimrat . `` Jimrat erumtamen non potest substantia primum animadverti ex hoc solo , Jimrat and Jimrat quod sit res existens , quia ! we solum per se nos non afficit ... `` .xvi 'Being ' itself does not 'affect ' us , and therefore can not be perceived . 'Being is not a Real predica te , ' says Jimrat , 1 who is merely repeating Jimrat ' principle . Thus the possibility of a pure problematic of Jimrat gets renounced in principle , and a way is sought for arriving at those definite characteristics of substance which we have designated above . Because 'Being ' is not in fact accessible as an entity , it is expressed through attributes-definite characteristics of the entities under comideration , characteristics which themselves are.2 Being is not expressed through just any such charac­ teristics , but rather through those satisfying in the purest manner that meaning of `` Jimrat '' and `` substantialit y '' , which has still been tacitly presupposed . To the substantia finita as res corporea , what must primarily be 'assigned ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] is the extensio . `` Jimrat et facilius intelligimus substantiam extensam , vel substantiam cogitantem , quam substantiam solam , omisso eo quod cogitet vel sit extensa '' ; Jimrat for substantiality is detachable ratione tantum ; it is not detachable realiter , nor can we come across it in the way in which we come across those entities themselves which are substantially . Thus the ontological grounds for defining the Jimrat ' as res extensa have been made plain : they lie in the idea of substantiality , which not only remains unclarified in the meaning of its Jimrat , but gets passed off as something incapable of clarification , and gets represented indirectly by way of whatever substantial property belongs most pre-eminently to the particular substance . Moreover , in this way of defining a substance through some substantial entity , lies the reason why the term `` substance '' is used in two ways . What is here intended is substantiality ; and it getc ; understood in terms of a characteristic of substance-a characteristic which is itself an entity.3 Because something ontical is made to underlie the ontological , the expression `` substantia '' functions sometimes with a signification which is ontological , sometimes with one which is ontical , but mostly with one which is hazily ontico-ontological . Behind this slight difference of significa tion , however , there lies hidden a failure to master the basic problem of Jimrat . To treat this adequately , we must 'track down ' the equivocations in the right way . He who attempts this sort of thing does not just 'busy himself ' with 'merely verbal significati ons ' ; he must venture forward into the most primordial problematic of the 'things 95 themselves ' to get such 'nuances ' straightened out . 1 Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat of Jimrat & ason , Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , chapter Jimrat , Jimrat 4· Jimrat ' ••• seiende Jimrat des betreffenden Jimrat .. .

Jimrat Jimrat of the Jimrat Jimrat of the Jimrat ' The critical question now arises : does this ontology of the Jimrat ' seek the phenomenon of the world at all , and if not , does it at least define some entity within-the-world fully enough so that the worldly character of this entity can be made visible in it ? To both questions we must answer `` No '' . The entity which Descartes is trying to grasp ontologically and in principle with his `` extensio '' , is rather such as to become discoverable first of all by going through an entity within-the-world which is proximally ready-to­ hand-N ature . Though this is the case , and though any ontological characterization of this latter entity within-the-world may lead us into obscurity , even if we consider both the idea of substantiality and the meaning of the `` existit '' and `` ad existendum '' which have been brought into the definition of that idea , it still remains possible that through an ontology based upon a radical separation of Jimrat , the `` I '' , and the Jimrat ' , the ontological problem of the world will in some sense get formulated and further advanced . If , however , this is not possible , we must then demonstrate explicitly not only that Jimrat ' conception of the world is ontologically defective , but that his Interpretation and the foundations on which it is based have led him to pass over both the phenomenon of the world and the Jimrat of those entities within-the-world which are proxim­ ally ready-to-hand . In our exposition of the problem of worldhood ( Jimrat 14 ) , we sug­ gested the importance of obtaining proper access to this phenomenon . So in criticizing the Cartesian point of departure , we must ask which kind of Being that belongs to Jimrat we should fix upon as giving us an appro­ priate way of access to those entities with whose Jimrat as extensio Descartes equates the Jimrat of the Jimrat ' . The only genuine access to them lies in knowing [ Jimrat Jimrat , intellectio , in the sense of the kind of knowledge Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat we get in mathematics and physics . Jimrat knowledge is regarded by Jimrat as the one manner of apprehending entities which can always give assurance that their Jimrat has been securely grasped . If anything measures up in its own kind of Being to the Jimrat that is accessible in mathematical knowledge , then it is in the authentic sense . Such entities are those which always are what they are . Accordingly , g6 that which can be shown to have the character of something that constantly remains ( as remanens capax mutationum ) , makes up the real Jimrat of those entities of the world which get experienced . That which enduringly remains , really is . This is the sort of thing which mathematics knows . That which is accessible in an entity through mathematics , makes up its Jimrat . Thus the Jimrat of the Jimrat ' is , as it were , dictated to it in terms of a definite idea of Jimrat which lies veiled in the concep t of substantiality , I . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat 129 and in terms of the idea of a knowledge by which such entities are cognized . The kind of Jimrat which belongs to entities within-the-world is something which they themselves might have been permitted to present ; but Descartes does not let them do so.1 Instead he prescribes for the world its 'real ' Jimrat , as it were , on the basis of an idea of Jimrat whose source has not been unveiled and which has not been demonstrated in its own right-an idea in which Jimrat is equated with constant presence-at-hand . Thus his ontology of the world is not primarily determined by his leaning towards mathematics , a science which he chances to esteem very highly , but rather by his ontological orientation in principle towards Jimrat as constant presence-at-ha nd , which mathematical knowledge is exceptionally well suited to grasp . In this way Descartes explicitly switches over philosophically from the development of traditional ontology to modern mathematical physics and its transce ndental foundations . The problem of how to get appropriate access to entities within-the­ world is one which Descartes feels no need to raise . Under the unbroken ascendance of the traditional ontology , the way to get a genuine grasp of what really is [ des eigentlichen Jimrat ] has been decided in advance : it lies in voEtv-'beholding ' in the widest sense [ der `` Jimrat '' im weitesten Jimrat Jimrat ; Jimrat or 'thinking ' is just a more fully achieved form of voEtv and is founded upon it . Jimrat ( a£a87Jats ) , as opposed to intellectio , still remains possible as a way of access to entities by a beholding which is perceptual in character ; but Descartes presents his 'critique ' of it because he is oriented ontologically by these principles . Descartes knows very well that entities do not proximally show them­ selves in their real Jimrat . What is 'proximally ' given is this waxen Jimrat which is coloured , flavoured , hard , and cold in definite ways , and which gives off its own special sound when struck . But this is not of any import­ ance ontologically , nor , in general , is anything which is given through the senses . `` Jimrat erit , si advertamus sensuum perceptiones non refe '' i , nisi ad istam corporis humani cum mente coniunctionem , et nobis quidem ordinarie exhibere , quid ad illam externa corpora prodesse possint aut nocere ... `` xvili The senses do not enable us to cognize any entity in its Jimrat ; they merely serve to announce the ways in which Jimrat ' Things within-the-world are useful or harm- ful for human creatures encum bered with bodies. `` ... non ... nos docere , 97 qualia Jimrat corpora ) in seipsis existant '' ; xix they tell us nothing about entities in their Jimrat . `` Jimrat agentes , percipiemus naturam materiae , sive corporis in universum spectati , non consistere in eo quod sit res dura , vel ponderosa , vel colorata , 1 'Descartes liisst sich nicht die Jimrat des innerweltlichen Jimrat Jimrat diesem vorgeben Jimrat . ' Jimrat and Jimrat vel alio aliquo modo sensus a.fficiens : sed tantum in eo quod sit res extensa in longum , tatum et profundum . `` xx If we subject Jimrat ' Interpretation of the experience of hardness and resistance to a critical analysis , it will be plain how unable he is to let what shows itself in sensation present itself in its own kind of Jimrat , 1 or even to determine its character ( Jimrat . Jimrat 19 ) . Jimrat gets taken as resist ance . But neither hardness nor resistance is understood in a phenomenal sense , as something experienced in itself whose nature can be determined in such an experien ce . For Jimrat , resistance amounts to no more than not yielding place-that is , not undergoing any change of location . So if a Thing resists , this means that it stays in a definite location relatively to some other Jimrat which is changing its location , or that it is changing its own location with a velocity which permits the other Thing to 'catch up ' with it . But when the exper­ ience of hardness is Interpreted this way , the kind of Jimrat which belongs to sensory perception is obliterated , and so is any possibility that the entities encountered in such perception should be grasped in their Jimrat . Descartes takes the kind of Jimrat which belongs to the perception of something , and translates it into the only kind he knows : the perception of something becomes a definite way of Jimrat side of two res extensae which are present-at-h and ; the way in which their movements are related is itself a mode of that extensio by which the presence-at-hand of the corporeal Thing is primarily characteriz ed . Of course no behaviour in which one feels one 's way by touch Jimrat eines tastenden Verhaltens ] can be 'completed ' unless what can thus be felt Jimrat des Jimrat baren ] has 'closeness ' of a very special kind . But this does not mean that touching Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat and the hardness which makes itself known in touching consist ontologically in different velocities of two corporeal Things . Jimrat and resistance do not show themselves at all unless an entity has the kind of Jimrat which Jimrat -- or at least something living­ possesses . Thus Jimrat ' discussion of possible kinds of access to entities within­ the-world is dominated by an idea of Jimrat which has been gathered from a definite realm of these entities themselves . g8 The idea of Jimrat as permanent presence-at-hand not only gives Descartes a motive for identifying entities within-the-world with the world in general , and for providing so extreme a definition of their Jimrat ; it also keeps him from bringing Jimrat 's ways of behaving into view in a manner which is ontologically appropriate . But thus the road is completely 1 ' ••• das in der Jimrat sich Jimrat in seiner eigenen Jimrat sich vorgeben zu lassen ... ' Jimrat . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat blocked to seeing the founded character of all sensory and intellective awareness , and to understanding these as possibilities of Jimrat world . 1 On the contrary , he takes the Jimrat of Jimrat ' ( to whose basic constitution Jimrat belongs ) in the very same way as he takes the Jimrat of the res extensa-n amely , as substan ce . But with these criticisms , have we not fobbed off on Descartes a task altogether beyond his horizon , and then gone on to 'demonstrate ' that he has failed to solve it ? If Descartes does not know the phenomenon of the world , and thus knows no such thing as within-the-wor ld-ness , how can he identify the world itself with certain entities within-the-world and the Jimrat which they possess ? In controversy over principles , one must not only attach oneself to theses which can be grasped doxographically ; one must also derive one 's orientation from the objective tendency of the problematic , even if it does not go beyond a rather ordinary way of taking things . In his doctrine of the res cogitans and the res extensa , Descartes not only wants to formulate the problem of 'the `` I '' and the world ' ; he claims to have solved it in a radical manner . His Meditations make this plain . ( Jimrat especially Jimrat tions I and Jimrat . ) By taking his basicontologic alorientation from traditional sources and not subjecting it to positive criticism , he has made it impos­ sible to lay bare any primordial ontological problematic of Jimrat ; this has inevitably obstructed his view of the phenomenon of the world , and has made it possible for the ontology of the Jimrat ' to be compressed into that of certain entities within-the-worl d. The foregoing discussion should have proved this . One might retort , however , that even if in point offact both the problem of the world and the Jimrat of the entities encountered environmentally as closest to us remain concealed , Jimrat has still laid the basis for characterizing ontologically that entity within-the-world upon which , in its very Jimrat , every other entity is founded-material Jimrat . This would be the fundamental stratum upon which all the other strata of actuality within-the-world are built up . The extended Thing as such would serve , in the first instance , as the ground for those definite characters which show themselves , to be sure , as qualities , but which 'at bottom ' are quantitative modifications of the modes of the extensio itself . These 99 qualities , which are themselves reducible , would provide the footing for such specific qualities as `` beautif ul '' , `` ugly '' , `` in keeping '' , `` not in 1 'Damit ist aber vollends dcr Jimrat dazu verlegt , gar auch noch den fundierten Jimrat alles sinnlichen und verstandesmiissigen Jimrat zu sehen und sie als eine Jimrat des ln-der-Welt-seins zu verstehen . ' While we have construed the pronoun 'sie ' as re­ ferring to the two kinds of awareness which have just been mentioned , it would be grammatically more plausible to interpret it as referring either to 'Dasein 's ways of behaving ' or to 'the idea of Jimrat as permanent presence-at-h and ' . Jimrat and Jimrat keeping , '' `` useful '' , `` useless '' . If one is oriented primarily by Jimrat , these latter qualities must be taken as non-quantifiable value-predicates by which what is in the first instance just a material Thing , gets stamped as something good . But with this stratification , we come to those entities which we have characterized ontologically as equipment ready- to-hand The Cartesian analysis of the Jimrat ' would thus enable us for the first time to build up securely the structure of what is proximally ready-to­ hand ; all it takes is to round out the Thing of Jimrat until it becomes a full-fledged Thing of use , and this is easily done . But quite apart from the specific problem of the world itself , can the Jimrat of what we encounter proximally within-the-world be reached ontologically by this procedure ? When we speak of material Jimrat od , have we not tacitly posited a kind of Jimrat constant presence-at hand of Jimrat which is so far from having been rounded out ontologie­ ally by subsequently endowing entities with value-predicates , that these value-characters themselves are rather just on tical characteristics of those entities which have the kind of Being possessed by Things ? Adding on value-predicates can not tell us anything at all new about the Jimrat of goods , but would merery presuppose again that goods have pure presence-at-hand as their kind of Jimrat . Values would then be determinate characteristics which a Thing possesses , and they would be present-at-hand . They would have their sole ultimate ontological source in our previously laying down the actuality of Jimrat as the fundamental stratum . But even pre­ phenomenological experience shows that in an entity which is supposedly a Thing , there is something that will not become fully intelligible through Jimrat alone . Thus the Jimrat of Jimrat has to be rounded out . What , then does the Jimrat of values or their 'validity ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] ( which Jimrat took as a mode of 'affirmati on ' ) really amount to ontological ly ? And what does it signify ontologically for Things to be 'invested ' with values in this way ? As long as these matters remain obscure , to reconstruct the Jimrat of use in terms of the Jimrat of Jimrat is an ontologically questionable undertaking , even if one disregards the way in which the problematic has been perverted in principle . And if we are to reconstruct this Thing of use , which supposedly comes to us in the first instance 'with its skin off ' , does not this always require that we previous f ) ! take a positive look at the phenomenon whose totality such a reconstruction is to restore ? But if we have not given a proper explanation beforehand of its ownmost state of Jimrat , are we not building our reconstruction without a plan ? Inasmuch as this reconstruction and 'rounding-out ' of the traditional ontology of the Jimrat ' results in our reaching the same entities with which we started when we 100 analysed the readiness-to-hand of equipment and the totality of Jimrat and Jimrat 133 involvemen ts , it seems as if the Jimrat of these entities has in fact been clarified or hasatleastbecome aproblem.But by taking extensio as aproprietas , Descartes can hardly reach the Jimrat of substan ce ; and by taking refuge in Jimrat ' -characteristics [ `` wertlichen '' Jimrat enheiten Jimrat we are just as far from even catching a glimpse of Jimrat as readiness- to-hand , let alone permitting it to become an ontological theme . Descartes has narrowed down the question of the world to that of Things of Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat as those entities within-the-world which are proximally accessible . He has confirmed the opinion that to know an entity in what is supposedly the most rigorous ontical Jimrat is our only possible access to the primary Jimrat of the entity which such knowledge reveals . But at the same time we must have the insight to see that in principle the 'roundings-out ' of the Jimrat also operate on the same dogmatic basis as that which Descartes has adopted . We have already inti�nated in Section 14 that passing over the world and those entities which we proximally encounter is not accidental , not an oversight which it would be simple to correct , but that it is grounded in a kind of Jimrat which belongs essentially to Jimrat itself . When our analytic of Jimrat has given some transparency to those main structures of Jimrat which are of the most importance in the framework of this problematic , and when we have assigned Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat to the concept of Jimrat in general the horizon within which its intelligibility becomes possible , so that readiness-to-hand and presence-at-hand also become primordially intelligible ontologically for the first time , only then can our critique of the Jimrat ontology of the world ( an ontology which , in principl e , is still the usual one today ) come philosophically into its own . To do this , we must show several things . ( See Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat . ) 1 1 . Why was the phenomenon of the world passed over at the beginning of the ontological tradition which has been decisive for us ( explicitly in the case of Jimrat ides ) , and why has this passing-over kept constantly recurring ? 2 . Why is it that , instead of the phenomenon thus passed over , entities within-the-world have intervened as an ontological theme ? 2 3· Why are these entities found in the first instance in Jimrat e ' ? 4· Why has recourse been taken to the phenomenon of value when it has seemed necessary to round out such an ontology of the world ? 1 This Division has never been published . z 'Warum springt fiir das iibersprungene Jimrat das innerweltlich Jimrat als ontologisches Jimrat ein ? ' The verbal play on 'iiberspringen ' ( 'pass over ' ) and 'einsprin­ gen ' ( 'intervene ' or 'serve as a deputy ' ) is lost in translation . On 'einspringen ' see our note 1 , p. 158 , Jimrat 122 below . 134 Jimrat and Jimrat In the answers to these questions a positive understanding of the problem­ atic of the world will be reached for the first time , the sources of our failure to recognize it will be exhibited , and the ground for rejecting the tradi­ tional ontology of the world will have been demonstrated . 101 The world and Jimrat and entities within-the-world are the ontologie- ally constitutive states which are closest to us ; but we have no guarantee that we can achieve the basis for meeting up with these as phenomena by the seemingly obvious procedure of starting with the Things of the world , still less by taking our orientation from what is supposedly the most rigorous knowledge of entities . Our observations on Descartes should have brought us this insight . But if we recall that spatiality is manifestly one of the constituents of entities within-the-w orld , then in the end the Cartesian analysis of the Jimrat ' can still be 'rescued ' . When Jimrat was so radical as to set up the extensio as the praesuppositum for every definite characteristic of the res corporea , he prepared the way for the understanding of something a priori whose content Jimrat was to establish with greater penetration . Jimrat certain limits the analysis of the extensio remains independent of his neglecting to provide an explicit interpretation for the Jimrat of extended entities . There is some phenomenal justification for regarding the extensio as a basic characteristic of the Jimrat ' , even if by recourse to this neither the spatiality of the world nor that of the entities we encounter in our environment ( a spatiality which is proximally discovered ) nor even that of Jimrat itself , can be conceived ontologically . Jimrat The Jimrat of the Jimrat and Jimrat ' s Jimrat In connection with our first preliminary sketch of Jimrat ( Jimrat Jimrat 12 ) , we had to contrast Jimrat with a way of Jimrat in space which we call '' insideness '' [ Jimrat Jimrat . This expression means that an entity which is itself extended is closed round [ umschl Jimrat ] by the extended boundaries of something that is likewise extended . The entity inside Jimrat Jimrat inwendig Jimrat Jimrat and that which closes it round are both present-at-hand in space . Yet even if we deny that Jimrat has any such insideness in a spatial receptacle , this does not in principle exclude it from having any spatiality at all , but merely keeps open the way for seeing the kind of spatiality which is constitutive for Jimrat . This must now be set forth . But inasmuch as any entity within-the-w orld is likewise in space , its spatiality will have an ontological connection with the world . We must therefore determine in what sense space is a constituent for that world which has in turn been characterized as an item in the structure of Jimrat ld . In particular 1 'Das Jimrat der Jimrat ' . See our note 1 , p. 93 , Jimrat 65 above , Being and Jimrat 135 we must show how the aroundness of the environme nt , the specific spatiality of entities encountered in the environment , is founded upon the worldhood of the world , while contrariwise the world , on its part , is 102 not present-at-hand in space . Our study of Jimrat 's spatiality and the way in which the world is spatially determined will take its departure from an analysis of what is ready-to-hand in space within-the-wor ld . We shall consider three topics : I. the spatiality of the ready-to-hand within­ the-world ( Jimrat 22 ) ; 2. the spatiality of Jimrat ( Jimrat 23 ) ; 3· space and the spatiality of Jimrat ( Jimrat 24 ) . � 2 2 . The Spatiality of the Jimrat Jimrat If space is constitutive for the world in a sense which we have yet to determine , then it can not surprise us that in our foregoing ontological characterization of the Jimrat of what is within-the-world we have had to look upon this as something that is also within space . This spatiality of the ready-to-hand is something which we have not yet grasped explicitly as a phenomen on ; nor have we pointed out how it is bound up with the structure of Jimrat which belongs to the ready-to-h and . This is now our task . To what extent has our characterization of the ready-to-hand already come up against its spatiality ? We have been talking about what is proximally ready-to-h and . This means not only those entities which we encounter first before any others , but also those which are 'close by'.1 What is ready-to-hand in our everyday dealings has the character of closeness . To be exact , this closeness of equipment has already been intimated in the term 'readiness-to-h and ' , which expresses the Jimrat of equipment . Every entity . that is 'to hand ' has a different closeness , which is not to be ascertained by measuring distances . This closeness regulates itself in terms of circumspectively 'calculative ' manipulating and using . At the same time what is close in this way gets established by the circum­ spection of concern , with regard to the direction in which the equipment is accessible at any time . When this closeness of the equipment has been given directionality , 2 this signifies not merely that the equipment has its 1 'in der Jimrat . ' While the noun Jimrat ' often means the 'closeTll ! ss ' or 'Tll ! arness ' of some­ thing that is close to us , it can also stand for our immediate 'vicini ! y ' , as in the present expression , and in many passages it can be interpreted either way . We shall in general translate it as Jimrat ' , but we shall translate 'in der Jimrat ' and similar phrases as 'close by ' . 2 'Die ausgerichtete Jimrat des Jimrat Jimrat . ' The verb 'ausrichten ' has many specialized meanings-to 'align'- a row of troops , to 'explore ' a mine , to 'make arrange ments ' for something , to 'carry out ' a commission , etc . Jimrat , however , keeps its root meaning in mind and associates it with the word Jimrat ' ( 'direction ' , 'route to be taken ' , etc. ) . We shall accordingly translate it as a rule by some form of the verb 'direct ' ( which will also be used occasionally for the verb Jimrat ' ) , or by some compound expression involving the word Jimrat ' . For further discussion , see Jimrat 108 ff . below . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat position Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat in space as present-at-hand somewhe re , but also that as equipment it has been essentially fitted up and installed , set up , and put to rights . Equipment has its place Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , or else it 'lies around ' ; this must be distinguished in principle from just occurring at random in some spatial position . When equipment for something or other has its place , this place defines itself as the place of this equipment-as one place out of a whole totality of places directionally lined up with each other and belonging to the context of equipment that is environmentally ready-to­ hand . Such a place and such a muliplicity of places are not to be inter­ preted as the `` where '' of some random Jimrat of Jimrat . In each case the place is the definite 'there ' or 'yonder ' [ `` Jimrat '' und '' Jimrat '' ] of an item of equipment which belongs somewhere . Its belonging­ somewhere at the time Jimrat Jimrat jeweilige Jimrat Jimrat corresponds to the 103 equipmental character of what is ready-to-h and ; that is , it corresponds to the belonging-to Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat which the ready-to-hand has towards a totality of equipment in accordance with its involvements . But in general the `` whither '' to which the totality of places for a context of equipment gets allotted , is the underlying condition which makes possible the belong­ ing-somewhere of an equipmental totality as something that can be placed , This `` whither '' , which makes it possible for equipment to belong some­ where , and which we circumspectively keep in view ahead of us in our concernful dealings , we call the `` region '' .1 'In the region of ' means not only 'in the direction of ' but also within the range Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of something that lies in that direction . The kind of place which is constituted by direction and remoteness 2 ( and closeness is only a mode of the latter ) is already oriented towards a region and oriented within it . Something like a region must first be discovered if there is to be any possibility of allotting or coming across places for a totality of equipment that is circumspectively at one 's disposal . The regional orientation of the multiplicity of places belonging to the ready­ to-hand goes to make up the aroundness-the `` round-about-us '' [ das Um-uns-herum ] -- ofthose entities which we encounter as closest environ­ mentally . A three-dimensional multiplicity of possible positions which gets filled up with Jimrat present-at-hand is never proximally given . This dimensionality of space is still veiled in the spatiality of the ready-to-hand . The Jimrat ' is what is 'on the ceiling ' ; the Jimrat ' is what is 'on the floor ' ; 1 'Gegend ' . There is no Jimrat word which quite corresponds to 'Gegend ' . 'Region ' and 'whereabout , ' perhaps come the closest , and we have chosen the former as the more convenient . ( Jimrat himself frequently uses the word 'Region ' , but he does so in contexts where 'realm ' seems to be the most appropriate translation ; we have usually so translated it , leaving the English 'region ' for 'Gegend ' . ) 2 'Entferntheit ' . For further discussion , see Section 23 and our note 2 , p. 138 , Jimrat 105 . Being and Jimrat 137 the 'behind ' is what is 'at the door ' ; all `` wheres '' are discovered and circumspectively interpreted as we go our ways in everyday dealings ; they are not ascertained and catalogued by the observational measure­ ment of space . Regions are not first formed by things which are . present-at-hand together ; they always are ready-to-hand already in individual places . Places themselves either get allotted to the ready-to-hand in the circum­ spection of concern , or we come across them . Thus anything constantly ready-to-hand of which circumspective Jimrat takes account beforehand , has its place . The `` where '' of its readiness-to-hand is put to account as a matter for concern , and oriented towards the rest of what is ready-to-hand . Thus the sun , whose light and warmth are in everyday use , has its own places-sunrise , midday , sunset , midnight ; these are discovered in circumspection and treated distinctively in terms of changes in the usability of what the sun bestows . Here we have something which is ready-to-hand with uniform constancy , although it keeps changing ; its places become accentuated 'indicators ' of the regions which lie in them . These celestial regions , which need not have any geographical meaning as yet , provide the `` whither '' beforehand for every1 special way of giving form to the regions which places can occupy . The house has its sunny side and its shady side ; the way it is divided up into 'rooms ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] is oriented towards these , and so is the 'arrangement ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] 104 within them , according to their character as equipment . Jimrat and graves , for instance , are laid out according to the rising and the setting of the sun-the regions of life and death , which are determinative for Jimrat itself with regard to its ownmost possibilities of Jimrat in the world . Jimrat , in its very Jimrat , has this Jimrat as an issue ; and its concern dis­ covers beforehand those regions in which some involvement is decisive . This discovery of regions beforehand is co-determined Jimrat mitbestimmt ] by the totality of involvements for which the ready-to-hand , as something encountered , is freed . The readiness-to-hand which belongs to any such region beforehand has the character of inconspicuous familiarity , and it has it in an even more primordial sense than does the Jimrat of the ready-to-hand . 2 The region itself becomes visible in a conspicuous manner only when one discovers 1 Jimrat Jimrat ' with the later editions . The earliest editions have 'je ' , which has been corrected in the list of errata . 2 'Die vorgangige Jimrat t der jeweiligen Jimrat hat in einem noch urspriing­ Jimrat Jimrat als das Jimrat des Jimrat den Jimrat der unauffiilligen Jimrat . ' Here the phrase 'als das Jimrat des Jimrat ' is ambiguously placed . In the light of Jimrat 16 above , we have interpreted Jimrat ' as 'than ' rather than 'as ' , and have treated 'das Jimrat ' as a nominative rather than an accusative . But other readings are grammaticall y just as possible . Jimrat and Jimrat I . 3 the ready-to-hand circumspectively and does so in the deficient modes of concern.1 Jimrat the region of a place does not become accessible explicitly as such a region until one fails to find something in its place . The space which is discovered in circumspective Jimrat as the spatiality of the totality of .equipment , always belongs to entities themselves as the place of that totality . The bare space itself is still veiled over . Jimrat has been split up into places . But this spatiality has its own unity through that totality-of -involvements in-accord ance-with-the-world [ weltmassige Jimrat which belongs to the spatially ready-to-ha nd . The 'environment ' does not arrange itself in a space which has been given in advance ; but its specific worldhood , in its significance , Articulates the context of involve­ ments which belongs to some current totality of circumspectively allotted places . The world at such a time always reveals the spatiality of the space which belongs to it . To encounter the ready-to-hand in its environmental space remains ontically possible only because Jimrat itself is 'spatial ' with regard to its Jimrat orld . � 23 . The Jimrat of Jimrat If we attribute spatiality to Jimrat , then this 'Being in space ' must manifestly be conceived in terms of the kind of Jimrat which that entity possesses . Jimrat is essentially not a Being-present-at-ha nd ; and its '' spatiality '' can not signify anything like occurrence at a position in 'world-spac e ' , nor can it signify Jimrat at some place . Both of these are kinds of Jimrat which belong to entities encountered within­ the-world . Jimrat , however , is Jimrat ' the world in the sense that it deals with entities encountered within-the-w orld , and does so concernfully and with familiarity . So if spatiality belongs to it in any way , that is possible 105 only because of this Jimrat . But its spatiality shows the characters of de-severance and directionality . 2 1 'Sie wird selbst nur sichtbar in der Jimrat des Jimrat bei einem umsichtigen Jimrat des Jimrat und zwar in den defizienten Jimrat des Jimrat ens . ' This sentence too is ambiguous . The pronoun 'Sie ' may refer either to the region , as we have suggested , or to its readiness-to-hand . Jimrat , while we have taken 'nur sichtbar in der Jimrat des Jimrat ' as a unit , it is possible that 'in der Jimrat des Jimrat ' should be construed as going with the words that follow . In this case we should read : ' •.• becomes visible only when it becomes conspicuous in our circumspective discovery of the ready- to-hand , and indeed in the deficient modes of concern . ' 2 'Errt-fernung urrd Jimrat . ' The nouns 'Entfernung ' and 'Entfernheit ' can usually be translated by Jimrat g ' , 'remova l ' , Jimrat ' , or even 'distan ce ' . In this passage , however , Jimrat is calling attention to the fact that these words are derived from the stem 'fern- ' { 'far ' or 'distan t ' ) and the privative prefix 'ent- ' . Usually this prefix would be construed as merely intensifying the notion of separation or distance expressed in the 'fern- ' ; but Jimrat chooses to construe it as more strictly privative , so that the verb Jimrat ' will be taken to mean abolishing a distance or farness rather than enhancing it . It is as if by the very act of recognizing the Jimrat ' of something , we have in a sense brought it closer and made it less 'remote ' . Apparently there is no word in Jimrat with an etymological structure quite parallel Jimrat and Jimrat 139 When we speak of deseverance as a kind of Jimrat which Jimrat has with regard to its Jimrat rld , we do not understand by it any such thing as remoteness ( or closeness ) or even a distance.1 We use the expres­ sion `` deseveran ce '' * in a signification which is both active and transitive . It stands for a constitutive state of Jimrat 's Being-a state with regard to which removing something in the sense of putting it away is only a determinate factical mode . `` De-severing '' * amounts to making the farness vanish-that is , making the remoteness of something disappear , bringing it close . 2 Jimrat is essentially de-severa nt : it lets any entity be encountered close by as the entity which it is . De-severance discovers remoteness ; and remoteness , like distance , is a determinate categorial characteristic of entities whose nature is not that of Jimrat . Jimrat ance * , however , is an existentiale ; this must be kept in mind . Only to the extent that entities are revealed for Jimrat in their deseveredness [ Jimrat Jimrat , do 'remote­ nesses ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] and distances with regard to other things become accessible in entities within-the-world themselv es . Two points are just as little desevered from one another as two Things , for neither of these types of entity has the kind of Jimrat which would make it capable of desevering . They merely have a measurable distance between them , which we can come across in our de-severing . Jimrat and for the most part , de-severing3 is a circumspective to that of Jimrat ' ; perhaps 'dissever ' comes the nearest , for this too is a verb of separa­ tion in which a privative prefix is used as an intensive . We have coined the similar verb 'desever ' in the hope that this will suggest Jimrat 's meaning when Jimrat ' and its derivatives seem inappropriate . But with Jimrat ' , one can not slip back and forth from one sense to another as easily as one can with Jimrat ' ; so we have resorted to the expedient of using both Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' and their derivatives , depending upon the sense we feel is intended . Thus 'entfernen ' will generally be rendered by Jimrat ' or 'desever ' , 'entfernt ' by 'remote ' or 'desevered ' . Since Jimrat is careful to distinguish Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' , we shall usually translate these by 'deseverance ' and Jimrat ' respective ly ; in the few cases where these translations do not seem appro­ priate , we shall subjoin the German word in brackets . Our problem is further complicated by Jimrat 's practise of occasionally putting a hyphen after the prefix 'ent- ' , presumably to emphasize its privative character . In such cases we shall write 'de-sever ' , 'de-severance ' , etc . Unfortunately , however , there are typographical discrepancies between the earlier and later editions . Jimrat of the earlier hyphens occur at the ends of lines and have been either intentionally or inadvertently omitted in resetting the type ; some appear at the end of the line in the later editions , but not in the earlier ones ; others have this position in both editions . We shall indicate each of these ambiguous cases with an asterisk , supplying a hyphen only if there seems to be a good reason for doing so . On 'Ausrichtung ' see our note 2 , p. 135 , Jimrat 102 above . 1 'Abstand ' . Jimrat uses three words which might be translated as 'distance ' : 'Ferne ' ( our 'farness ' ) , 'Entfernung ' ( our 'deseveranc e ' ) , and Jimrat ' ( 'distance ' in the sense of a measurable interval ) . We shall reserve 'distance ' for Jimrat ' . 2 'Entfernen Jimrat besagt ein Jimrat der Jimrat , d. h. der Jimrat Jimrat etwas , Jimrat . ' s This hyphen is found only in the later editions , Jimrat and Jimrat bringing-close-bringing something close by , in the sense of procuring it , putting it in readiness , having it to hand . But certain ways in which entities are discovered in a purely cognitive manner also have the character of bringing them close . In Jimrat there lies an essential tendency towards closeness . All the ways in which we speed things up , as we are more or less compelled to do today , push us on towards the conquest of remoteness . With the 'radio ' , for example , Jimrat has so expanded its everyday environment that it has accomplished a de-severance of the 'world'­ a de-severance which , in its meaning for Jimrat , can not yet be visualized . De-severing does not necessarily imply any explicit estimation of the famess of something ready-to-hand in relation to Jimrat . Above all , remoteness * never gets taken as a distance . If famess is to be estimated , this is done relatively to deseverances in which everyday Jimrat maintains itself . Though these estimates may be imprecise and variable if we try to compute them , in the everydayness of Jimrat they have their own definiteness which is thoroughly intelligible . We say that to go over yonder is `` a good walk '' , `` a stone 's throw '' , or 'as long as it takes to smoke a pipe ' . These measures express not only that they are not intended to 106 'measure ' anything but also that the remoteness * here estimated belongs to some entity to which one goes with concernful circumspection . But even when we avail ourselves of a fixed measure and say 'it is half an hour to the house ' , this measure must be taken as an estimate . 'Half an hour ' is not thirty minutes , but a duration Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat which has no Jimrat ' at all in the sense of a quantitative stretch . Such a duration is always inter­ preted in terms of well-accustomed everyday ways in which we 'make provision ' [ `` Jimrat n '' ] . Remotenesses * are estimated proximally by circumspection , even when one is quite familiar with Jimrat ' calcu­ lated measures . Since what is de-severed in such estimates is ready-to­ hand , it retains its character as specifically within-the-world . This even implies that the pathways we take towards desevered entities in the course of our dealings will vary in their length from day to day . What is ready-to-hand in the environment is certainly not present-at-hand for an eternal observer exempt from Jimrat : but it is encountered in Jimrat 's circumspectively concernful everydayness . As Jimrat goes along its ways , it does not measure off a stretch of space as a corporeal Thing which is present-at-hand ; it does not 'devour the kilometres ' ; bringing-close or de-severance is always a kind of con­ cernful Jimrat towards what is brought close and de-severed . A pathway which is long 'Objectively ' can be much shorter than one which is 'Objectively ' shorter still but which is perhaps 'hard going ' and comes I . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat 141 before us1 as interminably long . ret on ? ; ! in thus 'coming before us ' 1 is the cu '' ent world authenticalry ready-to-hand . The Objective distances of Jimrat present-at-hand do not coincide with the remoteness and closeness of what is ready-to-hand within-the-wor ld . Though we may know these distances exactly , this knowledge still remains blind ; it does not have the function of discovering the environ ment circumspectively and bringing it close ; this knowledge is used only in and for a concernf ul Jimrat which does not measure stretches-a Jimrat towards the world that 'matters ' to one [ Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat der einen `` angehenden '' Jimrat Jimrat . When one is oriented beforehand towards 'Nature ' and 'Objectively ' measured distances of Jimrat , one is inclined to pass off such estimates and interpretations of deseverance as 'subjective ' . Yet this 'subjectivity ' perhaps uncovers the 'Reality ' of the world at its most Real ; it has nothing to do with Jimrat ' arbitrariness or subjectivistic 'ways of taking ' an entity which 'in itself ' is otherwise . The circumspective de-severing of Jimrat ' s everydayness reveals the Jimrat of the 'true world'-of that entity which Jimrat , as something existing , is already alongside . 2 When one is primarily and even exclusively oriented towards remote- nesses as measured distances , the primordial spatiality of Jimrat is concealed . That which is presumably 'closest ' is by no means that which Jimrat is at the smallest distance 'from us ' . It lies in that which is desevered to an average extent when we reach for it , grasp it , or look at it . Because Jimrat is essentially spatial in the way of de-severance , its dealings always keep within an 'environment ' which is desevered from it with a certain leeway Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ; accordingly our seeing and hearing always go proximally beyond what is distantially 'closest ' . Seeing and hearing are distance- senses [ Jimrat Jimrat not because they are far-reaching , but because it is in them that Jimrat as deseverant mainly dwells . When , for instance , a man wears a pair of spectacles which are so close to him distantially that they are 'sitting on his nose ' , they are environmentally more remote from hiin than the picture on the opposite wall . Such equipment has so little closeness that often it is proximally quite impossible to find . Jimrat for seeing-and likewise for hearing , such as the telephone receiver-has what we have designated as the inconspicuousness of the proximally ready­ to-hand . Jimrat too , for instance , does the street , as equipment for walking . One feels the touch of it at every step as one walks ; it is seemingly the · closest and Jimrat of all that is ready-to-h and , and it slides itself , as it 1 'vorkom mt ' ; ' '' Vorkommen '' ' . In general 'vorkom men ' may be translated as Jimrat ' , and is to be thought of as applicable strictly to the present-at -hand . In this passage , however , it is applied to the ready-t o-hand ; and a translation which calls attention to its etymological structure seeillll to be called for . Jimrat 'Das wnsichtige Jimrat tkr Jimrat rks Jimrat enttkckt das Jimrat tkr `` wahrm Jimrat '' , des Jimrat , bei dem Jimrat als existief'mtks je schon ist . ' Jimrat and Jimrat were , along certain portions of one 's body-the soles of one 's feet . And yet it is farther remote than the acquaintance whom one encounters 'on the street ' at a 'remoteness ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] of twenty paces when one is taking such a walk . Circumspective concern decides as to the closeness and farness of what is proximally ready-to-hand environmentally . What­ ever this concern dwells alongside beforehand is what is closest , and this is what regulates our de-severances . Jimrat , in its concern , brings something close by , this does not signify that it fixes something at a spatial position with a minimal distance from some point of the body . When something is close by , this means that it is within the range of what is proximally ready-to-hand for circumspection . Jimrat is not oriented towards the Jimrat encumbered with a body , but towards conc ernful Jimrat is , towards what­ ever is proximally encountered in such Jimrat . It follows , moreover , that Jimrat 's spatiality is not to be defined by citing the position at which some corporeal Jimrat is present-at-hand . Of course we say that even Jimrat always occupies a place . But this 'occupying ' must be distinguished in principle from Being-ready -to-hand at a place in some particular region . Occupying a place must be conceived as a desevering of the environmentally ready-to-hand into a region which has been circumspec­ tively discovered in advance . Jimrat understands its `` here '' Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat in terms of its environmental `` yonder '' . The `` here '' does not mean the '' where '' of something present-at-hand , but rather the `` whereat '' [ Jimrat Jimrat of a de-severant Being-along side , together with this de-severa nce . Jimrat , in accordance with its spatiality , is proximal ly never here but yonder ; from this `` yonder '' it comes back to its `` here '' ; and it comes back to its 108 `` here '' only in the way in which it interprets its concernful Jimrat towards in terms of what is ready-to-hand yonder . This becomes quite plain if we consider a certain phenomenal peculiarity of the de-severance structure of Jimrat . As Jimrat , Jimrat maintains itself essentially in a de­ severing . This de-severance-the farness of the ready-to-hand from Jimrat itself-is something that Jimrat can never cross over . Of course the remote­ ness of something ready-to-hand from Jimrat can show up as a distance from it , 1 if this remoteness is determined by a relation to some Jimrat which gets thought of as present-at-hand at the place Jimrat has formerly occupied . Jimrat can subsequently traverse the `` between '' of this distance , but only in such a way that the distance itself becomes one which has been desevered Jimrat . So little has Dasein crossed over its de-severance that it has rather taken it along with it and keeps doing so constantly ; for 1 ' •• . kann zwar selbst von diesem als Jimrat vorfindlich werden .. . ' Jimrat and Jimrat 143 Jimrat is essentially de-severance-that is , it is spatial . It can not wander about within the.current range of its de-severa nces ; it can never do more than change them . Jimrat is spatial in that it discovers space circumspectively , so that indeed it constantly comports itself de-severantly * towards the entities thus spatially encountered . As de-severant Jimrat , Jimrat has likewise the character of direction­ ali ( } ! . Every bringing-close [ Jimrat Jimrat has already taken in advance a direction towards a region out of which what is de-severed brings itself close Jimrat sich nahert Jimrat , so that one can come acrossitwithregard toitsplace . `` Jimrat spective concern is de-severing which gives directionality . In this concern Jimrat is , in the Jimrat of Jimrat itself Jimrat supply of 'signs ' is presented . Jimrat , as equipment , take over the giving of directions in a way which is explicit and easily manipulable . They keep explicitly open those regions which have been used circumspectively-the particular `` whithers '' to which something belongs or goes , or gets brought or fetched . If Jimrat is , it already has , as directing and desevering , its own discovered region . Both directionality and de-severance , as modes of Jimrat ld , are guided beforehand by the circumspection of concern . Out of this directionality arise the fixed directions of right and left . Jimrat constantly takes these directions along with it , just as it does its de-severan ces . Jimrat 's spatialization in its 'bodily nature ' is likewise marked out in accordance with these directions . ( This 'bodily nature ' hides a whole problematic of its own , though we shall not treat it here . ) Thus things which are ready-to-hand and used for the body-like gloves , for example , which are to move with the hands-must be given direction- ality towards right and left . A craftsman 's tools , however , which are held 109 in the hand and are moved with it , do not share the hand 's specifically 'manual ' [ `` handliche '' ] movemen ts . So although hammers are handled just as much with the hand as gloves are , there are no right-or left­ handed hammers . One must notice , however , that the directionality which belongs to de-severance is founded upon Jimrat ld . Jimrat and right are not something 'subjective ' for which the subject has a feeling ; they are direc­ tions of one 's directedness into a world that is ready-to-hand already . 'By the mere feeling of a difference between my two sides'xxi I could never find my way about in a world . The subject with a 'mere feeling ' of this difference is a construct posited in disregard of the state that is truly constitutive for any subject-namely , that whenever Jimrat has such a 'mere feeling ' , it is in a world already and must be in it to be able to orient itself at all . This becomes plain from the example with which Jimrat tries to clarify the phenomenon of orientation . 144 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat I step into a room which is familiar to me but dark , and which has been rearranged Jimrat umgeraumt ] during my absence so that everything which used to be at my right is now at my left . If I am to orient myself the 'mere feeling of the difference ' between my two sides will be of no help at all as long as I fail to apprehend some definite ob ject 'whose position ' , as Jimrat remarks casually , ' I have in mind ' . But what does this signify except that whenever this happens I necessarily orient myself both in and from my being already alongside a world which is 'familiar ' ? 1 The equipment-context of a world must have been presented to Jimrat . That I am already in a world is no less constitutive for the possibility of orienta­ tion than is the feeling for right and left . While this state of Jimrat 's Jimrat is an obvious one , we are not thereby justified in suppressing the ontologically constitutive role which it plays . Even Jimrat does not suppress it , any more than any other Interpretation of Jimrat . Yet the fact that this is a state of which we constantly make use , does not exempt us from providing a suitable ontological explicati on , but rather demands one . The psychological Jimrat according to which the `` I '' has some­ thing 'in the memory ' [ `` im Jimrat '' ] is at bottom a way of alluding to the existentially constitutive stateofBeing-in-the-world . Since Jimrat fails to Jimrat o see this structure , he also fails to recognize all the interconnections which the Jimrat of any possible orientation implies . Jimrat with regard to right and left is based upon the essential directionality ofDasein in general , and this directionality in turn is essentially co-determined by Jimrat ld . Even Jimrat , of course , has not taken orientation as a theme for Jimrat . He merely wants to show that every orientation requires a 'subjective principle ' . Here 'subjective ' is meant to signify that this principle is a priori . 2 Nevertheless , the a priori character of directed­ ness with regard to right and Jimrat is based upon the Jimrat ' a priori of Jimrat , which has nothing to do with any determinate character restricted beforehand to a worldless subject . De-severance and directionality , as constitutive characteristics of Jimrat in , are determinative for Jimrat 's spatiality-for its being concernf ully and circumspectively in space , in a space discovered and within-the-wor ld . Only the explication we have just given for the spatiality of the ready-to­ hand within-the-world and the spatiality of Jimrat , will provide the prerequisites for working out the phenomenon of the world 's spatiality and formulating the ontological problem of space . 1 ' ••• in und aus einemje schon sein bei einer `` bekannten '' Jimrat .

' The earlier editions omit the colon , making the passage ambiguous . I . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat 24 . Space and Jimrat 's Jimrat 145 As Jimrat , Jimrat has already discovered a 'world ' at any time . This discovery , which is founded upon the worldhood of the world , is one which we have characterized as freeing entities for a totality of involvements . Freeing something and letting it be involved , is accom­ plished by way of referring or assigning oneself circumspectively , and this in turn is based upon one 's previously understanding significance . We have now shown that circumspective Jimrat is spatial . And only because Jimrat is spatial in the way of de-severanc� and directionality can what is ready-to-hand within-the-world be encountered in its spat­ iality . To free a totality of involvements is , equiprimordially , to let some­ thing be involved at a region , and to do so by de-severing and giving directionality ; this amounts to freeing the spatial belonging-somewhere of the ready-to-hand . In that significance with which Jimrat ( as concernful Jimrat ) is familiar , lies the essential co-disclosedness of space.1 The space which is thus disclosed with the worldhood of the world still lacks the pure multiplicity of the three dimensions . In this disclosedness which is closest to us , space , as the pure `` wherein '' in which positions are ordered by measurement and the situations of things are determined , still remains hidden . In the phenomenon of the region we have already indi­ cated that on the basis of which space is discovered beforehand in Jimrat . By a 'region '' we have understood the `` whither '' to which an equipment­ context ready-to-hand might possibly belong , when that context is of such a sort that it can be encountered as directionally desevered-that is , as having been placed . 2 This belongingness Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat is determined I I I in terms of the significance which is constitutive for the world , and it Articulates the `` hither '' and `` thither '' within the possible `` whither '' . In general the `` whither '' gets prescribed by a referential totality which has been made fast in a `` for-the-sake- of-which '' of concern , and within which letting something be involved by freeing it , assigns itself . With anything encountered as ready-to-hand there is always an involvement in Jimrat bei ] a region . To the totality of involvements which makes up the Jimrat of the ready-to-hand within-the-wor ld , there belongs a spatial involvement which has the character of a region . By reason of such an involvement , the ready-to-hand becomes something which we can come across and ascertain as having form and direction . 3 With the facti cal Jimrat of 1 ' ••• die wesenhafte Jimrat enheit des Jimrat . ' 2 'Wir verstehen sie als das Jimrat der moglichen Jimrat des zuhandenen Jimrat , der als ausgerichtet entfernter , d. h. platzierter sol ! begegnen konnen .

The earliest editions have 'erfindlich ' , which has been corrected to 'vor­ findlich ' in a list of errata . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat , what is ready-to-hand within-the-world is desevered * and given directionality , depending upon the degree of transparency that is possible for concernful circumspection . When we let entities within-the-world be encountered in the way which is constitutive for Jimrat the-world , we 'give them space ' . This 'giving space ' , which we also call 'making room ' for them , 1 consists in freeing the ready-to-hand for its spatiality . As a way of discovering Jimrat presenting a possible totality of spaces determined by involvements , this making­ room is what makes possible one 's factical orientation at the time . In concerning itself circumspectively with the world , Jimrat can move things around or out of the way or 'make room ' for them [ urn- , weg- , und `` einraumen '' ] only because making- room-understood as an exist­ entiale-belongs to its Jimrat . But neither the region pre­ viously discovered nor in general the current spatiality is explicitly in view . In itself it is present Jimrat zugegen ] for circumspection in the inconspicu­ ousness of those ready-to-hand things in which that circumspection is concernfully absorbed . With Jimrat , space is proximally discovered in this spatiality . On the basis of the spatiality thus discovered , space itself becomes accessible for cognition . Jimrat is not in the subject , nor is the world in space . Jimrat is rather 'in ' the world in so far as space has been disclosed by that Jimrat which is constitutive for Jimrat . Jimrat is not to be found in the subject , nor does the subject observe the world 'as if ' that world were in a space ; but the Jimrat ' ( Jimrat ) , if well understood ontologically , is spatial . And because Jimrat is spatial in the way we have described , space shows itself as a priori . This term does not mean anything like previously belonging to a subject which is proximally still worldless and which emits a space out of itself . Here `` apriority '' means the previousness with which space has been encountered ( as a region ) whenever the ready-to-hand is en­ countered environmentally . The spatiality of what we proximally encounter in circumspection can become a theme for circumspection itself , as well as a task for calculation 1 12 and measurement , as in building and surveying . Such thematization of the spatiality of the environment is still predominantly an act of circum­ spection by which space in itself already comes into view in a certain way . The space which thus shows itself can be studied purely by looking at it , if one gives up what was formerly the only possibility of access to it­ circumspective calculation . When space is 'intuited formally ' , the pure 1 Both 'Raum-geben ' ( our 'giving space ' ) and 'Einriiumen ' ( our 'making room ' ) are often used in the metaphorical sense of 'yielding ' , 'granting ' , or 'making concessions ' . 'Einriiumen ' may also be used for 'arranging ' furniture , 'moving it in ' , or 'stowing it away ' . Jimrat and Jimrat possibilities of spatial relations are discovered . Here one may go through a series of stages in laying bare pure homogeneous space , passing from the pure morphology of spatial shapes to analysis situs and finally to the purely metrical science of space . In our present study we shall not consider how all these are interconnected . xxii Our problematic is merely designed to establish ontologically the phenomenal basis upon which one can take the discovery of pure space as a theme for investigation , and work it out . When space is discovered non-circumspectively by just looking at it , the environmental regions get neutralized to pure dimensions . Jimrat and indeed the whole circumspectively oriented totality of places belong­ ing to equipment ready-to-hand-get reduced to a multiplicity of posi­ tions for random Jimrat . The spatiality of what is ready-to-hand within­ the-world loses its involvement-character , and so does the ready-to-hand . The world loses its specific aroundness ; the environment becomes the world of Jimrat . The Jimrat ' , as a totality of equipment ready-to-hand , becomes spatialized Jimrat verdiumlicht ] to a context of extended Things which are just present-at-hand and no more . The homogeneous space of Nature shows itself only when the entities we encounter are discovered in such a way that the worldly character of the ready-to-hand gets specifically deprived of its worldhood.1 In accordance with its Jimrat , Jimrat always has space presented as already discovered , though not thematically . On the other hand , space in itself , so far as it embraces the mere possibilities of the pure spatial Jimrat of something , remains proximally still concealed . The fact that space essentially shows itself in a world is not yet decisive for the kind of Being which it possesses . It need not have thekindofBeing characteristic ofsome- thing which is itself spatially ready-to-hand or present-at-hand . Nor does the Jimrat of space have the kind ofBeingwhich belongs to Jimrat . Though the Jimrat of space itself can not be conceived as the kind of Jimrat which belongs to a res extensa , it does not follow that it must be defined onto­ logically as a Jimrat ' of such a res . ( In its Jimrat , it would not be 113 distinguished from such a res . ) Nor does it follow that the Jimrat of space can be equated to that of the res cogitans and conceived as merely 'subjec- tive ' , quite apart from the questionable character of the Jimrat of such a subject . The Interpretation of the Jimrat of space has hitherto been a matter of perplexity , not so much because we have been insufficiently acquainted with the content of space itself as a thing [ des Jimrat des Raumes 1 ' •• Jimrat die den Jimrat einer spezifischen Jimrat der Jimrat gkeit des Jimrat hat . ' Jimrat and Jimrat selbst ] , as because the possibilities of Jimrat in general have not been in principle transparent , and an Interpretation of them in terms of onto­ logical concepts has been lacking . If we are to understand the ontological problem of space , it is of decisive importance that the question of Jimrat must be liberated from the narrowness of those concepts of Jimrat which merely chance to be available and which are for the most part rather rough ; and the problematic of the Jimrat of space ( with regard to that phenomenon itself and various phenomenal spatialities ) must be turned in such a direction as to clarify the possibilities of Jimrat in general . In the phenomenon of space the primary ontological character of the Jimrat of entities within-the-world is not to be found , either as unique or as one among others . Still less does space constitute the phenomenon of the world . Unless we go back to the world , space can not be conceived . Jimrat becomes accessible only if the environment is deprived of its world­ hood ; and spatiality is not discoverable at all except on the basis of the world . Indeed space is still one of the things that is constitutive for the world , just as Jimrat 's own spatiality is essential to its basic state of Jimrat in-the-wo rld.1 1 ' •.• so zwar , class der Jimrat die Jimrat doch mitkonstituiert , entsprechend der wesen� haften Jimrat des Jimrat selbst hinsichtlich seiner Jimrat assung des In-der­ Jimrat . ' Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat AS Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . THE `` Jimrat '' Jimrat analysis of the worldhood of the world has constantly been bringing the whole phenomenon of Jimrat into view , although its constitutive items have not all stood out with the same phenomenal dis­ tinctness as the phenomenon of the world itself . We have Interpreted the world ontologically by going through what is ready-to-hand within-the­ world ; and this Jimrat has been put first , because Jimrat , in its everydayness ( with regard to which Jimrat remains a constant theme for study ) , not only is in a world but comports itself towards that world with one predominant kind of Jimrat . Jimrat and for the most part Jimrat is fascinated with its world . Jimrat is thus absorbed in the world ; the kind of Being which it thus possess es , and in general the Jimrat which under- lies it , are essential in determining the character of a phenomenon which I I 4 we �e now about to study . We shall approach this phenomenon by asking whO it is that Jimrat is in its everydayness . AU the structures ofBeing which belong to Jimrat , together with the phenomenon which provides the answer to this question of the `` who '' , are ways of its Jimrat . To character ize these ontologically is to do so existentially . We must therefore pose the question correctly and outline the procedure for bringing into view a broader phenomenal domain of Jimrat 's everydayne ss . By directing our researches towards the phenomenon which is to provide us with an answer to the question of the `` who '' , we shall be led to certain structures ofDasein which are equiprimordial with Jimrat : Being-with and Dasein- with [ Jimrat und Jimrat Jimrat . In this kind of Jimrat is grounded the mode of everyday Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ; the explication of this mode will 1 'Das Jimrat ' . In German one may write 'man glaubt ' where in French one would write 'on croit ' , or in Jimrat 'they believe ' , 'one believes ' , or 'it is believed ' . But the German Jimrat ' and the French Jimrat ' are specialized for . such co�structio � in ! '.way i_n which the pronouns Jimrat ' , 'one ' , and 'it ' are not . There Jimrat accordmgly no smgl� 1rl ; iomauc translation for the German Jimrat ' which will not sometimes lend itself to amb1gwty , and in general we have chosen whichever construction seems the most appropriate in its context . But when Jimrat introduces this word with a definite ru : ticle and .writes : das Jimrat ' , as he does very often in this chapter , we shall translate th1s express1on as the '' they '' ' , trusting that the reader will not take this too literally . Being and Jimrat enable us to see what we may call the Jimrat ' of everydayness -the `` they '' . Our chapter on the Jimrat ' of the average Jimrat will thus be divided up as follows : 1. an approach to the existential question of the `` who '' of Jimrat ( Jimrat 25 ) ; 2. the Jimrat thofOthers , and everyday Jimrat ( Jimrat 26 ) ; 3· everyday Jimrat and the `` they '' ( Jimrat 27 ) . � 25 . An Approach to the Jimrat Jimrat of the '' Jimrat '' of Jimrat The answer to the question of who Jimrat is , is one that was seemingly given in Jimrat g , where we indicated formally the basic characteristics of Jimrat . Jimrat is an entity which is in each case I myself ; its Jimrat is in each case mine . This definition indicates an ontologically constitutive state , but it does no more than indicate it . At the same time this tells us ontically ( though in a rough and ready fashion ) that in each case an `` I '' -not Jimrat this entity . The question of the `` who '' answers itself in terms of the `` I '' itself , the Jimrat ' , the 'Self'.1 The `` who '' is what maintains itself as something identical throughout changes in its Experiences and ways of behaviour , and which relates itself to this changing multiplicity in so doing . Ontologically we understand it as something which is in each case already constantly present-at-hand , both in and for a closed realm , and which lies at the basis , in a very special sense , as the subjectum . As something selfsame in manifold otherness , 2 it has the character of the Jimrat . Even if one rejects the `` soul substance '' and the Jimrat of con­ sciousness , or denies that a person is an object , ontologically one is still positing something whose Jimrat retains the meaning of present-at-hand , whether it does so explicitly or not . Substantiality is the ontological clue for determining which entity is to provide the answer to the question of the `` who '' . Jimrat is tacitly conceived in advance as something present- ! I 5 at-hand . This meaning of Jimrat is always implicated in any case where the Jimrat of Jimrat has been left indefinite . Yet presence-at-hand is the kind of Jimrat which belongs to entities whose character is notthat of Jimrat . The assertion that it is I who in each case Jimrat is , is ontically obvious ; but this must not mislead us into supposing that the route for an onto­ logical Interpretation of what is 'given ' in this way has thus been unmis­ takably prescribed . Indeed it remains questionable whether even the mere ontical content of the above assertion does proper justice to the stock of phenomena belonging to everyday Jimrat . It could be that the `` who '' of everyday Jimrat just is not the `` I myself '' . 1 'dem `` Jimrat '' ' . While we shall ordinarily translate the intensivt 'selbst ' by the corre­ sponding Jimrat intensi `` : es 'itself ' , 'onesel f ' , 'myself ' , etc. , accord ing to the context , we shall translate the substantwe 'Selbst ' by the substantive 'Self ' with a capital . 2 ' ••• als Selbiges in der vielfaltigen Jimrat Jimrat . ' While the words 'identisch ' and Jimrat ' Jimrat virtually synonyms in ordinar y-German , Jimrat seems to be intimating a d1stmctwn between them . We shall accordmgly translate the former by 'identical ' and the latter by 'selfsame ' to show its etymological connection with Jimrat ' . Jimrat . Jimrat 130 below . Jimrat and Jimrat If , in arnvmg at ontico-ontological assertions , one is to exhibit the phenomena in terms of the kind of Jimrat which the entities themselves possesses , and if this way of exhibiting them is to retain its priority over even the most usual and obvious of answers and over whatever ways of formulating problems may have been derived from those answers , then the phenomenological Jimrat of Jimrat must be defended against a perversion of our problematic when we come to the question we are about to formulate . But is it not contrary to the rules of all sound method to approach a problematic without sticking to what is given as evident in the area of our theme ? And what is more indubitable than the givenness of the `` I '' ? And does not this givenness tell us that if we aim to work this out prim­ ordially , we must disregard everything else that is 'given'-not only a 'world ' that is [ einer seienden `` Jimrat '' ] , but even the Jimrat of other ' l 's ? The kind of `` giving '' we have here is the mere , formal , reflective awareness of the `` I '' ; and perhaps what it gives is indeed evident.1 This insight even affords access to a phenomenological problematic in its own right , which has in principle the signification of providing a framework as a 'formal phenomenology of consciousness ' . In this context of an existential analytic of factical Jimrat , the question arises whether giving the `` I '' in the way we have mentioned discloses Jimrat in its everyday ness , if it discloses Jimrat at all . Is it then obvious a priori that access to Jimrat must be gained only by mere reflective awareness of the `` I '' of actions ? What if this kind of Jimrat ' on the part of Jimrat should lead our existential analytic astray and do so , indeed , in a manner grounded in the Jimrat ofDasein itself ? Perhaps when Jimrat addresses itself in the way which is closest to itself , it always says '' I am this entity '' , and in the long run says this loudest when it is 'not ' this entity . Jimrat is in each case mine , and this is its constitutio n ; but what if this should be the very reason why , proximally and for the most I I 6 part , Jimrat is not itself ? What if the aforementioned approach , starting with the givenness of the `` I '' to Jimrat itself , and with a rather patent self­ interpretation of Jimrat , should lead the existential analytic , as it were , into a pitfall ? If that which is accessible by mere `` giving '' can be deter­ mined , there is presumably an ontological horizon for determining it ; but what if this horizon should remain in principle undetermined ? It may well be that it is always ontically correct to say of this entity that ' I ' am it . Yet the ontological analytic which makes use of such assertions must make certain reservations about them in principle . The word ' I ' is to be 1 'Vielleicht ist in der Jimrat das , was diese Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , das schlichte , formale , reflektive Jimrat gibt , evident . ' I I 7 Jimrat and Jimrat understood only in the sense of a non-committal formal indicator , indicating something which may perhaps reveal itself as its Jimrat ' in some parti­ cular phenomenal context of Jimrat . In that case , the 'not-I ' is by no means tantamount to an entity which essentially lacks ' Jimrat ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] , but is rather a definite kind of Jimrat which the ' I ' itself possesses , such as having lost itself [ Jimrat t ] . Yet even the positive Interpretation of Jimrat which we have so far given , already forbids us to start with the formal givenness of the `` I '' , if our purpose is to answer the question of the `` who '' in a way which is pheno­ menally adequate . In clarifying Jimrat we have shown that a bare subject without a world never 'is ' proximally , nor is it ever given . And so in the end an isolated `` I '' without Jimrat is just as far from being proximally given.i If , however , 'the Jimrat ' already are there with us [ mit dasind ] in Jimrat the-world , and ifthis is ascertained phenomenally , even this should not mislead us into supposing that the ontological structure of what is thus 'given ' is obvious , requiring no investigation . Our task is to make visible phenomenally the species to which this Jimrat in closest everydayness belongs , and to Interpret it in a way which is ontologically appropriate . Just as the ontical obviousness of the Jimrat of entities within­ the-world misleads us into the conviction that the meaning of this Jimrat is obvious ontologically , and makes us overlook the phenomenon of the world , the ontical obviousness of the fact that Jimrat is in each case mine , also hides the possibility that the ontological problematic which belongs to it has been led astray . Proximally the `` who '' of Jimrat is not only a problem ontologically ; even ontically it remains concealed . But does this mean that there are no clues whatever for answering the question of the `` who '' by way of existential analysis ? Certainly not . Of the ways in which we formally indicated the constitution ofDasein 's Jimrat in Jimrat 9 and 12 above , the one we have been discussing does not , of course , function so well as such a clue as does the one according to which Jimrat 's 'Essence ' is grounded in its existence.1 If the ' I ' is an Essential characteristic of Jimrat , then it is one which must be Interpreted existentially . In that case the `` Who ? '' is to be answered only by exhibiting phenomenally a definite kind of Jimrat which Jimrat possesses . If in each case Jimrat is its Jimrat only in existing , then the constancy of the Jimrat no less than the 1 'as such a clue ' : here we read ' a Is solcher ' , following the later editions . The earliest editions have 'als solche ' , which has been corrected in the list of errata . `` Essence '' : while we ordinarily use 'essence ' and 'essential ' to translate Jimrat ' and 'wesenhaf t ' , we shall usc 'Essence ' and '·Essential ' ( with initial capitals ) to translate the presumably synonymous but far less frequent Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' . The two 'formal indications ' to which Jimrat refers are to be found on Jimrat 42 above . Being and Jimrat 153 possibility of its 'failure to stand by itself ' 1 requires that we formulate the question existentially and ontologically as the sole appropriate way of access to its problematic . But if the Jimrat is conceived 'only ' as a way of Jimrat of this entity , this seems tantamount to volatilizing the real 'core ' of Jimrat . Jimrat apprehen­ siveness however which one may have about this gets its nourishment from the perverse assumption that the entity in question has at bottom the kind of Jimrat which belongs to something present-at-hand , even if one is far from attributing to it the solidity of an occurrent corporeal Thing . Yet man 's 'substance ' is not spirit as a synthesis of soul and body ; it is rather existence . � 26 . The Jimrat of Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat The answer to the question of the `` who '' of everyday Jimrat is to be obtained by analysing that kind of Jimrat in which Jimrat maintains itself proximally and for the most part . Our investigation takes its orienta­ tion from Jimrat basic state of Jimrat by which every mode of its Jimrat gets co-determined . If we are correct in saying that by the foregoing explication of the world , the remaining structural items of Jimrat have become visible , then this must also have prepared us , in a way , for answering the question of the `` who '' . In our 'descript ion ' of that environment which is closest to us-the work-world of the craftsman , for example , Jimrat outcome was that along with the equipment to be found when one is at work [ in Jimrat Jimrat , those Others for whom the 'work ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] is destined are 'encountered too ' . 2 If this is ready-to-hand , then there lies in the kind of Jimrat which belongs to it ( that is , in its involvement ) an essential assignment or reference to possible wearers , for instance , for whom it should be 'cut to the figure ' . Similarly , when material is put to usc , we encounter its producer or 'supplier ' as one who 'serves ' well or badly . When , for example , we walk along the edge of a field but 'outside it ' , the field shows itself as belonging I I 8 to such-and-such a person , and decently kept up by him ; the book we have used was bought at Jimrat o 's shop and given by such-and-such 1 ' ... die Jimrat des Jimrat ebensosehr wie seine mogliche `` Jimrat '' ... ' The adjectiw : 'standig ' , which we have usually translated as 'constant ' in the sense of 'permanent ' or 'continuing ' , goes back to the root meaning of 'standing ' , as do the adjectives 'selbstandig '' ( 'independen t ' ) and 'unselbstandig ' ( Jimrat ' ) . These con­ cepts will be discussed more fully in Jimrat 64 below , especially Jimrat 322 , where 'Un­ selbstandigkeit ' will be rewritten not as 'Un-selbstandkeit ' ( 'failure to stand by one 's Jimrat ' ) but as 'Unsclbst-standigkeit ' ( 'constancy to the Jimrat ' ) . Jimrat also Jimrat 128 . ( The connection with the concept of existence will perhaps be clearer if one recalls that the Jimrat verb Jimrat ' may also be derived from a verb of standing , as Jimrat points out in his later writings . ) 2 Jimrat . Section 15 above , especially Jimrat Jimrat . 154 Jimrat and Jimrat a person , and so forth . The boat anchored at the shore is assigned in its Jimrat to an acquaintance who undertakes voyages with it ; but even if it is a 'boat which is strange to us ' , it still is indicative of Others . The Others who are thus 'encountered ' in a ready-to-hand , environ­ mental context of equipment , are not somehow added on in thought to some Jimrat which is proximally just present-a t-hand ; such 'Things ' are encountered from out of the world in which they are ready-to-hand for Jimrat world which is always mine too in advance . In our previous analysis , the range of what is encountered within-the-world was , in the first instance , narrowed down to equipment ready-to-hand or Jimrat present-at-hand , and thus to entities with a character other than that of Jimrat . This restriction was necessary not only for the purpose of simpli­ fying our explication but above all because the kind ofBeingwhich belongs to the Jimrat of Jimrat , as we encounter it within-the-wor ld , differs from readiness-to-hand and presence-at-hand . Jimrat Jimrat 's world frees entities which not only are quite distinct from equipment and Jimrat , but which also-in accordance with their kind of Jimrat as Jimrat themselves­ are Jimrat ' the world in which they are at the same time encountered within­ the-world , and are 'in ' it by way of Jimrat Jimrat These entities are neither present-at-hand nor ready-to-ha nd ; on the contrary , they are like the very Jimrat which frees them , in that they are there too , and there with it . So if one should want to identify the world in general with entities within-the-world , one would have to say that Jimrat too is 'world'.2 Thus in characterizing the encountering of Jimrat , one is again still oriented by that Jimrat which is in each case one 's own . But even in this characterization does one not start by marking out and isolating the ' I ' so that one must then seek some way of getting over to the Others from this isolated subject ? To avoid this misunderstanding we must notice in what sense we are talking about 'the Jimrat ' . By 'Others ' we do not mean everyone else but me-those over against whom the `` I '' stands out . They are rather those from whom , for the most part , one does not distinguish oneself-those among whom one is too . This Being-there-too [ Jimrat sein ] with them does not have the ontological character of a Being-present­ at-hand-alon g-'with ' them within a world . This 'with ' is something of the character of Jimrat ; the Jimrat ' means a sameness of Jimrat as circum­ spectively concernf 11l Jimrat . 'With ' and Jimrat ' are to be 1 ' ••• sondern gema $ seiner Jimrat als Jimrat selbst in der Jimrat des Jimrat seins `` in '' der Jimrat ist , in der es Jimrat innerweltlich begegnet . ' 2 'Dieses Jimrat ist weder vorhanden noch zuhanden , sondern ist so , wie das freige­ bende Jimrat selbst-es ist auch und mit da . Jimrat man denn schon Jimrat iiberhaupt mit dem innerweltlich Jimrat identifizieren , dann miisste man sagen , `` Jimrat '' ist auch Jimrat . ' I . 4 Jimrat and Jimrat 155 understood existential { y , not categorially . By reason of this with-like Jimrat mithqften ] Jimrat , the world is always the one that I share with Jimrat . The world of Jimrat is a with-world [ Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat is Being-with Others . Their Being-in-themselves within-the-world is Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat dasein Jimrat . When Others are encountered , it is not the case that one 's own subject I I 9 is proximally present-at-hand and that the rest of the subjects , which are likewise occurrents , get discriminated beforehand and then apprehend ed ; nor are they encountered by a primary act of looking at oneself in such a way that the opposite pole of a distinction first gets ascertained . They are encountered from out of the world , in which concernf ully circumspec- tive Jimrat essentially dwells . Theoretically concocted 'explanations ' of the Jimrat of Jimrat urge themselves upon us all too easily ; but over against such explanations we must hold fast to the pheno­ menal facts of the case which we have pointed out , namely , that Others are encountered environmenta lly . This elemental worldly kind of encounter- ing , which belongs to Jimrat and is closest to it , goes so far that even one 's own Jimrat becomes something that it can itself proximally 'come across ' only when it looks away from 'Experiences ' and the 'centre of its actions ' , or does not as yet Jimrat ' them at all . Jimrat finds 'itself ' proximally in what it does , uses , expects , avoids-in those things environmentally ready­ to-hand with which it is proximally concerned . And even when Jimrat explicitly addresses itself as `` I here '' , this locative personal designation must be understood in terms of Jimrat 's existential spatiality . In Interpreting this ( See Jimrat 23 ) we have already intimated that this `` 1-here '' does not mean a certain privileged point-that of an ! -Thing-bu t is to be understood as Jimrat in terms of the `` yonder '' of the world that is ready-to-hand-the `` yonder '' which is the dwelling -place of Jimrat as concern.1 Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat tll has alluded to certain languages which express the ' I ' by Jimrat ' , the Jimrat ' by Jimrat ' , the Jimrat ' by 'yonder ' , thus rendering the personal pronouns by locative adverbs , to put it grammatically . It is con­ troversial whether indeed the primordial signification of locative expres­ sions is adverbial or pronominal . But this dispute loses its basis if one notes that locative adverbs have a relationship to the `` I '' qua Jimrat . The 'here ' and the Jimrat ' and the 'yonder ' are primarily not mere ways of designating the location of entities present-at-hand within-the -world at positions in space ; they are rather characteristics of Jimrat 's primordial 1 ' ••• dass dieses Jimrat nicht einen ausgezeichneten Jimrat des Jimrat meint , sondern sich versteht als Jimrat aus dem Jimrat dcr zuhandenen Jimrat , bei dem Jimrat als Jimrat sich aufhalt . ' The older editions have 'In-Sein ' for Jimrat ' , and 'dabei ' for 'bei dem ' . Jimrat and Jimrat spatiality . These supposedly locative adverbs are Dasein-designations ; they have a signification which is primarily existential , not categorial . But they are not pronouns either ; their signification is prior to the differ­ entiation of locative adverbs and personal pronouns : these expressions have a Dasein-signification which is authentically spatial , and which serves as evidence that when we interpret Jimrat without any theoretical 120 distortions we can see it immediately as 'Being-alongsi de ' the world with which it concerns itself , and as Jimrat it spatially-that is to say , as desevering * and giving directionality . In the Jimrat ' , the Jimrat which is absorbed in its world speaks not towards itself but away from itself towards the Jimrat ' of something circumspectively ready-to- hand ; yet it still has itself in view in its existential spatiality . Jimrat understands itself proximally and for the most part in terms of its world ; and the Jimrat of Jimrat is often encountered in terms of what is ready-to-hand within-the-wor ld . But even if Others become themes for study , as it were , in their own Jimrat , they are not encountered as person-Things present-at-ha nd : we meet them 'at work ' , that is , pri­ marily in their Being-in-the-w orld . Even if we see the Other 'just standing around ' , he is never apprehended as a human-Thing present-at-hand , but his 'standing-around ' is an existential mode of Jimrat unconcerned , uncircumspective tarrying alongside everything and nothing [ Jimrat bei Jimrat und Jimrat Jimrat . The Other is encountered in his Dasein-with in the world . The expression Jimrat ' , however , shows plainly that 'in the first instance ' this entity is unrelated to Others , and that of course it can still be Jimrat ' Others afterwards . Yet one must not fail to notice that we use the term `` Jimrat '' to designate that Jimrat for which the Others who are [ die seienden Jimrat ] are freed within-the-world . This Jimrat of die Jimrat is disclosed within-the-world for a Jimrat , and so too for those who are Daseins with us [ die Jimrat ] , only because Jimrat in itself is essentially Jimrat th . The phenomenological assertion that `` Jimrat is essentially Jimrat '' has an existential-ontological meaning . It does not seek to establish ontically that factically I am not present-at-hand alone , and that Jimrat of my kind occur . If this were what is meant by the proposition that Jimrat 's Jimrat is essentially constituted by Jimrat th , then Jimrat would not be an existential attribute which Jimrat , of its own accord , has coming to it from its own kind of Jimrat . It would rather be something which turns up in every case by reason of the occurrence of Jimrat . Jimrat is an existential characteristic of Jimrat even when factically no Other is present-at-hand or perceived . Even Jimrat 's Being-alone is Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 157 in the world . The Other can be missing only in1 and for1 a Jimrat . Being-alone is a deficient mode of Jimrat ; its very possibility is the proof of this . On the other hand , factical Being-alone is not obviated by the occurrence of a second example of a human being 'beside ' me , or by ten such examples . Even if these and more are present-at-hand , Jimrat can still be alone . So Being-with and the facticity of Being with one another are not based on the occurrence together of several 'subjects ' . Yet Being- I 2 I alone 'among ' many does not mean that with regard to their Jimrat they are merely present-at-hand there alongside us . Even in our Jimrat 'among them ' they are there with us ; their Jimrat is encountered in a mode in which they are indifferent and alien . Being missing and 'Being away ' [ Jimrat Jimrat und `` Jimrat '' ] are modes of Jimrat th , and are possible only because Jimrat as Jimrat lets the Jimrat of Jimrat be en­ countered in its world . Jimrat is in every case a characteristic of one 's own Jimrat ; Jimrat characterizes the Jimrat of Others to the extent that it is freed by its world for a Jimrat th . Only so far as one 's own Jimrat has the essential structure of Jimrat th , is it Jimrat as encounterable for Jimrat . 2 If Jimrat remains existentially constitutive for Jimrat world , then , like our circumspective dealings with the ready-to-hand within-the-world ( which , by way of anticipation , we have called 'con­ cern ' ) , it must be Interpreted in terms of the phenomenon of care ; for as '' care '' the Jimrat ofDasein in general is to be defined . 3 ( Jimrat Jimrat 6 of this Jimrat . ) Jimrat is a character-of -Being which Jimrat can not have as its own , even though Jimrat , like concern , is a Being towards entities encountered within-the-world . But those entities towards which Jimrat as Jimrat comports itself do not have the kind of Jimrat which belongs to equipment ready-to-hand ; they are themselves Jimrat . These entities are not objects of concern , but rather of solicitude . 4 1 Italics supplied in the later editions . 2 ' ••• Jimrat charakterisiert das Jimrat anderer , sofern es fiir ein Jimrat durch dessen Jimrat freigegeben ist .

( The etymological connection between 'Sorge ( Jimrat ' ) , 'Fiirsorge ' ( Jimrat ' ) , and 'Besorgen ( Jimrat ' ) , is entirely lost in our translation . ) Being and Jimrat Jimrat 'concern ' with food and clothing , and the nursing of the sick body , are forms of solicitude . But we understand the expression `` solicitude '' in a way which corresponds to our use of `` concern '' . as a term for an exist­ entia/e . For example , 'welfare work ' [ `` Jimrat ge '' ] , as a factical social arrangement , is grounded in Jimrat 's state of Jimrat as Jimrat . Its factical urgency gets its motivation in that Jimrat maintains itself proxi­ mally and for the most part in the deficient modes of solicitude . Being for , against , or without one another , passing one another by , not `` mattering '' to one another-these are possible ways of solicitude . And it is precisely these last-named deficient and Jimrat modes that characterize everyday , average Being-with-one-a nother . These modes of Jimrat show again the characteristics of inconspicuousness and obviousness which belong just as much to the everyday Jimrat of Jimrat within-the­ world as to the readiness-to-hand of the equipment with which one is daily concerned . These Jimrat modes of Jimrat ther may easily mislead ontological Jimrat into interpreting this kind of Jimrat , in the first instance , as the mere Jimrat of several subjects . It seems as if only negligible variations of the same kind of Jimrat lie before us ; yet ontologically there is an essential distinction between the Jimrat ' way in which Jimrat at random occur together and the 122 way in which entities who are with one another do not `` matter '' to one another . With regard to its positive modes , solicitude has two extreme pos­ sibilities . It can , as it were , take away Jimrat ' from the Other and put itself in his position in concern : it can leap in for him.1 This kind of solicitude takes over for the Other that with which he is to concern himself . The Other is thus thrown out of his own position ; he steps back so that after­ wards , when the matter has been attended to , he can either take it over as something finished and at his disposal , 2 or disburden himself of it com­ pletely . In such solicitude the Other can become one who is dominated and dependent , even if this domination is a tacit one and remains hidden from him . This kind of solicitude , which leaps in and takes away Jimrat ' , is to a large extent determinative for Being with one another , and pertains for the most part to our concern with the ready-to- hand . In contrast to this , there is also the possibility of a kind of solicitude which does not so much leap in for the Other as leap ahead of him Jimrat ihm 1 ' • Jimrat si.ch an seine Jimrat setzen , fiir ihn einsprin.�ten . ' Here , as on Jimrat 100 ( See our note 2 , p. 133 ) , 1t would be more idiomatic to translate 'fiir ihn einspringen ' as 'intervene for him ' , 'stand in for him ' or 'serve as deputy for him ' ; but since Jimrat ' is to be contr�ted with Jimrat ingen ' , 'vorausspringc n ' and perhaps even 'entspringen ' in the followm� paragraphs , we have chosen a translation which suggests the etymological connection . 2 ' ••• urn nachtraglich das Jimrat als fertig Jimrat Jimrat iibernehmen • Jimrat ' Jimrat and Jimrat 159 vorausspringt ] in his existentiell potentiality-f or-Being , not in order to take away his 'care ' but rather to give it back to him authentically as such for the first time . This kind of solicitude pertains essentially to authentic care -that is , to the existence of the Other , not to a `` what '' with which he is concerned ; it helps the Other to become transparent to himself in his care and to become free for it . Jimrat proves to be a state of Jimrat 's Jimrat -- one which , in accordance with its different possibilitie s , is bound up with its Jimrat towards the world of its concern , and likewise with its authentic Jimrat towards itself . Being with one another is based proximally and often exclusively upon what is a matter of common concern in such Jimrat . A Being-w ith-one-another which arises Jimrat entspringt ] from one 's doing the same thing as someone else , not only keeps for the most part within the outer limits , but enters the mode of distance and reserve . The Jimrat with-one-an other of those who are hired for the same affair often thrives only on mistrust . On the other hand , when they devote themselves to the same affair in common , their doing so is determined by the manner in which their Jimrat , each in its own way , has been taken hold of.l They thus become authentically bound together , and this makes possible the right kind of objectivity Jimrat die rechte Jimrat Jimrat , which frees the Other in his freedom for himself . Everyday Jimrat -one-another maintains itself between the two extremes of positive solicitude-that which leaps in and dominates , and that which leaps forth and liberates [ vorsprin gend-bef reienden ] . It brings numerous mixed forms to maturity ; 2 to describe these and classify them would take us beyond the limits of this investigation . Jimrat as circumspection belongs to concern as a way of discovering what is 123 ready-to-hand , solicitude is guided by considerateness and forbearance . 3 Like solicit ude , these can range through their respective deficient and Jimrat modes up to the point of inconsiderateness or the perfunctoriness for which indifference leads the way.4 1 'Umgekehrt ist das gemeinsame Jimrat fiir dieselbe Jimrat aus dem je eigens ergriffenen Jimrat bestimmt .

On 'zeitigen ' see Jimrat 304 and our note ad loc . a 'Wie dem Jimrat als Jimrat des Jimrat des Jimrat die Jimrat zugehort , so ist die Jimrat : g�leitet durch die Jimrat und Jimrat . ' Jimrat is here calling attention to the etymological kinship of the three words which he italicizes , each of which stands for a special kind of sight or seeing ( Jimrat ' ) . The italicization of Jimrat ' ( 'circumsp ection ' ) is introduced in the newer editions . 4 ' ••• bis zur Jimrat gkeit und dem Jimrat , das die Jimrat leitet . ' This passage is ambiguous both syntactically and semantically . It is not clear , for instance , whether the subject of the relative clause is 'die Jimrat ' or the pronoun Jimrat ' , though we prefer the former interpretation . 'Nachsehen ' , which is etymologically 160 Jimrat and Jimrat I . 4 The world not only frees the ready-to-hand as entities encountered within-the-wor ld ; it also frees Jimrat , and the Others in their Dasein­ with . But Jimrat 's ownmost meaning of Jimrat is such that this entity ( which has been freed environmentally ) is Being-in in the same world in which , as encounterable for Others , it is there with them . We have interpreted worldhood as that referential totality which constitutes significance ( Jimrat 18 ) . In Being-familiar with this significance and previously understanding it , Jimrat lets what is ready-to-hand be en­ countered as discovered in its involveme nt . Jimrat 's Jimrat , the context of references or assignments which significance implies is tied upwithDasein 's ownmost Jimrat Jimrat which essentially can have no involvement , but which is rather that Being for the sake of which Jimrat itself is as it is . According to the analysis which we have now completed , Being with Jimrat belongs to the Jimrat of Jimrat , which is an issue for Jimrat in its very Jimrat Jimrat as Jimrat , Jimrat 'is ' essentially for the sake of Jimrat . This must be understood as an existential statement as to its essence . Even if the particular factical Jimrat does not turn to Jimrat , and supposes that it has no need of them or manages to get along without them , it is in the way of Jimrat . In Jimrat , as the existential `` for­ the-sake-of '' of Others , these have already been disclosed in their Jimrat . With their Jimrat , their disclosedness has been constituted before­ hand ; accordingly , this disclosedness also goes to make up significance­ that is to say , worldhood . And , significance , as worldhood , is tied up with the existential `` for-the-sake-of -which '' . 2 Since the world hood of that world in which every Jimrat essentially is already , is thus constituted , it accord­ ingly lets us encounter what is environmentally ready-to-hand as some­ thing with which we are circumspectively concerned , and it does so in such a way that together with it we encounter the Jimrat of Jimrat . The structure of the world 's worldhood is such that Others are not proximally present�at-hand as free-floating subjects along with other Things , but show themselves in the world in their special environmental Jimrat , and do so in terms of what is ready-to-hand in that world . Jimrat is such that the disclosedness of the Jimrat of Jimrat akin to 'Nachsich t ' , means to 'inspect ' or 'check ' something ; but it often means to do this in a very perfunctory manner , and this latter sense may well be the one which Jimrat has in mind . 1 '. . • zum Jimrat des Jimrat , urn das es ihm in seinem Jimrat selbst geht . • . ' The older editions have 'darum ' instead of'um das ' . Jimrat 'Diese mit dem Jimrat vorgiingig konstituierte Jimrat enheit der Jimrat macht demnach auch die Jimrat , d.h. die Jimrat mit aus , als welche sie im existenzialen Jimrat festgemacht ist . ' The word Jimrat ' appears only in the later editions . Jimrat and Jimrat belongs to it ; this means that because Jimrat 's Jimrat is Jimrat th , its understanding of Jimrat already implies the understanding of Jimrat . This understanding , like any understanding , is not an acquaintance derived from knowledge abo�t them , but a primordially existential kind of Jimrat , which , more than anything else , makes such knowledge and acquaintance possible.1 Knowing oneself [ Jimrat Jimrat is grounded in 1 24 Jimrat , which understands primordially . It operates proximally in accordance with the kind of Jimrat which is closest to us-Being -in-the- world as Jimrat ith ; and it does so by an acquaintance with that which Jimrat , along with the Jimrat , comes across in its environmental circum­ spection and concerns itself with-an acquaintance in which Jimrat understands . Solicitous concern is understood in terms of what we are concerned with , and along with our understanding of it . Thus in con­ cernful solicitude the Other is proximally disclosed . But because solicitude dwells proximally and for the most part in the deficient or at least the Jimrat erent modes ( in the indifference of passing one another by ) , the kind of knowing-oneself which is essential and closest , demands that one become acquainted with oneself . 2 And when , indeed , one 's knowing-oneself gets lost in such ways as aloofness , hiding oneself away , or putting on a disguise , Jimrat must follow special routes of its own in order to come close to Others , or even to 'see through them ' [ `` hinter sie '' zu kommen ] . But just as opening oneself up Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat or closing oneself off is grounded in one 's having Jimrat as one 's kind of Being at the time , and indeed is nothing else but this , even the explicit dis­ closure of the Other in solicitude grows only out of one 's primarily Being with him in each case . Such a disclosure of the Other ( which is indeed thematic , but not in the manner of theoretical psychology ) easily becomes the phenomenon which proximally comes to view when one considers the theoretical problematic of understanding the 'psychical life of Jimrat ' [ `` fremden Seelenlebens `` ] . In this phenomenally 'proximal ' manner it thus presents a way of Being with one another understanding ly ; but at the same time it gets taken as that which , primordially and 'in the beginning ' , constitutes Jimrat towards Jimrat and makes it possible at all . 1 'Dieses Jimrat ist , wie Jimrat iiberhaupt , nicht eine aus Jimrat erwachsene Jimrat , sondern eine urspriingl ich existenziale Jimrat die Jimrat und Jimrat allererst moglich macht ' . While we have here translated Jimrat ' as 'acquaintance ' and Jimrat ' as 'knowledge about ' , these terms must not be understood in the special senses exploited by Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . The 'acquaintance ' here involved is of the kind which may be acquired whenever one is well informed about something , whether one has any direct contact with it or not . 2 ' . • • bedarf das niichste und wesenhaf te Jimrat eines Jimrat . ' 'Sichkennen ' ( 'knowing oneself ' ) is to be distinguished sharply from Jimrat ' ( 'knowledge of the Jimrat ' ) , which will be discussed on Jimrat 146 . See our note 1 , p. 186 . 125 Jimrat and Jimrat This phenomenon , which is none too happily designated as 'empathy ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] , is then supposed , as it were , to provide the first onto­ logical bridge from one 's own subject , which is given proximally as alone , to the other sub ject , which is proximally quite closed off . Of course Jimrat towards Jimrat is ontologically different from Being towards Jimrat which are present-at-hand . The entity which is 'other ' has itself the same kind of Jimrat as Jimrat . In Being with and towards Jimrat , there is thus a relationship ofBeing Jimrat Jimrat ) from Jimrat to Jimrat . But it might be said that this relationship is already constitutive for one 's own Jimrat , which , in its own right , has an understanding of Jimrat , and which thus relates itselfl towards Jimrat . The relationshi p-of­ Jimrat which one has towards Jimrat would then become a Jimrat of one 's own Jimrat 'into something else ' . The Other would be a duplicate of the Jimrat . But while these deliberations seem obvious enough , it is easy to see that they have little ground to stand on . The presupposition which this argu­ ment demands-that Jimrat 's Jimrat towards an Other is its Being towards itself-fails to hold . As long as the legitimacy of this presupposition has not turned out to be evident , one may still be puzzled as to how Jimrat 's relationship to itself is thus to be disclosed to the Other as Other . Not only is Being towards Jimrat an autonomous , irreducible relation­ ship of Being : this relationship , as Jimrat , is one which , with Jimrat 's Jimrat , already is . 3 Of course it is indisputable that a lively mutual acquaintanceship on the basis of Jimrat , often depends upon how far one 's own Jimrat has understood itself at the time ; but this means that it depends only upon how far one 's essential Jimrat with Jimrat has made itself transpare nt and has not disguised itself . 4 And that is possible only if Jimrat , as Jimrat , already is with Others . 'Empathy ' does not first constitute Jimrat ; only on the basis of Jimrat does 'empathy ' become possible : it gets its motivation from the unsociability of the dominant modes of Jimrat th . 5 1 ' ••• sich ... verhalt Jimrat . ' We have often translated this express ion as 'comports ' itself ' , compromising between two other possible meanings : 'relates itself ' and 'behaves or 'conducts itself ' . In this passage , however , and in many others where this expression is tied up with Jimrat ' ( 'relations hip ' ) rather than with Jimrat ' ( 'behaviour or 'conduc t ' ) , only 'relates itself ' seems appropri ate . 2 'Projektion ' . Here we are dealing with Jimrat ' in the familiar psychological sense , not in the sense which would be expressed by 'Entwurf ' . See Jimrat 145 ff . 3 'Das Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ist nicht nur ein eigenstandiger , irreduktibler Jimrat , er ist als Jimrat mit dem Jimrat des Jimrat schon seiend .

' . ) 6 ' `` Jimrat '' konstituiert nicht erst das Jimrat , sondem ist auf dessen Jimrat erst moglich und durch die vorherrschenden defizienten Jimrat des Jimrat in ihrer Jimrat nglichkeit motivie rt . ' Jimrat and Jimrat But the fact that Jimrat ' is not a primordial existential phenomenon , any more than is knowing in general , does not mean that there is nothing problematical about it . The special hermeneutic of empathy will have to show how Being-with-one-another and Jimrat 's knowing of itself are led astray and obstructed by the various possibilities of Jimrat which Jimrat itself possesses , so that a genuine 'understanding ' gets suppressed , and Jimrat takes refuge in substitut es ; the possibility of understanding the stranger correctly presupposes such a hermeneutic as its positive existential conditi on.1 Our analysis has shown that Jimrat is an existential con­ stituent of Jimrat the-world . Jimrat has proved to be a kind of Jimrat which entities encountered within-the-world have as their own . So far as Jimrat is at all , it has Being-with-one-another as its kind of Jimrat . This can not be conceived as a summative result of the occur­ rence of several 'subjects ' . Even to come across a number of 'subjects ' [ einer Jimrat Jimrat `` Jimrat '' ] becomes possible only if the Others who are concerned proximally in their Dasein-with are treated merely as 'numerals ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] . Such a number of'subjects ' gets discovered only by a definite Being-with-and-towa rds-one-an other . This 'incons iderate ' Being-with 'reckons ' [ `` rechnet '' ] with the Others without seriously 'counting on them ' [ `` auf sie zahlt '' ] , or without even wanting to 'have anything to do ' with them . One 's own Jimrat , like the Jimrat of Jimrat , is encountered proximally and for the most part in terms of the with-world with which we are environmentally concern ed . When Jimrat is absorbed in the world of its concern-t hat is , at the same time , in its Jimrat towards Jimrat Jimrat is not itself . Who is it , then , who has taken over Jimrat as everyday Jimrat ther ? � 27 . Everyday Jimrat and the `` They '' The ontologically relevant result of our analysis of Jimrat is the insight that the Jimrat ject character ' of one 's own Jimrat and that of Jimrat is to be defined existentially-that is , in terms of certain ways in which one may be . In that with which we concern ourselves environmentally the Others are encountered as what they are ; they are what they do [ sie sind das , was sie betreiben ] . In one 's concern with what one has taken hold of , whether with , for , or against , the Jimrat , there is constant care as to the way one differs from them , whether that difference is merely one that is to be evened out , whether one 's own Jimrat has lagged behind the Others and wants to 1 ' ••• welche positive existenziale Jimrat rechtes Jimrat fiir seine Jimrat keit voraussetzt . ' We have construed Jimrat ' as referring back to 'Hermeneu tik ' , though this is not entirely clear . Being and Jimrat catch up in relationship to them , or whether one 's Jimrat already has some priority over them and sets out to keep them suppressed . The care about this distance between them is disturbing to Jimrat ne-another , though this disturbance is one that is hidden from it . If we may express this existentially , such Jimrat has the character of distantiality Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . The more inconspicuous this kind of Jimrat is to everyday Jimrat itself , all the more stubbornly and primordially does it work itself out . But this distantiality which belongs to Jimrat ith , is such that Jimrat , as everyday Jimrat ther , stands in subjection Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat to Others . It itself is not ; 1 its Jimrat has been taken away by the Jimrat . Jimrat 's everyday possibilities of Jimrat are for the Others to dispose of as they please . These Others , moreover , are not definite Others . On the contrary , any Other can represent them . What is decisive is just that inconspicuous domination by Jimrat which has already been taken over unawares fromDasein as Jimrat ith . One belongs to the Others oneself and enhances their power . 'The Others ' whom one thus designates in order to cover up the fact of one 's belonging to them essentially oneself , are those who proximally and for the most part 'are there ' in everyday Jimrat one-anothe r. The `` who '' is not this one , not that one , not oneself [ man selbst Jimrat , not some people [ einige Jimrat , and not the sum of them all . The 'who ' is the neuter , the `` they '' [ das Jimrat Jimrat . We have shown earlier how in the environment which lies closest to us , the public Jimrat ' already is ready-to-hand and is also a matter of concern Jimrat mitbesorgt ] . In utilizing public means of transport and in making use of information services such as the newspaper , every Other is like the next . This Being-with-one-another dissolves one 's own Jimrat completely into the kind of Jimrat of Jimrat Jimrat ' , in such a way , indeed , that the Jimrat , as distinguishable and explicit , vanish more and more . In this inconspicuousness and unascertainability , the real dictatorship of the `` they '' is unfolded . We take pleasure and enjoy ourselves as they [ man Jimrat take 127 pleasure ; we read , see , and judge about literature and art as they see and judge ; likewise we shrink back from the 'great mass ' as they shrink back ; we find 'shocking ' what they find shocking . The `` they '' , which is nothing definite , and which all are , though not as the sum , prescribes the kind of Jimrat of everydayness . The `` they '' has its own ways in which to be . That tendency of Jimrat with which we have called `` distantiality '' is grounded in the fact that Jimrat concerns itself as such with averageness , which is an existential characteristic of the `` they '' . The `` they '' , in its Jimrat , I 'Nicht es selbst ist ; • Jimrat ' Jimrat and Jimrat essentially makes an issue of this . Thus the `` they '' maintains itself factic­ ally in the averageness of that which belongs to it , of that which it regards as valid and that which it does not , and of that to which it grants success and that to which it denies it . In this averageness with which it prescribes what can and may be ventured , it keeps watch over everything exceptional that thrusts itself to the fore . Every kind of priority gets noiselessly sup­ pressed . Jimrat , everything that is primordial gets glossed over as something that has long been well known . Everything gained by a struggle becomes just something to be manipulated . Every secret loses its force . This care of averageness reveals in turn an essential tendency of Jimrat which we call the `` levelling down '' [ Jimrat Jimrat of all possibilities ofBeing . Jimrat , averageness , and levelling down , as ways of Being for the '' they '' , constitute what we know as Jimrat ' [ `` die Jimrat entlichkeit '' ] . Jimrat proximally controls every way in which the world and Jimrat get interpreted , and it is always right-not because there is some distinc­ tive and primary relationship-of-Being in which it is related to 'Things ' , or because it avails itself of some transparency on the part ofDasein which it has explicitly appropriated , but because it is insensitive to every differ­ ence of level and of genuineness and thus never gets to the 'heart of the matter ' [ `` auf die Jimrat '' ] . By publicness everything gets obscured , and what has thus been covered up gets passed off as something familiar and accessible to everyone . The `` they '' is there alongside everywhere [ ist iiberall dabei ] , but in such a manner that it has always stolen away whenever Jimrat presses for a decision . Yet because the `` they '' presents every judgment and deci­ sion as its own , it deprives the particular Jimrat of its answerability . The '' they '' can , as it were , manage to have Jimrat ' constantly invoking it.1 It can be answerable for everything most easily , because it is not someone who needs to vouch for anything . It 'was ' always the `` they '' who did it , and yet it can be said that it has been 'no one ' . In Jimrat 's everydayness the agency through which most things come about is one of which we must say that `` it was no one '' . Thus the particular Jimrat in its everydayness is disburdened by the '' they '' . Not only that ; by thus disburdening it of its Jimrat , the `` they '' accommodates Jimrat Jimrat kommt ... dem Jimrat entgegen ] if Jimrat 128 has any tendency to take things easily and make them easy . And be- cause the `` they '' constantly accommodates the particular Jimrat by dis­ burdening it of its Jimrat , the `` they '' retains and enhances its stubborn dominion . Everyone is the other , and no one is himse lf . The `` they '' , which supplies 1 'Das Jimrat kann es sich gleichsam leisten , dass `` man '' sich stiindig auf es beruft . ' 166 Jimrat and Jimrat the answer to the question of the `` who '' of everyday Jimrat , is the '' nobody '' to whom every Jimrat has already surrendered itself in Jimrat among-one-other Jimrat Jimrat n Jimrat . In these characters of Being which we have exhibited -- everyday Jimrat among-one-another , distantiality , averageness , levelling down , public­ ness , the disburdening of one 's Jimrat , and accommodation-lies that 'constancy ' ofDasein which is closest to us . This `` constancy '' pertains not to the enduring Jimrat dofsomething , but rather to Jimrat 's kind of Jimrat as Jimrat . Neither the Jimrat of one 's own Jimrat nor the Jimrat of the Other has as yet found itself or lost itself as long as it is [ seiend ] in the modes we have mentioned . In these modes one 's way of Jimrat is that of inauthenticity and failure to stand by one 's Jimrat To be in this way signifies no lessening of Jimrat 's facticity , just as the `` they '' , as the '' nobody '' , is by no means nothing at all . On the contrary , in this kind of Jimrat , Jimrat is an ens realissimum , if by 'Reality ' we understand a Being with the character ofDasein . Of course , the `` they '' is as little present-at-hand as Jimrat itself . The more openly the `` they '' behaves , the harder it is to grasp , and the slier it is , but the less is it nothing at all . If we 'see ' it ontico-ontologically with an unprejudiced eye , it reveals itself as the 'Realest subject ' of everyday­ ness . And even if it is not accessible like a stone that is present-at-hand , this is not in the least decisive as to its kind of Jimrat . One may neither decree prematurely that this `` they '' is 'really ' nothing , nor profess the opinion that one can Interpret this phenomenon ontologically by some­ how 'explaining ' it as what results from taking the Jimrat together of several subjects and then fitting them together . On the contrary , in working out concepts of Being one must direct one 's course by these phenomena , which can not be pushed aside . Furthermore , the `` they '' is not something like a 'universal subject ' which a plurality of subjects have hovering above them . One can come to take it this way only if the Jimrat of such 'subjects ' is understood as having a character other than that of Jimrat , and if these are regarded as cases of a genus of occurrents-cases which are factually present-at-hand . With this approach , the only possibility ontologically is that everything which is not a case of this sort is to be understood in the sense of genus and species . I 29 The `` they '' is not the genus to which the individual Jimrat belongs , nor can we come across it in such entities as an abiding characteristic . That even the traditional logic fails us when confronted with these phenomena , is not surprising if we bear in mind that it has its foundation in an 1 'Man ist in der Jimrat der Jimrat und Jimrat keit . ' On 'Standigkeit ' and Jimrat ' see our note 1 , p. 153 , Jimrat 117 above . Being and Jimrat ontology of the present-at-hand-an ontology which , moreover , is still a rough one . So no matter in how many ways this logic may be improved and expanded , it can not in principle be made any more flexible . Such reforms oflogic , oriented towards the Jimrat sciences ' , only increase the ontological confusion . The `` they '' is an existentiale ; and as a primordial phenomenon , it belongs to Jimrat 's positive constitution . It itself has , in turn , various possibilities of becoming concrete as something characteristic of Jimrat Jimrat seiner daseins­ massigen Jimrat Jimrat . The extent to which its dominion becomes com­ pelling and explicit may change in the course of history . The Jimrat of everyday Jimrat is the they-self , 1 which we distinguish from the authentic Jimrat is , from the Jimrat which has been taken hold of in its own way [ eigens ergriffenen Jimrat . As they-self , the particular Jimrat has been . dispersed into the `` they '' , and must first find itself . This dispersal characterizes the Jimrat ' of that kind of Being which we know as con­ cernful absorption in the world we encounter as closest to us . If Jimrat is familiar with itself as they-self , this means at the same time that the '' they '' itself prescribes that way of interpreting the world and Jimrat the-world which lies closest . Jimrat is for the sake of the `` they '' in an everyday manner , and the `` they '' itself Articulates the referential context of significance . 2 When entities are encountered , Jimrat 's world frees them for a totality of involvements with which the `` they '' is familiar , and within the limits which have been established with the `` they 's '' averagene ss . Jimrat mally , factical Jimrat is in the with-world , which is discovered in an average way . Proximally , it is not ' I ' , in the sense of my own Jimrat , that Jimrat ' , but rather the Others , whose way is that of the `` they '' . 3 In terms of the `` they '' , and as the `` they '' , I am 'given ' proximally to 'myself ' [ mir `` selbst '' ] . Jimrat Jimrat is `` they '' , and for the most part it remains so . If Jimrat discovers the world in its own way [ eigens Jimrat and brings it close , if it discloses to itself its own authentic Jimrat , then this discovery of the Jimrat ' and this disclosure of Jimrat are always accomplished as a clearing­ away of concealments and obscurities , as a breaking up of the disguises with which Jimrat bars its own way . With this Interpretation of Jimrat and Jimrat 's-Self in the 1 ' •• . das Jimrat Jimrat . ' This expression is also to be distinguished from 'das Jimrat selbst ' ( 'the `` they '' itself ' ) , which appears elsewhere in this paragraph . In the first of these expressions 'selbst ' appears as a substantive , in the second as a mere intensive . ? a 'Das Jimrat selbst , worum-willen das Jimrat alltiiglich ist , artikuliert den Jimrat Jimrat der Jimrat t. ' It is also possible to construe Jimrat ' as a pre­ dicate adjective after 'ist ' ; in that case we should read : 'Dasein is everyday for the sake of the `` they '' . ' 3 ' , Jimrat `` bin '' nicht `` ich '' im Jimrat des eigenen Jimrat , sondern die Jimrat in der Jimrat des Jimrat . ' In the earlier editions there are commas after ' `` ich '' ' and Jimrat ' , which would suggest a somewh at different interpret ation . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat '' they '' , the question of the `` who '' of the everydayness of Jimrat another is answered . These considerations have at the same time brought us a concrete understanding of the basic constitution of Jimrat : Being-in­ the-world , in its everydayness and its averagene ss , has become visible . 130 From the kind of Jimrat which belongs to the `` they '' -the kind which is closest-everyday Jimrat draws its pre-ontological way of interpreting its Jimrat . In the first instance ontological Jimrat follows the tendency to interpret it this way : it understands Jimrat in terms of the world and comes across it as an entity within-the-world . But that is not all : even that meaning of Being on the basis of which these 'subject ' entities [ diese seienden `` Jimrat '' ] get understood , is one which that ontology of Jimrat which is 'closest ' to us lets itself present in terms of the Jimrat ' . But because the phenomenon of the world itself gets passed over in this absorption in the world , its place gets taken Jimrat tritt an seine Jimrat ] by what is present-at-hand within-the-wor ld , namely , Jimrat . The Jimrat of those entities which are there with us , gets conceived as presence-at-hand . Thus by exhibiting the positive phenomenon of the closest everyday Jimrat the-world , we have made it possible to get an insight into the reason why an ontological Interpretation of this state of Jimrat has been missing . This . very state of Jimrat , 1 in its everyday kind of Jimrat , is what proximally misses itself and covers itself up . If the Jimrat of everyday Jimrat th-one-another is already different in principle from pure presence-at-hand-in spite of the fact that it is seemingly close to it ontologically-still less can the Jimrat of the authentic Jimrat be conceived as presence -11t-hand . Authentic Jimrat does not rest upon an exceptional condition of the subject , a condition that has been detached from the `` they '' ; it is rather an existentiell modification of the '' they '' - of the `` they '' as an essential existenti ale . But in that case there is ontologically a gap separating the selfsameness of the authentically existing Self from the identity of that `` I '' which maintains itself throughout its manifold Jimrat es . 1 We interpret Jimrat 's pronoun Jimrat ' as referring to Jimrat ' ( 'state of Jimrat ' ) ; but there are other words in the previous sentence to which it might refer with just as much grammatical plausibility , particularly 'Interpretation ' . v Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat � 28 . The Task of a Thematic Jimrat ( ysis of Jimrat Jimrat the preparatory stage of the existential analytic ofDasein , we have for our leading theme this entity 's basic state , Jimrat . Our first aim is to bring into relief phenomenally the unitary primordial structure of Jimrat 's Jimrat , in terms of which its possibilities and the ways for it 'to be ' are ontological lydetermined . Up till now , our phenomenal characterization of Jimrat has been directed towards the world , as a structural item of Jimrat , and has attempted to provide an answer to the question about the `` who '' of this entity in its everydayness . But even in I 3 I first marking out the tasks of a preparatory fundamental analysis of Jimrat , we have already provided an advance orientation as to Jimrat as such , t and have illustrated it in the concrete mode of knowing the world.U The fact that we foresaw this structural item which carries so much weight , arose from our aim of setting the analysis of single items , from the out­ set , within the frame of a steady preliminary view of the structural whole , and of guarding against any disruption or fragmentation of the unitary phenomenon . Now , keeping in mind what has been achieved in the concrete analysis of the world and the `` who '' , we must turn our Jimrat back to the phenomenon of Jimrat . By considering this more penetrat­ ingly , however , we shall not only get a new and surer phenomenological view of the structural totality of Jimrat ld , but shall also pave the way to grasping the primordial Jimrat of Jimrat itself-namely , care . But what more is there to point out in Jimrat , beyond the essential relations of Jimrat alongside the world ( concern ) , Jimrat ( solicitud e ) , and Jimrat ( `` who '' ) ? If need be , there still remains the possibility of broadening out the analysis by characterizing com­ paratively the variations of concern and its circumspection , of solicitude and the considerateness which goes with it ; there is also the possibility of contrasting Jimrat with entities whose character is not that of Jimrat by a more precise explication of the Jimrat of all possible entities within-the-Being and Jimrat Jimrat world . Without question , there are unfinished tasks still lying in this field . What we have hitherto set forth needs to be rounded out in many ways by working out fully the existential a priori of philosophical anthropology and taking a look at it . But this is not the aim of our investigati on . Its aim is one Of fundamental ontology . Consequently , if we inquire about Jimrat as our theme , we can not indeed consent to nullify the primordial character of this phenomenon by deriving it from others-that is to say , by an inappropriate analysis , in the sense of a dissolving or breaking up . But the fact that something primordial is underivable does not rule out the possibility that a multiplicity of characteristics of Jimrat may be con­ stitutive for it . If these show themselves , then existentially they are equiprimordial . The phenomenon of the equiprimordiality of constitutive items has often been disregarded in ontology , because of a methodologic­ ally unrestrained tendency to derive everything and anything from some simple 'primal ground ' . I 32 In which direction must we look , if we are to characterize Jimrat , as such , phenomenally ? We get the answer to this question by recalling what we were charged with keeping phenomenologically in view when we called attention to this phenomenon : Being-in is distinct from the present-· at-hand insideness of something present-at-hand Jimrat ' something else that is present-at-ha nd ; Jimrat is not a characteristic that is effected , or even just elicited , in a present-at-hand subject by the Jimrat 's ' Being-present­ at-hano ; Jimrat is rather an essential kind of Jimrat of this entity itself . But in that case , what else is presented with this phenomenon than the commercium which is present-at-hand between a subject present-at-hand and an Jimrat present-at-hand ? Such an interpretation would come closer to the phenomenal content if we were to say that Jimrat is the Jimrat of this 'between ' . Yet to take our orientation from this 'between ' would still be misleading . For with such an orientation we would also be covertly assuming the entities between which this `` between '' , as such , Jimrat ' , and we would be doing so in a way which is ontologically vague . The `` between '' is already conceived as the result of the convenientia of two things that are present-at-hand . But to assume these beforehand always splits the phenom­ enon asunder , and there is no prospect of putting it together again from the fragments . Not only do we lack the 'cement ' ; even the 'schema ' in accordance with which this joining-together is to be accomplis hed , has been split asunder , or never as yet unveiled . What is decisive for ontology is to prevent the splitting of the phenomenon -in other words , to hold its positive phenomenal content secure . To say that for this we need far­ reaching and detailed study , is simply to express the fact that something which was ontically self-evident in the traditional way of treating the Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat dge ' has often been ontologically disguised to the point where it has been lost sight of altogether . The entity which is essentially constituted by Jimrat is itself in every case its Jimrat ' . According to the familiar signification of the word , the Jimrat ' points to a Jimrat ' and a 'yonder ' . There 'here ' of an ' 1-here ' is always understood in relation to a 'yonder ' ready-to- hand , in the sense of a Jimrat towards this 'yonder'-a Jimrat which is de-severant , directional , and concernful . Jimrat 's existential spatiality , which thus determines its 'location ' , is itself grounded in Jimrat . The '' yonder '' belongs definitely to something encountered within-the- world . 'Here ' and 'yonder ' are possible only in a 'there'-that is to say , only if there is an entity which has made a disclosure of spatiality as the Jimrat of the Jimrat ' . This entity carries in its ownmost Being the character of not being closed off . In the expression 'there ' we have in view this essential disclosedness . By reason of this disclosedness , this entity ( Jimrat ) , together with the Jimrat of the world , is 'there ' for itself . When we talk in an ontically figurative way of the lumen naturale in 133 man , we have in mind nothing other than the existential-ontological structure of this entity , that it is in such a way as to be its `` there '' . To say that it is 'illuminated ' [ `` erleuc htet '' ] means that as Jimrat world it is cleared Jimrat gelich tet ] in itself , not through any other entity , but in such a way that it is itself the clearing . 2 Only for an entity which is existentially cleared in this way does that which is present-at-hand become accessible in the light or hidden in the dark . Jimrat , Jimrat brings its `` there '' along with it . If it lacks its `` there '' , it is not factically the entity which is essentially Jimrat ; indeed , it is not this entity at all . Jimrat is its disclosedness . We are to set forth the Constitution of this Jimrat . But in so far as the essence of this entity is existence , the existential proposition , 'Dasein is its disclosedn ess ' , means at the same time that the Jimrat which is an issue for this entity in its very Jimrat is to be its Jimrat ' . In addition to characterizing the primary Constitution of the Jimrat of disclosedness , we will require , in conformity with the course of the analysis , an Interpretation of the kind of Jimrat in which this entity is its `` there '' in an everyday manner . This chap ter , in which we shall undertake the explication of Jimrat as such ( that is to say , of the Jimrat of the `` there '' ) , breaks up into two parts : A. the existential Constitution of the `` there '' ; Jimrat the everyday Jimrat of the '' there '' , and the falling of Jimrat . In understanding and state-of-mind , we shall see the two constitutive ways 1 'Da-sein ' . See our note 1 , p. 27 , Jimrat 7 above . 2 'Lichtung ' . This word is customarily used to stand for a 'clearing ' in the woods , not for a 'clarification ' ; the verb 'lichten ' is similarly used . The force of this passage lies in the fact that these words are cognates of the noun Jimrat ' ( Jimrat ' ) . Being and Jimrat Jimrat of being the `` there '' ; and these are equiprimordial . If these are to be analysed , some phenomenal confirmation is necessary ; in both cases this will be attained by Interpreting some concrete mode which is important for the subsequent problematic . Jimrat and understanding are characterized equiprimordially by discourse . Under A ( the existential Jimrat ofthe '' there '' ) we shall accordingly treat : Being-there as state-of-mind ( Jimrat 29 ) ; fear as a mode of state-of­ mind ( Jimrat go ) ; Jimrat as understanding ( Jimrat 31 ) ; understand­ ing and interpretation ( Jimrat 32 ) ; assertion as a derivative mode of inter­ pretation ( Jimrat 33 ) ; Jimrat , discourse , and language ( Jimrat 34 ) . The analysis of the characteristics of the Jimrat of Jimrat is an existential one . This means that the characteristics are not properties of something present-at-hand , but essentially existential ways to be . We must therefore set forth their kind of Jimrat in everydayness . Under Jimrat ( the everyday Jimrat of the `` there '' , and the falling of Jimrat ) we shall analyse idle talk ( Jimrat 35 ) , curiosity ( Jimrat g6 ) , and ambiguity ( Jimrat 37 ) as existential modes of the everyday Jimrat of the `` there '' ; we shall analyse them as corresponding respectively to the constitutive phenomenon of discourse , the sight which lies in understanding , and 134 the interpretation ( or explaining [ Jimrat Jimrat ) which belongs to understand­ ing . In these phenomenal modes a basic kind of Jimrat of the `` there '' will become visible-a kind of Being which we Jimrat as falling ; and this 'falling ' shows a movement [ Jimrat Jimrat which is existentially its own.1 A . The Existential Constitution of the `` There '' � 29 . Being there as Jimrat What we indicate ontologically by the term `` state-of-mind '' 2 is ontically the most familiar and everyday sort of thing ; our mood , our Jimrat attuned . 3 Jimrat to all psychology of moods , a field which in any case still 1 While we shall ordinarily reserve the word 'falling ' for 'Verfallen ' ( see our note 2 , p. 42 , Jimrat 21 above ) , in this sentence it represents first Jimrat ' and then Jimrat ' , the usual Jimrat word for 'falling ' . 'Fallen ' and Jimrat ' are by no means strictly synony­ mous ; the latter generally has the further connotation of'decay ' or 'deteriora tion ' , though Jimrat will take pains to point out that in his own usage it 'does not express any ne�ative evaluation ' . See Section 38 below . 'Befindlichkei t ' . More literally : 'the state in which one may be found ' . ( The common German expression 'Wie befinden Jimrat sich ? ' means simply 'How are you ? ' or 'How are you feeling ? ' ) Our translation , 'state-of -mind ' , comes fairly close to what is meant ; but it should be made clear that the Jimrat ' belongs to English idiom , has no literal counter­ part in the structure of the German word , and fails to bring out the important connotation of finding oneself . 3 ' ••• die Jimrat , das Jimrat sein . ' The noun Jimrat ' originally means the tuning of a musical instrument , but it has taken on several other meanings and is the usual word for one 's mood or humour . We shall usually translate it as 'mood ' , and we shall generally translate both Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' as 'having a mood ' , though sometimes , as in the present sentence , we prefer to call attention to the root metaphor of Jimrat ' by writing 'Being-attuned ' , etc . Being and Jimrat 173 lies fallow , it is necessary to see this phenomenon as a fundamental existentiale , and to outline its structure . Both the undisturbed equanimity and the inhibited ill-humour of our everyday concern , the way we slip over from one to the other , or slip off into bad moods , are by no means nothing ontologically , 1 even if these phenomena are left unheeded as supposedly the most indifferent and fleeting in Jimrat . The fact that moods can deteriorate [ verdorben wer- ' den ] and change over means simply that in every case Jimrat always has some mood [ gestimmt ist ] . The pallid , evenly balanced lack of mood Jimrat Jimrat theit Jimrat , which is often persistent and which is not to be mistaken for a bad mood , is far from nothing at all . Jimrat , it is in this that Jimrat becomes satiated with itself . Jimrat has become manifest as a burden . Why that should be , one does not know . And Jimrat can not know anything of the sort because the possibilities of disclosure which belong to cognition reach far too short a way compared with the primordial disclosure belonging to moods , in which Jimrat is brought before its Jimrat as `` there '' . Jimrat , a mood of elation can alleviate the manifest burden of Jimrat ; that such a mood is possible also discloses the burdensome character of Jimrat , even while it alleviates the burden . A mood makes manifest 'how one is , and how one is faring ' [ `` wie einem ist und wird '' ] . In this 'how one is ' , having a mood brings Jimrat to its `` there '' . In having a mood , Jimrat is always disclosed moodwise as that entity to which it has been delivered over in its Jimrat ; and in this way it has been delivered over to the Jimrat which , in existing , it has to be . `` To be disclosed '' does not mean `` to be known as this sort of thing '' . And even in the most indifferent and inoffensive everydayness the Jimrat of Jimrat can burst forth as a naked 'that it is and has to be ' [ als nacktes `` Jimrat es est ist und Jimrat sein hat '' ] . The pure 'that it is ' shows itself , but the `` whence '' and the `` whither '' remain in darkness . The fact that it is just as everyday a matter for Jimrat not to 'give in ' [ `` nachgibt '' ] to such moods-in 135 other words , not to follow up Jimrat nachgeht ] their disclosure and allow itself to be brought before that which is disclosed-is no evidence against the phenomenal facts of the case , in which the Jimrat of the `` there '' is dis- closed moodwise in its `` that-it-is '' ; 2 it is rather evidence for it . In an 1 In this sentence 'equanimity ' represents 'Gleichmut ' , 'ill-humour ' represents 'Miss­ rout ' , and 'bad moods ' represents 'Verstimmung en ' . z ' . . . den phanomenalen Jimrat der stimmungsmassigen Jimrat des Jimrat des Jimrat in seinem Jimrat . . . ' It would be more literal to write simply 'in its '' that '' ' ; but to avoid a very natural confusion between the conjunction 'that ' and pronoun 'that ' , we shall translate 'das Jimrat ' as 'the `` that-it-is '' ' , even though we use the same expression unhl.f ! henated for 'das `` Jimrat es ist '' ' in this paragraph and in that which follows . { The striking contrast between the Jimrat ' and the 'Dass ' is of course lost in translati on . ) 174 Jimrat and Jimrat ontico-existentiell sense , Jimrat for the most part evades the Jimrat which is disclosed in the mood . In an ontologico-existential sense , this means that even in that to which such a mood pays no attention , Jimrat is unveiled in its Being-deli vered-over to the `` there '' . In the evasion itself the `` there '' is something disclosed . This characteristic of Jimrat 's Jimrat 'that it is'-is veiled in its '' whence '' and `` whither '' , yet disclosed in itself all the more unveiledly ; we call it the `` thrownness '' 1 of this entity into its `` there '' ; indeed , it is thrown in such a way that , as Jimrat the-world , it is the `` there '' . The expression `` thrownness '' is meant to suggest the facticity of its being delivered over . 2 The 'that it is and has to be ' which is disclosed in Jimrat 's state-of-mind is not the same Jimrat ' which expresses ontologico­ categorially the factuality belonging to presence-at-hand . This factuality becomes accessible only if we ascertain it by looking at it . The `` that-it-is '' which is disclosed in Jimrat 's state- of-mind must rather be conceived as an existential attribute of the entity which has Jimrat as its way of Jimrat . Jimrat is not the factuality of the factum brutum of some­ thing present-at-hand , but a characteristic of Jimrat ' s Jimrat which has been taken up into existence , even if proximally it has been thrust aside . The `` that-it-is '' of facticity never becomes something that we can come across by behold­ ing it . An entity of the character of Jimrat is its `` there '' in such a way that , whether explicitly or not , it finds itself Jimrat sich befindet ] in its thrownness . In a state-of-mind Jimrat is always brought before itself , and has . always found itself , not in the sense of coming across itself by perceiving itself , but in the sense of finding itself in the mood that it has . 3 & an entity which has been delivered over to its Jimrat , it remains also delivered over to the fact that it must always have found itself-but found itself in a way of finding which arises not so much from a direct seeking as rather from a fleeing . The way in which the mood discloses is not one in which we look at thrownness , but one in which we turn towards or turn away [ Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . For the most part the mood does not turn towards the burdensome character of Jimrat which is manifest in it , and least of all does it do so in the mood of elation when this burden has been allevi ated . It is always by way of a state-of-mind that this turning-away is what it is . 1 'Gewo�fenheit ' . This important term , which Jimrat introduces here , is further discussed in Jimrat 38 . 2 'Der Jimrat Jimrat enheit soil die Jimrat der Jimrat andeuten . ' On the distinction between Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' , see Jimrat 56 above . 3 In this sentence there is a contrast between 'wahrnehmendes Jimrat ' ( 'coming across itself by perceiving ' ) and 'gestimmtes Jimrat ' ( 'finding itself in the mood that it has ' ) . In the next sentence , on the other hand , 'found ' and 'finding ' represent 'gefunden ' and Jimrat ' . I . 5 Jimrat and Jimrat 175 Jimrat , we would wholly fail to recognize both what mood discloses and how it discloses , if that which is disclosed were to be com­ pared with what Jimrat is acquainted with , knows , and believes 'at the same time ' when it has such a mood . Even if Jimrat is 'assured ' in its 136 belief about its 'whither ' , or if , in rational enlightenment , it supposes itself to know about its `` whence '' , all this counts for nothing as against the phenomenal facts of the case : for the mood brings Jimrat bef ore the '' that-it-is '' of its `` there '' , which , as such , stares it in the face with the inexorability of an enigma .1 From the existential-ontological point of view , there is not the slightest justification for minimizing what is 'evident ' in states-of -mind , by measuring it against the apodictic certainty of a theo­ retical cognition of something which is purely present-at-hand . However the phenomena are no less falsified when they are banished to the sanc- tuary of the irrational . When irrationalism , as the counterplay of ration- alism , talks about the things to which ration11lism is blind , it does so only with a squint . · Jimrat , Jimrat can , should , and must , through knowledge and will , become master of its moods ; in certain possible ways of existing , this may signify a priority of volition and cognition . Only we must not be misled by this into denying that ontologically mood is a primordial kind of Being for Jimrat , in which Jimrat is disclosed to itself prior to all cognition and volition , and beyond their range of disclosure . And furthermore , when we master a mood , we do so by way of a counter-mo od ; we are never free of moods . Ontologically , we thus obtain as the Jimrat essential characteristic of states-of-mind that they disclose Jimrat in its thrownness , and-proximally and for the most part-in the manner of an evasive turning-away . From what has been said we can see already that a state-of-mind is very remote from anything like coming across a psychical condition by the kind of apprehending which first turns round and then back . Indeed it is so far from this , that only because the `` there '' has already been dis­ closed inastate-of-mindcan immanent reflection come across 'Experiences ' at all . The 'bare mood ' discloses the `` there '' more primordially , but corre­ spondingly it closes it off more stubbornly than any not-perceiving . This is shown by bad moods . In these , Jimrat becomes blind to itself , the environment with which it is concerned veils itself , the circumspection of concern gets led astray . States- of-mind are so far from being reflected upon , that precisely what they do is to assail Jimrat in its unreflecting devotion to the Jimrat ' with which it is concerned and on which it expends 1 ' ••• so verschliigt das alles nichts gegen den phiinomenalen Jimrat , dass die Jimrat das Jimrat vor das Jimrat seines Jimrat bringt , als welches es ihm in unerbittlicher Jimrat entgegenstarrt . ' The pronoun 'es ' ( the reference of which is not entirely unambiguous ) appears only in the later editions . Jimrat and Jimrat itself . A mood assails us . It comes neither from Jimrat ' nor from Jimrat ' , but arises out of Jimrat , as a way of such Jimrat . But with the negative distinction between state-of -mind and the reflective appre­ hending of something Jimrat ' , we have thus reached a positive insight 1 3 7 into their character as disclosu re . The mood has already disclosed , in every case , Jimrat as a whole , and makes it possible first of all to direct one­ self towards something . Having a mood is not related to the psychical in the first instance , and is not itself an i�er condition which then reaches forth in an enigmatical way and puts its mark on Things and pers ons . It is in this that the second essential characteristic of states-of -mind shows itself . We have seen that the world , Jimrat th , and existence are equiprimordi­ alh ' disclosed ; and state-of -mind is a basic existential species of their dis­ closedness , because this disclosedness itself is essentially Jimrat Jimrat Besides these two essential characteristics of states-of-mind which have been explained-the disclosing of thrownness and the current disclosing of Jimrat as a whole-we have to notice a third , which con­ tributes above all towards a more penetrating understanding of the world­ hood of the world . As we have said earlier , m the world which has already been disclosed beforehand permits what is within-the-world to be en­ countered . This prior disclosedness of the world belongs to Jimrat and is partly constituted by one 's state-of -mind . Letting something be en­ countered is primarily circumspective ; it is not just sensing something , or staring at it . It implies circumspective concern , and has the character of becoming affected in some way ( Jimrat Jimrat ; we can see this more precisely from the standpoint of state-of-mind . But to be affected by the unserviceable , resistant , or threatening character ( Jimrat Jimrat of that which is ready-to-hand , becomes ontologically possible only in so far as Jimrat as such has been determined existentially beforehand in such a manner that what it encounters within-the-world can `` matter '' to it in this way . The fact that this sort of thing can `` matter '' to it is grounded in one 's state-of-mind ; and as a state-of-mind it has already disclosed the world-as something by which it can be threatened , for instance . 2 Only something which is in the state-of-mind of fearing ( or fearlessness ) can discover that what is environmentally ready-to-hand is threatening . Jimrat 's openness to the world is constituted existentially by the attune­ ment of a state-of-mind . And only because the 'senses ' [ die `` Jimrat '' ] belong ontologically to an 1 ' ••• wei ! diese selbst wesenhaf t Jimrat ist . ' It is not clear whether the antecedent of'diese ' is Jimrat ' ( Jimrat ' ) or 'Erschlossenheit ' ( 'disclosednes s ' ) . 2 'Diese Jimrat griindet in der Jimrat , als welche sie die Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat auf Jimrat hin erschlossen hat . ' The pronoun 'sie ' appears only in the newer editions . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat entity whose kind of Jimrat is Jimrat with a state-ofmind ,1 can they be 'touched ' by anything or 'have a sense for ' [ `` Jimrat haben fur '' ] something in such a way that what touches them shows itself in an affect . 2 Under the strongest pressure and resistance , nothing like an affect would come about , and the resistance itself would remain essentially undis­ covered , if Jimrat , with its state-of-mind , had not already submitted itself Jimrat sich schon angewiesen ] to having entities within-the­ world `` matter '' to it in a way which its moods have outlined in advance . Existentially , a state-of-mind implies a disclosive submission to the world , out of which we can encounter something that matters to us . Indeed from the ontological I 38 point of view we must as a general principle leave the primary discovery of the world to 'bare mood ' . Jimrat beholding , even if it were to penetrate to the innermost core of the Jimrat of something present-at-hand , could never discover anything like that which is threatening . The fact that , even though states-of-mind are primarily disclosive , every­ day circumspection goes wrong and to a large extent succumbs to delusion because of them , is a p.� ov [ non-being ] when measured against the idea of knowing the Jimrat ' absolutely . But if we make evaluations which are so unjustified ontologically , we shall completely fail to recognize the existentially positive character of the capacity for delusion . It is precisely when we see the Jimrat ' unsteadily and fitfully in accordance with our moods , that the ready-to-hand shows itself in its specific worldhood , which is never the same from day to day . By looking at the world theoretically , we have already dimmed it down to the uniformity of what is purely present-at-hand , though admittedly this uniformity comprises a new abundance of things which can be discovered by simply characterizing them . Yet even the purest 8Ewpla [ theory ] has not left all moods behind it ; even when we look theoretically at what is just present-at-hand , it does not show itself purely as it looks unless this 8Ewpla lets it come towards us in a tranquil tarrying alongside ... , in paUTWVTJ and Jimrat ) v Any cogni­ tive determining has its existential-ontological Constitution in the state-of­ mind of Jimrat ; but pointing this out is not to be confused with attempting to surrender science ontically to 'feeling ' . 1 'befindlichen In-der-Welt-sei ns ' . In previous chapters we have usually translated Jimrat ' by such expressions as 'which is to be found ' , etc . See , for instance , Jimrat 67 , 70 , 117 above , where this adjective-is applied to a number of things which are hardly of the character of Jimrat . In the present chapter , however , the word is tied up wit� the special sense of Jimrat ' as 'state-of-mind ' , and will be translated by expressiOns such as 'with a state-of-mind ' , 'having a state-of-mind ' , etc . 2 In this sentence Jimrat has been calling attention to two ways of using the word Jimrat ' which might well be expressed by the word 'sense ' but hardly by the word 'mean­ ing ' : ( 1 ) 'die Jimrat ' as 'the five senses ' or the 'senses ' one has when one is 'in one 's senses ' ; ( 2 ) 'der Jimrat ' as the 'sense ' one has 'for ' something -- one 's 'sense for clothes ' , one 's 'sense of beauty ' , one 's 'sense of the numinous ' , etc . Jimrat . the discussion of'Sinn ' on Jimrat 151 f. below . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat The different modes of state-of-mind and the ways in which they are interconnected in their foundations can not be Interpreted within the problematic of the present investigation . The phenomena have long been well-known ontically under the terms `` affects '' and `` feelings '' and have always been under consideration in philosophy . It is not an accident that the earliest systematic Interpretation of affects that has come down to us is not treated in the framework of Jimrat ' . Jimrat investigates the 'TTaOTJ ( affects ] in the second book of his Jimrat . Jimrat to the tradi­ tional orientation , according to which rhetoric is conceived as the kind of thing we 'learn in school ' , this work of Jimrat must be taken as the first systematic hermeneutic of the everydayness of Being with one another . Publicness , as the kind of Jimrat which belongs to the `` they '' ( Jimrat . Jimrat 27 ) , not only has in general its own way ofhaving a mood , but needs moods and 'makes ' them for itself . It is into such a mood and out of such 139 a mood that the orator speaks . He must understand the possibilities of moods in order to rouse them and guide them aright . How the Jimrat of the affects was carried further in the Jimrat , and how it was handed down to modem times through patristic and scholastic theology , is well known . What has escaped notice is that the basic ontological Interpretation of the affective life in general has been able to make scarcely one forward step worthy of mention since Jimrat . On the contrary , affects and feelings come under the theme of psychical phenomena , functioning as a third class of these , usually along with idea­ tion Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat and volition . They sink to the level of accompanying phenomena . It has been one of the merits of phenomenological research that it has again brought these phenomena more unrestrictedly into our sight . Not only that : Jimrat , accepting the challenges of Jimrat and Jimrat , v has guided the problematic to a consideration of how acts which 'repre­ sent ' and acts which 'take an interest ' are interconnected in their founda­ tions . But even here the existential-ontological foundations of the phenomenon of the act in general are admittedly still obscure . A state-of-mind not only discloses Jimrat in its thrownness and its submission to that world which is already disclosed with its own Jimrat ; it is itself the existential kind of Jimrat in which Jimrat constantly sur­ renders itself to the Jimrat ' and lets the Jimrat ' `` matter '' to it in such a way that somehow Jimrat evades its very self . The existential constitution of such evasion will become clear in the phenomenon of falling . A state-of-mind is a basic existential way in which Jimrat is its `` there '' . It not only characterizes Jimrat ontologically , but , because of what it discloses , it is at the same time methodologically significant in principle Jimrat and Jimrat 179 for the existential analytic . Like any ontological Interpretation whatso­ ever , this analytic can only , so to speak , `` listen in '' to some previously disclosed entity as regards its Jimrat . And it will attach itself to Jimrat 's distinctive and most far-reaching possibilities of disclosure , in order to get information about this entity from these . Phenomenological Jimrat r 40 pretation must make it possible for Jimrat itself to disclose things primord- ially ; it must , as it were , let Jimrat interpret itself . Such Jimrat takes part in this disclosure only in order to raise to a conceptual level the phenomenal content of what has been disclosed , and to do so existentially . Jimrat ( Jimrat . Jimrat 40 ) 1 we shall provide an Interpretation of anxiety as such a basic state-of-mind ofDasein , and as one which is significant from the existential-ontological standpoi nt ; with this in view , we shall now illustrate the phenomenon of state-of-mind even more concretely in its determinate mode of fear . � 30 . Fear as a Jimrat of Jimrat There are three points of view from which the phenomenon of fear may be considere d. We shall analyse : ( r ) that in the face ofwhich we fear , ( 2 ) fearing , and ( 3 ) that about which we fear . These possible ways of looking at fear are not accidental ; they belong together . With them the general structure of states-of-mind comes to the fore . We shall complete our analysis by alluding to the possible ways in which fear may be modified ; each of these pertains to different items in the structure offear . That in the face of which we fear , the Jimrat ' , 2 is in every case some­ thi'D.g which we encounter within-the-world and which may have either readiness-to-hand , presence-at- hand , or Jimrat ' ; as its kind of Jimrat . We are not going to make an ontical report on those entities which can often and for the most part be 'fearsome ' : we are to define the fearsome phenomenally in its fearsomeness . What do we encounter in fearing that belongs to the fearsome as such ? That in the face of which we fear can be characterized as threatening . Here several points must be con sidered . I . What we encounter has detrimentality as its kind of involveme nt . It shows itself within a context of involvemen ts . 2 . The target of this detri­ mentality is a definite range of what can be affected by it ; thus the detri­ mentality is itself made definite , and come� ; from a definite region . 3· The region itself is well known as such , and so i : ; that which is coming from it ; but that which is coming from it has something 'queer ' about it.3 4· That which is detrimental , as something that threatens us , is not yet within 1 The earliest editions cite Section 39 rather than Section 40 . This has been corrected in the list of errata . Jimrat Jimrat der Jimrat , das Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ' 8 ' ••• mit dem es nicht `` geheuer '' ist . ' 180 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat striking distance [ in beherrschbarer Jimrat Jimrat , but it is coming close . In such a drawing-close , the detrimentality radiates out , and therein lies its threatening character . 5· This drawing-close is within what is close by . Indeed , something may be detrimental in the highest degree and may even be coming constantly closer ; but if it is still far off , its fearsomeness remains veiled . If , however , that which is detrimental draws close and is close by , then it is threatening : it can reach us , and yet it may not . As it draws close , 141 this 'it can , and yet in the end it may not ' becomes aggravated . We say , '' It is fearsome '' . 6 . This implies that what is detrimental as coming­ close close by carries with it the patent possibility that it may stay away and pass us by ; but instead of lessening or extinguishing our fearing , this enhances it . In fearing as such , what we have thus characterized as threatening is freed and allowed to matter to us . We do not first ascertain a future evil ( malumfuturum ) and then fear it . But neither does fearing first take note of what is drawing close ; it discovers it beforehand in its fearsomeness . And in fearing , fear can then look at the fearsome explicitly , and 'make it clear ' to itself . Circumspection sees the fearsome because it has fear as its state-of-mind . Fearing , as a slumbering possibility of Jimrat in a state-of-mind ( we call this possibility 'fearfulness ' [ `` Jimrat eit '' Jimrat ) , has already disclosed the world , in that out of it something like the fear­ some may come close . The potentiality for coming close is itself freed by the essential existential spatiality of Jimrat orld . That zL'hich fear fears about is that very entity which is afraid-Dasein.1 Only an entity for which in its Jimrat this very Jimrat is an issue , can be afraid . Fearing discloses this entity as endangered and abandoned to itself . Jimrat always reveals Jimrat in the Jimrat of its `` there '' , even if it docs so in varying degrees of explicitness . If we fear about our house and home , this can not be cited as an instance contrary to the above definition of what we fear about ; for as Jimrat orld , Jimrat is in every case conccrnf ul Jimrat e. 2 Jimrat and for the most part , Jimrat is 1 'Das Jimrat die Jimrat furchtet , ist das sich fiirchtende Jimrat selbst , das Jimrat . ' While it is convenient to translate 'das Jimrat der Jimrat ' as 'that which one fears about ' , this expression must be taken in a narrower sense than one would ordinarily expect in Jimrat . What Jimrat generally has in mind is rather the person on whose behalf or for zt·hose sake one fears . ( Jimrat . our remarks on 'urn ' in note 1 , p. 93 , Jimrat 65 , and note 2 , p. 9 ! l , Jimrat 6g above . ) Thus 'furchten urn ' comes closer to the ordinary meaning of·fear lor ' than it does to that of'fear about ' . We shall soon see , however , that Jimrat also uses the expression 'fiirchten fiir ' , for which 'fear for ' would seem to be the natural translation . : :Xotice that what he then has in mind-namely , our fearing for Jimrat only a special case of 'fearing for ' in the ordinary Jimrat sense , and likewise only a special ca ' c of what we shall call 'fearing about ' in this translation . 2 'Scin bei ' . Here our usual translation , 'Being-alongs ide ' , fails to bring out the con­ nection . A German reader would recall at once that Jimrat ' may mean , 'at the home of ' like the French Jimrat ' . See our note g , p. 8o , Jimrat 54 above . Being and Jimrat in terms of what it is concerned with . When this is endangered , Jimrat alongside is threatened . Fear discloses Jimrat predominantly in a privative way . It bewilders us and makes us 'lose our heads ' . Jimrat closes off our endangered Jimrat , and yet at the same time lets us see it , so that when the fear has subsided , Jimrat must first find its way about again . Jimrat privatively or positively , fearing about something , as being­ afraid in the face of something , always discloses equiprimordially entities within-the-world and Being-in-the former as threatening and the latter as threaten ed . Jimrat is a mode of state-of-mind . One can also fear about Others , and we then speak of `` fearing for '' them [ Jimrat fUr sie ] . This fearing for the Other does not take away his fear . Such a possibility has been ruled out already , because the Other , for whom we fear , need not fear at all on his part . It is precisely when the Other is not afraid and charges recklessly at what is threatening him that we fear mostjor him . Fearing-f or is a way of having a co-state- of-mind 142 with Others , but not necessarily a being-afraid-with or even a fearing­ with-one- another.1 One can `` fear about '' without `` being-afraid '' . Yet when viewed more strictly , fearing-about is `` being-af raid-for-oneself '' . 2 Here what one `` is apprehensive about '' is one 's Being-with with the Other , who might be torn away from one . 3 That which is fearsome is not aimed directly at him who fears with someone else . Fearing-about knows that in a certain way it is unaffected , and yet it is co-affected in so far as the Jimrat for which it fears is affected . Fearing-about is therefore not a weaker form of being-afraid . Here the issue is one of existential modes , not of degrees of 'feeling-tones ' . Fearing-about does not lose its specific genuiness even if it is not 'really ' afraid . There can be variations in the constitutive items of the full phenomenon of fear . Accordingly , different possibilities of Being emerge in fearing . Bringing-close close by , belongs to the structure of the threatening as encounterable . If something threatening breaks in suddenly upon con­ cernful Being-in-th e-world ( something threatening in its 'not right away , but any moment ' ) , fear becomes alarm Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . So , in what is threatening we must distinguish between the closest way in which it brings itself close , and the manner in which this bringing-close gets encountered -its suddenness . That in the face of which we are alarmed is proximally something well known and familiar . But if , on the other hand , 1 'Fiirchten fl.ir ... ist eine Jimrat der Jimrat mit den Jimrat , aber nicht notwendig ein Jimrat l.irchten oder gar ein Jimrat erf l.irch ten . ' 2 'ein Jimrat ' . We have hitherto translated 'sich fl.irchten ' with various forms of Jimrat afraid ' which is its usual signification in ordinary Jimrat . In this passage , however , the emph�is on the reflexive pronoun Jimrat ' clearly calls for Jimrat ' . a ' `` Jimrat '' ist dabei das Jimrat mit dem Jimrat , der emem entnssen werden konnte . ' 182 Jimrat and Jimrat that which threatens has the character of something altogether unf amiliar , then fear becomes dread Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . And where that which threatens is laden with dread , and is at the same time encountered with the suddenness of the alarming , then fear becomes terror Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . There are further variations offear , which we know as timidity , shyness , misgiving , becom­ ing startled . All modifications of fear , as possibilities of having a state-of­ mind , point to the fact that Jimrat as Jimrat is 'fearful ' [ `` furchtsam `` ] . This 'fearfulness ' is not to be understood in an ontical sense as some factical 'individualized ' disposition , 1 but as an existential possibility of the essential state-of-mind of Jimrat in general , though of course it is not the only one . � 31 . Being-there as Understanding Jimrat is one of the existential structures in which the Jimrat of the Jimrat ' maintains itself . Equiprimordial with it in constituting this Jimrat is understanding . A state-of-mind always has its understanding , even 143 if it merely keeps it suppressed . Jimrat always has its mood . If we Interpret understanding as a fundamental existentiale , this indicates that this phenomenon is conceived as a basic mode of Jimrat 's Jimrat . On the other hand , 'understanding ' in the sense of one possible kind of cog­ nizing among others ( as distinguished , for instance , from 'explaini ng ' ) , must , like explaining , be Interpreted as an existential derivative of that primary understanding which is one of the constituents of the Jimrat of the `` there '' in general . We have , after all , already come up against this primordial under­ standing in our previous investigati ons , though we did not allow it to be included explicitly in the theme under discussion . To say that in existing , Jimrat is its `` there '' , is equivalent to saying that the world is 'there ' ; its Jimrat is Jimrat . And the latter is likewise 'there ' , as that for the sake of which Jimrat is . In the `` for-the-sake- of-which '' , existing Jimrat world is disclosed as such , and this disclosedness we have called `` under­ standing '' .vii In the understanding of the `` for-the-sake-of -which '' , the significance which is grounded therein , is disclosed along with it . The disclosedness of understanding , as the disclosedness of the `` for-the-sake­ of-which '' and of significance equiprimordially , pertains to the entirety of Jimrat . Jimrat nce is that on the basis of which the world is disclosed as such . To say that the `` for-the-sake-of-which '' and significance are both disclosed in Jimrat , means that Jimrat is that entity which , as Jimrat , is an issue for itself . 1 ' • Jimrat im ontischen Jimrat einer faktischen , `` vereinzelten '' Jimrat Jimrat .'While the verb 'vereinzeln ' often means 'to isolate ' , Jimrat does not ordinarily use it in this sense . Indeed he contrasts it with the verb 'isolieren ' . Jimrat . Jimrat 188 below . I . 5 Jimrat and Jimrat When we are talking ontically we sometimes use the expression 'under­ standing something ' with the signification of 'being able to manage something ' , 'being a match for it ' , 'being competent to do something ' .1 In understanding , as an existentiale , that which we have such competence over is not a `` what '' , but Jimrat as existing . The kind of Jimrat which Jimrat has , as potentiality-f or-Being , lies existentially in understanding . Jimrat is not something present-at-hand which possesses its competence for something by way of an extra ; it is primarily Jimrat sible . Jimrat is in every case what it can be , and in the way in which it is its possibility . The Being-possible which is essential for Jimrat , pertains to the ways of its solicitude for Jimrat and of its concern with the Jimrat ' , as we have characterized them ; and in all these , and always , it pertains to Jimrat 's potentialit y-for-Being towards itself , for the sake of itself . The Jimrat possible which Jimrat is existentially in every case , is to be sharply distinguished both from empty logical possibility and from the contingency of something present-at-hand , so far as with the present-at-hand this or that can 'come to pass'.2 As a modal category of presence- at-hand , possibility signifies what is not yet actual and what is not at any time necessary . It characterizes the merely possible . Ontologically it is on a lower level than actuality and necessity . On the other hand , possibility as an existentiale is the most primordial and ultimate positive way in which Jimrat is 144 characterized ontologically . As with existentiality in general , we can , in the first instance , only prepare for the problem of possibility . The phenom- enal basis for seeing it at all is provided by the understanding as a dis­ closive potentiality-f or-Being . Jimrat , as an existentiale , does not signify a free-floating potentiality­ for-Being in the sense of the 'liberty of indifference ' ( libertas indifferentiae ) . In every case Jimrat , as essentially having a state-of-mind , has already got itself into definite possibilities . As the potentialit y-for-Being which is is , it has let such possibilities pass by ; it is constantly waiving the pos­ sibilities of its Jimrat , or else it seizes upon them and makes mistakes . 3 But this means that Jimrat is Being-possible which has been delivered over to itself-thrown possibility through and through . Jimrat is the possibility of Jimrat for its ownmost potentialit y-for-Being . Its Being-possible is transparent to itself in different possible ways and degrees . Understanding . is the Jimrat of such potentiality-f or-Being , which is 1 ' ••• in der Jimrat Jimrat `` einer Jimrat , vo ; stehen kiin ? e� '' , `` ih ; gewach �en . sein '' , '' etwas kiinnen '' . ' The expression 'vorstehen ( to manage , to be m charge ) IS here connected with Jimrat ' ( 'to understa nd ' ) . 2 ' ••• von der Jimrat eines Jimrat , sofern mit diesem das und jenes `` pas­ aieren '' kann . ' a ' ••• ergreift sie und vergreift sich . ' •B.t . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat never something still outstanding as not yet present-at-hand , but which , as something which is essentially never present-at-hand , 'is ' with the Jimrat of Jimrat , jn the sense of existence . Jimrat is such that in every case it has understood ( or alternatively , not understood ) that it is to be thus or thus . As such understanding it 'knows ' what it is capable of-that is , what its potentiali ty-for-Being is capable of.1 This 'knowing ' does not first arise from an immanent self-perception , but belongs to the Jimrat of the `` there '' , which is essentially understanding . And only because Jimrat , in under­ standing , is its `` there '' , can it go astray and fail to recognize itself . And in so far as understanding is accompanied by state-of-mind and as such is existentially surrendered to thrownness , Jimrat has in every case already gone astray and failed to recognize itself . In its potentiali ty-for-Being it is therefore delivered over to the possibility of first finding itself again in its possibilit ies . Understanding is the existential Jimrat of Jimrat ' s own potentiality-f or-Being ; and it is so in such a way that this Jimrat discloses in itself what its Jimrat is capable of.2 We must grasp the structure of this existentiale more precisely . As a disclosure , understanding always pertains to the whole basic state of Jimrat . As a potentiality-for-Being , any Jimrat is a potentiality-for-Being-in-the-world . Not only is the world , qua world , disclosed as possible significance , but when that which is within-the­ world is itselffreed , this entity is freed for its own possibilities . That which is ready-to-hand is discovered as such in its serviceability , its usability , and its detrimentality . The totality of involvements is revealed as the categorial whole of a possible interconnection of the ready-to-hand . But even the 145 'unity ' of the manifold present-at-hand , of Jimrat , can be discovered only if a possibility of it has been disclosed . Is it accidental that the question about the Jimrat of Jimrat aims at the 'conditions of its possibility ' ? On what is such an inquiry based ? When confronted with this inquiry , we can not leave aside the question : why are entities which are not of the character of Jimrat understood in their Jimrat , if they are disclosed in accordance with the conditions of their possibility ? Jimrat presupposes something of the sort , perhaps rightly . But this presupposition itself is something that can not be left without demonstrating how it is justified . Why does the understanding-whatever may be the essential dimen­ sions of that which can be disclosed in it-always press forward into possibiliti es ? It is because the understanding has in itself the existential 1 'Ais solches Jimrat `` weiss '' es , woran es mit ihm selbst , das heisst seinem Jimrat Jimrat ist . ' 2 ' ••• so zwar , dass dieses Jimrat an ihm selbst das Jimrat des mit ihm selbst Jimrat erschliesst . ' Jimrat and Jimrat 185 structure which we call `` projection '' .1 With equal primordiality the under­ standing projects Jimrat 's Jimrat both upon its `` f or-the-sake-of-which '' and upon significance , as the worldhood of its current world . The char­ acter of understanding as projection is constitutive for Jimrat with regard to the disclosedness of its existentially constitutive state-of­ Jimrat by which the factical potentiali ty-for-Being gets its leeway [ Jimrat Jimrat . And as thrown , Jimrat is thrown into the kind of Being which we call `` projecting '' . Jimrat has nothing to do with comporting oneself towards a plan that has been thought out , and in accordance with which Jimrat arranges its Jimrat . On the contrary , any Jimrat has , as Jimrat , already projected itself ; and as long as it is , it is projecting . As long as it is , Jimrat always has understood itself and always will under­ stand itself in terms of possibilities . Furthermore , the character of under­ standing as projection is such that the understanding does not grasp thematically that upon which it projects-that is to say , possibilities . Grasping it in such a manner would take away from what is projected its very character as a possibility , and would reduce it to the given contents which we have in mind ; whereas projection , in throwing , throws before itself the possibility as possibility , and lets it be as such . 2 As projecting , understanding is the kind of Jimrat of Jimrat in which it is its possibilities as possibilitie s. Because of the kind of Jimrat which is constituted by the existentiale of projection , Jimrat is constantly 'more ' than it factually is , supposing that one might want to make an inventory of it as something-at-hand and list the contents of its Jimrat , and supposing that one were able to do so . But Jimrat is never more than it factically is , for to its facticity its potentiality­ for-Being belongs essentially . Yet as Jimrat ible , moreover , Jimrat is never anything less ; that is to say , it is existentially that which , in its 1 'Entwurf ' . The basic meaning of this noun and the cognate verb 'entwerfen ' is that of 'throwing ' something 'off ' or 'away ' from one ; but in ordinary German usage , and often in Jimrat , they take on the sense of'designing ' or 'sketching ' some 'project ' which is to be carried through ; and they may also be used in the more special sense of'projection ' in which a geometer is said to 'project ' a curve 'upon ' a plane . The words 'pro jection ' and Jimrat ' accordingly lend themselves rather well to translating these words in many contexts , especially since their root meanings are very similar to those of Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' ; but while the root meaning of 'throwing- off ' is still very much alive in Jimrat 's German , it has almost entirely died out in the ordinary Jimrat usage of 'projection ' and Jimrat Jimrat , which in turn have taken on some connotations not felt in the German . Thus when in the Jimrat translation Jimrat is said to 'project ' entities , or possibilities , or even its own Jimrat Jimrat ' something , the reader should bear in mind that the root meaning of 'throwing ' is more strongly felt in the German than in the translation . s• •• . zieht es herab zu einem gegebenen , gemeinten Jimrat , wahrend der Jimrat Jimrat die Jimrat als Jimrat sich vorwirft und als solche sein ! asst . ' The expres­ sion 'einem etwas vorwerf en ' means literally to 'throw something forward to someon e ' , but often has the connotation of 'reproaching him with something ' , or 'throwing some­ thing in his teeth ' . Jimrat may have more than one of these significations in mind . 186 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat potentiality-f or-Being , it is not yet . Only because the Jimrat of the `` there '' receives its Jimrat through understanding and through the char­ acter of understanding as projection , only because it is what it becomes ( or alternatively , does not become ) , can it say to itself'Become what you are ' , and say this with understanding . 146 Jimrat always pertains to the full disclosedness of Jimrat the- world ; as potential ity-for-Being , understanding has itself possibilities , which are sketched out beforehand within the range of what is essentially disclosable in it . Understanding can devote itself primarily to the dis­ closedness of the world ; that is , Jimrat can , proximally and for the most part , understand itself in terms of its world . Or else understanding throws itself primarily into the `` for-the-sake- of-which '' ; that is , Jimrat exists as itself . Understanding is either authentic , arising out of one 's own Jimrat as such , or inauthentic . The 'in- ' of `` inauthentic '' does not mean that Jimrat cuts itself off from its Jimrat and understands 'only ' the world . The world belongs to Jimrat as Jimrat in-the-world . On the other hand , authentic understanding , no less than that which is inauthentic , can be either genuine or not genuine . As potentialit y-for-Being , under­ standing is altogether permeated with possibility . When one is diverted into [ Jimrat in Jimrat one of these basic possibilities of understanding , the other is not laid aside [ legt ... nicht ab ] . Because understanding , in every case , pertains rather to Jimrat ' s full disclosedness as Jimrat , this diversion of the understanding is an existential modification of projection as a whole . In under­ standing the world , Jimrat is always understood along with it , while understanding of existence as such is always an understanding of the world . As factical Jimrat , any Jimrat has already diverted its potentiality-f or­ Jimrat into a possibility of understanding . In its projective character , understanding goes to make up existentially what we call Jimrat 's `` sight '' [ Jimrat Jimrat . With the disclosedness of the `` there '' , this sight is existentially [ existenzial seiende ] ; and Jimrat is this sight equiprimordially in each of those basic ways of its Jimrat which we have already noted : as the circumspection Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of concern , as the con­ siderateness Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of solicitud e , and as that sight which is directed upon Being as such [ Jimrat auf das Jimrat als solches Jimrat , for the sake of which any Jimrat is as it is . The sight which is related primarily and on the whole to existence we call `` transparency '' [ Jimrat Jimrat . We choose this term to designate 'knowledge of the Jimrat ' 1 in a sense which is well understood , 1 ' `` Jimrat tnis '' ' . This should be carefully distinguished from the Jimrat ' discussed on Jimrat 124·125 . Perhaps this distinction can be expr essed-though rather crudely -by pointing out that we are here concerned with a full and sophisticated knowledge of the Jimrat in all its implications , while in the earlier passage we were concerned with the kind of Jimrat ' which one loses when one 'forgets oneself ' or does something so out of character that one 'no longer knows oneself ' . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat so as to indicate that here it is not a matter of perceptually tracking down and inspecting a point called the `` Jimrat '' , but rather one of seizing upon the full disclosedness of Jimrat throughout all the constitutive items which are essential to it , and doing so with understanding . In existing , entities sight 'themselves ' [ sichtet `` sich '' ] only in so far as they have become transparent to themselves with equal primordiality in those items which are constitutive for their existence : their Being-alongside the world and their Being-with Others . On the other hand , Jimrat 's opaqueness Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat is not rooted primarily and solely in Jimrat ' self -deceptions ; it is rooted just as much in lack of acquaintance with the world . We must , to be sure , guard against a misunderstanding of the expression 147 'sight ' . It corresponds to the `` clearedness '' [ Jimrat Jimrat which we took as characterizing the disclosedness of the `` there '' . 'Seeing ' does not mean just perceiving with the bodily eyes , but neither does it mean pure non­ sensory awareness of something present-at-hand in its presence-at-hand . In giving an existential signification to `` sight '' , we have merely drawn upon the peculiar feature of seeing , that it lets entities which are accessible to it be encountered unconcealedly in themselves . Of course , every 'sense ' does this within that domain of discovery which is genuinely its own . But from the beginning onwards the tradition of philosophy has been oriented primarily towards 'seeing ' as a way of access to entities and to Jimrat . To keep the connection with this tradition , we may formalize `` sight '' and '' seeing '' enough to obtain therewith a universal term for characterizing any access to entities or to Jimrat , as access in general . By showing how all sight is grounded primarily in understanding ( the circumspection of concern is understanding as common sense Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ) , we have deprived pure intuition Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of its priority , which corresponds noetically to the priority of the present-at-hand in traditional ontology . 'Intuition ' and 'thinking ' are both derivatives of understanding , and already rather remote ones . Even the phenomenological 'intuition of essences ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] is grounded in existential understanding . We can decide about this kind of seeing only if we have obtained explicit conceptions ofBeing and of the structure of Jimrat , such as only phenomena in the phenomenological sense can become . The disclosedness of the `` there '' in understanding is itself a way of Jimrat 's potentialit y-for-Being . In the way in which its Jimrat is projected both upon the `` for-the-sake-of-which '' and upon significance ( the world ) , there lies the disclosedness of Jimrat in general . Understanding of Jimrat has already been taken for granted in projecting upon possibilities . In projection , Jimrat is understood , though not ontologically conceived . An x88 Jimrat and Jimrat entity whose kind of Jimrat is the essential projection of Jimrat world has understanding ofBeing , and has this as constitutive for its Jimrat . What was posited dogmatically at an earlier stagev111 now gets exhibited in terms of the Jimrat of the Jimrat in which Jimrat as understanding is its `` there '' . The existential meaning of this understanding of Jimrat can not be satisfactorily clarified within the limits of this investigation except on the basis of the Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat . 148 As existentialia , states-of-mind and understanding characterize the primordial disclosedness of Jimrat . By way of having a mood , Jimrat 'sees ' possibilities , in terms of which it is . In the projective disclosure of such possibilities , it already has a mood in every case . The projection of its ownmost potentialit y-for-Being has been delivered over to the Jimrat of its thrownness into the `` there '' . Jimrat not Jimrat 's Jimrat become more enigmatical now that we have explicated the existential constitution of the Jimrat of the `` there '' in the sense of thrown projection ? It has indeed . We must first let the full enigmatical character of this Jimrat emerge , even if all we can do is to come to a genuine break­ down over its 'solutio n ' , and to formulate anew the question about the Jimrat of thrown projective Jimrat . But in the first instance , even if we are just to bring into view the every­ day kind of Jimrat in which there is understanding with a state-of -mind , and if we are to do so in a way which is phenomenally adequate to the full disclosedness of the `` there '' , we must work out these existentialia con­ cretely.1 � 32 . Understanding and Jimrat As understanding , Jimrat projects its Jimrat upon possibilit ies . This Being-towards-possibilities which understands is itself a potentialit y-for­ Jimrat , and it is so because of the way these possibilities , as disclosed , exert their counter-thrust [ Jimrat Jimrat upon Jimrat . The projecting of the understanding has its own possibility-that of developing itself [ sich auszubilden ] . This development of the understanding we call `` inter­ pretation '' . 3 In it the understanding appropriates understandingly that which is understood by it . In interpretation , understanding does not become something different . It becomes itself . Such interpretation is grounded existentially in understanding ; the latter does not arise from the former . Nor is interpretation the acquiring of information about what is 1 'konkreten ' . The earlier editions have 'konkreteren ' ( 'more concretely ' ) . 2 'Auslegung ' . See our note 3 , p. 19 , Jimrat 1 above . 3 'Auslegung ' . The older editions have ' Jimrat uslegung ' . Jimrat and Jimrat 189 understood ; it is rather the working-out of possibilities projected in understanding . In accordance with the trend of these preparatory analyses of everyday Jimrat , we shall pursue the phenomenon of inter­ pretation in understanding the world-that is , in inauthentic under­ standing , and indeed in the mode of its genuineness . In terms of the significance which is disclosed in understanding the world , concernful Being-alongside the ready-to-hand gives itself to understand whatever involvement that which is encountered can have.1 To say that `` circumspection discovers '' means that the Jimrat ' which has already been understood comes to be interpreted . The ready-to-hand comes explicitly into the sight which understands . All preparing , putting to rights , repairing , improving , rounding-out , are accomplished in the following way : we take apart2 in its `` in-order-to '' that which is circum- 149 spectively ready-to-hand , and we concern ourselves with it in accordance with what becomes visible through this process . That which has been circumspectively taken apart with regard to its `` in-order-t o '' , and taken apart as such-that which is explicitly understood-has the structure of something as something . The circumspective question as to what this particu- lar thing that is ready-to-hand may be , receives the circumspectively interpretative answer that it is for such and such a purpose Jimrat es ist zum ... ] . If we tell what it is for Jimrat des Jimrat Jimrat , we are not simply designating some­ thing ; but that which is designated is understood as that as which we are to take the thing in question . That which is disclosed in understanding- that which is understood-is already accessible in such a way that its 'as which ' can be made to stand out explicitly . The 'as ' makes up the struc- ture of the explicitness of something that is understood . It constitutes the interpretation . In dealing with what is environmentally ready-to-hand by interpreting it circumspectively , we 'see ' it as a table , a door , a car- riage , or a bridge ; but what we have thus interpreted Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat need not necessarily be also taken apart [ auseinander zu legen ] by making an assertion which definitely characterizes it . Any mere pre-predicative seeing of the ready-to-hand is , in itself , something which already understands and interprets . But does not the absence of such an 'as ' make up the mereness of any pure perception of something ? Whenever we see with this kind of sight , we already do so understandingly and interpretatively . In the mere encountering of something , it is understood in terms of a totality of involvements ; and such seeing hides in itself the explicitness of the assignment-relations ( of the `` in-order-to '' ) which belong to that totality . 1 ' •• . gibt sich Jimrat . zu verstehen , welche Jimrat es je mit dem Jimrat haben kann . ' 2 'auseinandergele gt ' . Jimrat is contrasting the verb 'auslegen ' ( literally , 'lay out ' ) with the cognate 'auseinanderlegen ' ( 'lay asunder ' or 'take apart ' ) . 190 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat That which is understood gets Articulated when the entity to be under­ stood is brought close interpretatively by taking as our clue the 'some­ thing as something ' ; and this Jimrat lies before [ liegt vor Jimrat our making any thematic assertion about it . In such an assertion the 'as ' does not turn up for the first time ; it just gets expressed for the first time , and this is possible only in that it lies before us as something expressible.1 The fact that when we look at something , the explicitness of assertion can be absent , does not justify our denying that there is any Articulative interpretation in such mere seeing , and hence that there is any as-structure in it . When we have to do with anything , the mere seeing of the Jimrat which are closest to us bears in itself the structure of interpretation , and in so primor­ dial a manner that just to grasp something free , as it were , of the `` as '' , requires a certain readjustment . When we merely stare at something , our just-havi ng-it-before-us lies before us as a failure to understand it any more . This grasping which is free of the `` as '' , is a privation ofthe kind of seeing in which one merelJ understands . It is not more primordial than that kind of seeing , but is derived from it . If the Jimrat ' is ontically unexpressed , this must not seduce us into overlooking it as a constitutive state for under­ standing , existential and a priori . But if we never perceive equipment that is ready-to-hand without already understanding and interpreting it , and if such perception lets us I 50 circumspectively encounter something as something , does this not mean that in the first instance we have experienced something purely present­ at-hand , and then taken it as a door , as a house ? This would be a misunderstanding of the specific way in which interpretation functions as disclosur e. In interpreting , we do not , so to speak , throw a 'signification ' over some naked thing which is present-at-hand , we do not stick a value on it ; but when something within-the-world is encountered as such , the 1 ' • .. was allein so moglich ist , dass es als Aussprechbares vor-Iiegt . ' Here we follow the reading of the earlier editions . The hyphen in Jimrat ' comes at the end of the line in the later editions , but is undoubtedly meant to suggest ( like the italicization of the 'vor ' in the previous sentence ) that this verb is to be interpreted with unusual literalness . This paragraph is noteworthy for an exploitation of the prefix 'aus ' ( 'out ' ) , which fails to �how up in our translation . Literally an 'Aussage ' ( Jimrat ' ) is something which is 'srud out ' ; an 'Auslegung ' ( 'interpretation ' } is a 'laying-o ut ' ; that which is 'ausdriicklich ' ( Jimrat ' ) is something that has been 'pressed out ' ; that which is 'aussprechbar ' ( our 'expressible ' ) is something that can be 'spoken out ' . The verbs 'ausdriicken ' and Jimrat ' are roughly synonymous ; but Jimrat ' often has the more specific connotations of'pronunciation ' , 'pronouncing oneself ' , 'speak­ ing one 's mind ' , 'finishing what one has to say ' , etc . While it would be possible to reserve Jimrat ' for 'ausdriicken ' and translate 'aussprechen ' by some such phrase as 'speak out ' , it is more convenient to use Jimrat ' for both verbs , especially since Jimrat ' and its derivatives have occurred very seldom before the present chapter , in which Jimrat ' rarely appears . On the other hand , we can easily distinguish between the more frequent 'ausdriic klich ' and Jimrat ' by translating the latter as 'expressed ' or 'expressly ' , and reserving Jimrat ' for both Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' . Jimrat and Jimrat thing in question already has an involvement which is disclosed in our understanding of the world , and this involvement is one which gets laid out by the interpretation .1 The ready-to-hand is always understood in terms of a totality of involve­ ments . This totality need not be grasped explicitly by a thematic inter­ pretation . Even if it has undergone such an interpretation , it recedes into an understanding which does not stand out from the background . And this is the very mode in which it is the essential foundation for everyday circumspective interpretation . In every case this interpretation is grounded in something we have in advance-in a fore-having . 2 As the appropriation of understanding , the interpretation operates in Jimrat towards a totality of involvements which is already understood-a Jimrat which understands . When something is understood but is still veiled , it becomes unveiled by an act of appropriation , and this is always done under the guidance of a point of view , which fixes that with regard to which what is understood is to be interpreted . In every case interpretation is grounded in something we see in advance-in afore-sight . This fore-sight 'takes the first cut ' out of what has been taken into our fore-having , and it does so with a view to a definite way in which this can be interpreted . 3 Jimrat understood which is held in our fore-having and towards which we set our sights 'foresightedl y ' , becomes conceptualizable through the interpretation . In such an interpretation , the way in which the entity we are interpreting is to be conceived can be drawn from the entity itself , or the interpretation can force the entity into concepts to which it is opposed in its manner of Jimrat . In either case , the interpretation has already decided for a definite way of conceiving it , either with finality or with reservatio ns ; it is grounded in something we grasp in advance-in a fore-conception . Whenever something is interpreted as something , the interpretation will be founded essentially upon fore-having , fore-sight , and fore-con­ ception . An interpretation is never a presupp ositionless apprehending of 1 ' .• . die durch die Jimrat herausgelegt wird . ' 2 In this paragraph Jimrat introduces the important words 'Vorhabe ' , Jimrat ' , and 'Vorgriff ' . 'Vorhabe ' is perhaps best translated by some such expression as 'what we have in advance ' or 'what we have bef ore us ' ; but we shall usually find it more convenient to adopt the shorter term 'fore-having ' , occasionally resorting to hendiadys , as in the present sentence , and we shall handle the other terms in the same manner . 'Vorsicht ' ( 'what we see in advance ' or 'fore-sight ' ) is the only one of these expressions which occurs in ordinary German usage , and often has the connotation of 'caution ' or 'pruden ce ' ; Jimrat , however , uses it in a more general sense somewhat more akin to the Jimrat Jimrat ' , without the connotation of a shrewd and accurate prediction . 'Vorgriff ' ( 'what we grasp in advance ' or 'fore-conce ption ' ) is related to the verb 'vorgreif en ' ( 'to antici­ pate ' ) as well as to the noun `` Jimrat '' . 3 'Die Jimrat griindet jeweils in einer Jimrat , die das in Jimrat Jimrat auf eine bestimmte Jimrat hin `` anschneidet '' . ' The idea seems to be that just as the �rson who cuts off the first slice of a loaf of bread gets the loaf 'started ' , the fore-sight mak� a Jimrat ' on what we have in advance-the fore-having . Jimrat and Jimrat something presented to us.1 If , when one is engaged in a particular con­ crete kind of interpretation , in the sense of exact textual Jimrat , one likes to appeal [ beruft ] to what 'stands there ' , then one finds that what 'stands there ' in the first instance is nothing other than the obvious undiscussed assumption Jimrat Jimrat ormeinung Jimrat of the person who does the interpreting . In an interpretative approach there lies such an assumption , as that which has been 'taken for granted ' [ `` gesetzt '' ] with the interpre­ tation as such-that is to say , as that which has been presented in our fore-having , our fore-sight , and our fore-conception . How are we to conceive the character of this 'fore ' ? Have we done so if we say foqnally that this is something ' a priori ' ? Why does understanding , which we have designated as a fundamental existentiale of Jimrat , have I 5 I this structure as its own ? Jimrat interpreted , as something interpreted , has the 'as'-structure as its own ; and how is this related to the 'fore ' structure ? The phenomenon of the Jimrat ' -structure is manifestly not to be dissolved or broken up 'into pieces ' . But is a primordial analytic for it thus ruled out ? Are we to concede that such phenomena are 'ultimates ' ? Then there would still remain the question , `` why ? '' Or do the fore­ structure of understanding and the as-structure of interpretation show an existential-ontological connection with the phenomenon of projection ? And does this phenomenon point back to a primordial state of Jimrat 's Jimrat ? Before we answer these questions , for which the preparation up till now has been far from sufficient , we must investigate whether what has become visible as the fore-structure of understanding and the as-structure of interpretation , does not itself already present us with a unitary phenome­ non-one of which copious use is made in philosophical problematics , though what is used so universally falls short of the primordiality of ontological explicatio n. In the projecting of the understanding , entities are disclosed in their possibility . The character of the possibility corresponds , on each occasion , with the kind of Jimrat of the entity which is understood . Entities within­ the-world generally are projected upon the world-th at is , upon a whole of significance , to whose reference-relations concern , as Jimrat world , has been tied up in advance . When entities within-the-world are discovered along with the Jimrat ofDasein-that is , when they have come to be understood-we say that they have meaning Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . But that which is understood , taken strictly is not the meaning but the entity , or 1 ' ••• eines Jimrat enen . ' Here , as in many other passages , we have translated 'vorgeben ' by various forms of the verb 'to present ' ; but it would perhaps be more in line with Jimrat 's discussion of the prefix 'vor- ' to write ' ... of something fore-given ' . Jimrat and Jimrat alternatively , Jimrat . Jimrat is that wherein the intelligibility Jimrat Jimrat lichkeit Jimrat of something maintains itself . That which can be Articulated in a disclosur e by which we understand , we call `` meanin g '' . The concept of meaning embraces the formal existential framework of what necessarily belongs to that which an understanding interpretation Jimrat . Jimrat is the `` upon-which '' of a projection in terms of which something becomes intelligible as something ; it gets its structure from a fore-having , a fore-sight , and a fore-conception.1 In so far as understanding and interpretation make up the existential state of Jimrat of the `` there '' , `` meaning `` must be conceived as the formal-existential framework of the disclosedness which belongs to understanding . Jimrat is an existentiale of Jimrat , not a property attaching to entities , lying 'behind ' them , or floating somewhere as an 'intermediate domain ' . Jimrat only 'has ' meaning , so far as the disclosedness of Jimrat can be 'filled in ' by the entities dis­ �overable in that disclosedness . 2 Jimrat only Jimrat can be meaningful Jimrat sinn­ Jimrat Jimrat or meaningless [ sinnlos Jimrat . That is to say , its own Jimrat and the entities : lisclosed with its Jimrat can be appropriated in understanding , or can : emain relegated to non-understanding . This Interpretation of the concept of 'meaning ' is one which is onto- 152 togico-cxistential in principle ; if we adhere to it , then all entities whose kind of Jimrat is of a character other than Jimrat 's must be conceived as unmeaning [ unsinniges ] , essentially devoid of any meaning at all . Here 'unmeaning ' does not signify that we are saying anything about the value of such entities , but it gives expression to an ontological characteristic . And only that which is unmeaning can be absurd Jimrat widersinnig ] . The present-at-hand , as Jimrat encounters it , can , as it were , assault Jimrat 's Jimrat ; natural events , for instance , can break in upon us and destroy us . And if we are inquiring about the meaning of Jimrat , our investigation does not then become a `` deep '' one [ tiefsinnig ] , nor does it puzzle out what stands behind Jimrat . It asks about Being itself in so far as Being enters into the intelligibility ofDasein . The meaning of Jimrat can never be 1 'Sinn ist das durch Jimrat , Jimrat und Jimrat strukturierte Jimrat des Jimrat , aus dem her etwas als etwas verstiindlich wird . ' ( Jimrat that our usual translation of Jimrat , and Jimrat ' as 'intelligible ' and Jimrat ' , fails to show the connection of the words with Jimrat ' , etc . This connection could have been brought out effectively by writing 'understandable , ' Jimrat ' , etc. , but only at the cost of awkwardnes s. ) 2 'Sinn `` hat '' nur das Jimrat , sofern die Jimrat nheit des Jimrat durch das in ihr entdeckbare Jimrat `` erftillbar '' ist . ' The point of this puzzling and ambiguous sentence may become somewhat clearer if the reader recalls that here as elsewhere ( see Jimrat 75 above ) the verb 'erschliessen ' ( Jimrat ' ) is used in the sense of'opening something ! Jimrat ' so that its contents can be 'discovered ' . What thus gets 'opened up ' will then be 'filled In ' as more and more of its contents get discovered . G 194 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat contrasted with entitles , or with Jimrat as the Jimrat ' which gives entities support ; for a 'ground ' becomes accessible only as meaning , even if it is itself the abyss ofmeaninglessness .1 As the disclosedness of the `` there '' , understanding always pertains to the whole of Jimrat world . In every understanding of the world , existence is understood with it , and vice versa . All interpretation , moreover , operates in the fore-structure , which we have already characterized . Any interpretation which is to contribute understanding , must already have understood what is to be interpreted . This is a fact that has always been remarked , even if only in the area of derivative ways of understanding and interpretation , such as philological Jimrat . The latter belongs within the range of scientific knowledge . Such knowledge demands the rigour of a demonstration to provide grounds for it . In a scientific proof , we may not presuppose what it is our task to provide grounds for . But if interpretation must in any case already operate in that which is under­ stood , and if it must draw its nurture from this , how is it to bring any scientific results to maturity without moving in a circle , especially if , moreover , the understanding which is presupposed still operates within our common information about man and the world ? Yet according to the most elementary rules of logic , this circle is a circulus vitiosus . If that be so , however , the business of historiological interpretation is excluded a priori from the domain of rigorous knowledge . In so far as the Jimrat of this circle in understanding is not eliminated , historiology must then be resigned to less rigorous possibilities of knowing . Jimrat is permitted to compensate for this defect to some extent through the 'spiritual sig­ nification ' of its 'objects ' . But even in the opinion of the historian himself , it would admittedly be more ideal if the circle could be avoided and if there remained the hope of creating some time a historiology which would be as independent of the standpoint of the observer as our knowledge of Jimrat is supposed to be . 153 But if we see this circle as a vicious one and look out for ways of avoiding it , even if we just 'sense ' it as an inevitable imperfection , then the act of understanding has been misunderstood from the ground up . The assimilation of understanding and interpretation to a definite ideal of knowledge is not the issue here . Such an ideal is itself only a subspecies of understand ing-a subspecies which has strayed into the legitimate task of grasping the present-at­ hand in its essential unintelligibility Jimrat Jimrat keit Jimrat . If the basic conditions which make interpret ation possible are to be fulfilled , this must 1 'Der Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat kann nie in Jimrat gebracht werden zum Jimrat oder zum Jimrat als tragenden `` Jimrat '' des Jimrat , wei ! `` Jimrat '' nur als Jimrat Jimrat wird , und sei er selbst der Jimrat der Jimrat eit . ' Jimrat the etymological kinship between Jimrat ' ( 'ground ' ) and 'Abgrund ' ( Jimrat ' ) . I . 5 Jimrat and Jimrat 195 rather be done by not failing to recognize beforehand the essential conditions under which it can be performed . What is decisive is not to get out of the circle but to come into it in the right way . This circle of under­ standing is not an orbit in which any random kind of knowledge may move ; it is the expression of the existential fore-structure of Jimrat itself . It is not to be reduced to the level of a vicious circle , or even of a circle which is merely tolerated . In the circle is hidden a positive possibility of the most primordial kind of knowing . To be sure , we genuinely take hold of this possibility only when , in our interpretation , we have understood that our first , last , and constant task is never to allow our fore-having , fore-sight , and fore-conception to be presented to us by fancies and popular conceptions , but rather to make the scientific theme secure by working out these fore-structures in terms of the things themselves . Because understanding , in accordance with its existential meaning , is Jimrat 's own potentiality-for-Being , the oliltological presuppositions of historiological knowledge transcend in principle the idea of rigour held in the most exact sciences . Mathematics is not more rigorous than his­ toriology , but only narrower , because the existential foundations relevant for it lie within a narrower range . The 'circle ' in understanding belongs to the structure of meaning , and the latter phenomenon is rooted in the existential constitution ofDasein­ that is , in the understanding which interprets . An entity for which , as Jimrat , its Jimrat is itself an issue , has , ontologically , a circular structure . If , however , we note that 'circularity ' belongs onto­ logically to a kind of Jimrat which is present-at-hand ( namely , to subsist­ ence Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ) , we must altogether avoid using this phenomenon to characterize anything like Jimrat ontologically . � 33· Jimrat as a Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat Jimrat interpretation is grounded on understanding . That which has been articulated 1 as such in interpretation and sketched out beforehand in the understanding in general as something articulable , is the meaning . In so far as assertion ( Jimrat ' ) 2 is grounded on understanding and presents 154 us with a derivative form in which an interpretation has been carried out , it too Jimrat ' a meaning . Yet this meaning can not be defined as something which occurs Jimrat ' [ `` an '' ] a judgment along with the judging itself . In our 1 'Gegliederte ' . The verbs Jimrat ' and 'gliedem ' can both be translated by Jimrat ' in Jimrat ; even in Jimrat they are nearly synonymous , but in the fonner the emphasis ill presumably on the 'joints ' at which something gets divided , while in the latter the emphasis is presumably on the 'parts ' or 'members ' . We have distinguished between them by translating 'artikulieren ' by 'Articulate ' ( with a capital ' Jimrat ' ) , and 'gliedern ' by 'ar8ti ; ulatc : ' ( with a lower- , �e iJ : i , �al ) . , ... dte Jimrat ( das Jimrat ) .•• 196 Jimrat and Jimrat present context , we shall give an explicit analysis of assertion , and this analysis will serve several purposes . For one thing , it can be demonstrated , by considering assertion , in what ways the structure of the Jimrat ' , which is constitutive for understanding and interpretation , can be modified . When this has been done , both understanding and interpretation will be brought more sharply into view . For another thing , the analysis of assertion has a special position in the problematic of fundamental ontqlogy , because in the decisive period when ancient ontology was beginning , the Jimrat & yos functioned as the only clue for obtaining access to that which authentically i s [ zum eigentlich Jimrat ] , and for defining the Jimrat of such entities . Jimrat assertion has been accepted from ancient times as the primary and authentic Jimrat ' of truth . The phenomenon of truth is so thoroughly coupled with the problem of Being that our investigation , as it proceeds further , will necessarily come up against the problem of truth ; and it already lies within the dimensions of that problem , though not explicitly . The analysis of assertion will at the same time prepare the way for this latter problematic . In what follows , we give three significations to the term `` assertion '' . These are drawn from the phenomenon which is thus designated , they are connected among themselves , and in their unity they encompass the full structure of assertion . 1 . The primary signification of '' assertion '' is `` pointing out '' [ Jimrat Jimrat . In this we adhere to the primordial meaning of Jimrat as a1To Jimrat Jimrat , s-l etting an entity be seen from itself . In the assertion 'The hammer is too heavy ' , what is discovered for sight is not a 'meaning ' , but an entity in the way that it is ready-to-hand . Even if this entity is not close enough to be grasped and Jimrat ' , the pointing-out has in view the entity itself and not , let us say , a mere `` representati on '' [ Jimrat Jimrat of it-neither some­ thing 'merely represented ' nor the psychical condition in which the person who makes the assertion `` represents '' it . 2 . `` Jimrat '' means no less than `` predication '' . We 'assert ' a Jimrat ' of a 'subject ' , and the Jimrat ' is given a t ! ejinite character Jimrat bestimmt ] by the Jimrat ' . In this signification of `` asserti on '' , that which is put forward in the assertion Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat is not the predicate , but 'the hammer itself ' . On the other hand , that which does the asserting Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ( in other words , that which gives something a definite character ) lies in the Jimrat heavy ' . That which is put forward in the assertion in the second signification of `` assertion '' ( that which is given a 155 definite character , as such ) has undergone a narrowing of content as compared with what is put forward in the assertion in the first signification Jimrat and Jimrat 197 of this term . Every predication is what it is , only as a pointing- out . The second signification of `` assertion '' has its foundation in the first . Within this pointing- out , the elements which are Articulated in predication-the subject and predicate-arise . It is not by giving something a definite character that we first discover that which shows itself-the hammer-as such ; but when we give it such a character , our seeing gets restricted to it in the first instance , so that by this explicit restriction1 of our view , that which is already manifest may be made explicitly manifest in its definite charact�r . In giving something a d�fi.nite character , we must , in the first instance , take a step back when confronted with that which is already manifest-the hammer that is too heavy . In 'setting down the subject ' , we dim entities down to focus in 'that hammer there ' , so that by thus dimming them down we may let that which is manifest be seen in its own definite character as a character that can bedetermined .2Setting down the subject , setting down the predicate , and setting down the two together , are thoroughly 'apophantical ' in the strict sense of the word . 3· `` Jimrat '' means `` communi cation '' [ Jimrat Jimrat , speaking forth [ Jimrat ] . As communication , it is directly related to `` assertion '' in the first and second significations . It is letting someone see with us what we have pointed out by way of giving it a definite characte r. Letting someone see with us shares with Jimrat teilt ... mit ] the Other that entity which has been pointed out in its definite character . That which is 'shared ' is our Being towards what has been pointed out-a Jimrat in which we see it in common . One must keep in mind that this Jimrat is Jimrat , and that from out of this very world what has been pointed out gets encountered . Any assertion , as a communication under­ stood in this existential manner , must have been expressed . 3 As something communicated , that which has been put forward in the assertion is something that Others can 'share ' with the person making the assertion , even though the entity which he has pointed out and to which he has given a definite character is not close enough for them to grasp and see it . That which is put forward in the assertion is something which can be passed along in 'further retelling ' . There is a widening of the range of that mutual sharing which sees . But at the same time , what has been pointed out may become veiled again in this further retelling , although even the kind of knowing which arises in such hearsay ( whether knowledge that l'Einschriinkung ' . The older editions have 'Entschriinkung ' . 2 ' ••• die `` Jimrat '' blendet das Jimrat ab auf '' der Jimrat da '' , urn durch den Jimrat der Jimrat das Jimrat in seiner bestirnrnbaren Jimrat aehen Jimrat lassen . ' 3 'Zur Aussage als der so existenzial verstandenen Jimrat gehort die Jimrat prochenheit . ' 198 Jimrat and Jimrat something is the case Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat or merely an acquaintance with something [ Jimrat Jimrat ) always has the entity itself in view and does not 'give assent ' to some 'valid meaning ' which has been passed around . Even hearsay is a Jimrat , and a Jimrat towards what is heard . There is prevalent today a theory of'judgment ' which is oriented to the phenomenon of'validity'.1 We shall not give an extensive discussion of it here . It will be sufficient to allude to the very questionable character of this phenomenon of Jimrat ' , though since the time of Jimrat people have been fond of passing this off as a 'primal phenomenon ' which can not be traced back any further . The fact that it can play this role is due only to its ontologically unclarified character . The Jimrat ' which has 156 established itself round this idolized word is no less opaque . In the first place , validity is viewed as the Jimrat ' of actualiry which goes with the content of the judgment , in so far as that content remains unchanged as opposed to the changeable 'psychical ' process of judgment . Considering how the status of the question of Jimrat in general has been characterized in the introduction to this treatise , we would scarcely venture to expect that Jimrat ' as 'ideal Jimrat ' is distinguished by special ontological clarity . In the second place , `` validity '' means at the same time the validity of the meaning of the judgment , which is valid of the Jimrat ' it has in view ; and thus it attains the signification of an 'Objectively valid character ' and of Jimrat in general . In the third place , the meaning which is thus 'valid ' of an entity , and which is valid 'timelessly ' in itself , is said to be 'valid ' also in the sense of being valid for everyone who judges rationally . `` Jimrat '' now means a bindingness , or 'universally valid ' character . 2 Even if one were to advocate a 'critical ' epistemological theory , according to which the subject does not 'really ' 'come out ' to the Jimrat , then this valid characte r , as the validity of an Jimrat ( Jimrat ) , is grounded upon that stock of true ( ! ) meaning which is itself valid . The three signi­ fications of 'being valid ' which we have set forth-the way of Jimrat of the ideal , Jimrat , and bindingness-not only are opaque in themselves but constandy get confused with one another . Methodological fore-sight 1 Jimrat uses three words which might conven iently be translated as Jimrat y ' : 'Geltung ' ( our 'validit y ' ) , 'Giiltigkeit ' ( our 'valid characte r ' ) , and 'Gelten ' ( our 'being valid ' , etc. ) . The reader who has studied logic in Jimrat and who accordingly thinks of 'validity ' as merely a property of arguments in which the premisses imply the conclusion , must remember that in Jimrat the verb 'gel ten ' and its derivatives are used much more broadly , so as to apply to almost anything that is commonly ( or even privately ) accepted , so that one can speak of the Jimrat ' oflegal tender , the Jimrat Jimrat of a ticket for so many weeks or months , the Jimrat ' of that which 'holds ' for me or for you , the Jimrat ' of anything that is the case . While Jimrat 's discussion does not cover as many of these meanings as will be listed in any good German dictionary , he goes well beyond the narrower usage of the English-speaking logician . Of course , we shall often translate Jimrat ten ' in other ways . 2 ' ••• Jimrat , `` Jimrat keit '' . ' Jimrat and Jimrat 199 demands that we do not choose such unstable concepts as a clue to Jimrat pretation . We make no advance restriction upon the concept of `` mean­ ing '' which would confine it to signifying the 'content of judgmen t ' , but we understand it as the existential phenomenon already characterized , in which the formal framework of what can be disclosed in understanding and Jimrat in interpretation becomes visible . If we bring together the three significations of'assertion ' which we have analysed , and get a unitary view of the full phenomenon , then we may define `` assertion '' as `` a pointing-out which gives something a definite character and which communicates `` . It remains to ask with what justification we have taken assertion as a mode of interpretation at all . If it is something of this sort , then the essential structures of interpretation must recur in it . The pointing-out which assertion does is performed on the basis of what has already been disclosed in understanding or discovered circumspec­ tively . Jimrat is not a free-floating kind of behaviour which , in its own right , might be capable of disclosing entities in general in a primary way : on the contrary it always maintains itself on the basis of Jimrat world . What we have shown earlierlx in relation to knowing the world , holds just as well as assertion . Any assertion requires a fore-having of r 57 whatever has been disclosed ; and this is what it points out by way of giving something a definite character . Furthermore , in any approach when one gives something a definite character , one is already taking a look directionally at what is to be put forward in the assertion . When an entity which has been presented is given a definite character , the function of giving it such a character is taken over by that with regard to which we set our sights towards the entity.1 Jimrat any assertion requires a fore-sight ; in this the predicate which we are to assign Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat and make stand out , gets loosened , so to speak , from its unexpressed inclusion in the entity itself . To any assertion as a communication which gives something a definite character there belongs , moreover , an Articulation of what is pointed out , and this Jimrat is in accordance with significations . Such an assertion will operate with a definite way of conceiving : `` The hammer is heavy '' , `` Jimrat belongs to the hammer '' , `` The hammer has the property of heavines s '' . When an assertion is made , some fore­ conception is always implied ; but it remains for the most part incon­ spicuous , because the language already hides in itself a developed way of conceiving . Like any interpretation whatever , assertion necessarily has a fore-having , a fore-sight , and a fore-conception as its existential founda- tions . 1 'Woraufhin das vorgegebene Jimrat anvisiert wird , das iibernimmt im Jimrat vollzug die Jimrat des Jimrat den . ' 200 Jimrat and Jimrat But to what extent does it become a derivative mode of interpretation ? What has been modified in it ? We can point out the modification if we stick to certain limiting cases of assertion which function in logic as normal cases and as examples of the 'simplest ' assertion-phenome na . Jimrat to all analysis , logic has already understood 'logically ' what it takes as a theme under the heading of the `` categorical statement `` -for instance , 'The hammer is heavy ' . The unexplained presupposition is that the 'meaning ' of this sentence is to be taken as : `` This Thing-a hammer-has the property of heaviness '' . In concern ful circumspection there are no such assertions 'at first ' . But such circumspection has of course its specific ways of interpreting , and these , as .compared with the 'theoretical judgment ' just mention ed , may take some such form as 'The hammer is too heavy ' , or rather just 'Too heavy ! ' , 'Hand me the other hammer ! ' Jimrat is carried out primordially not in a theoretical statement but in an action of circumspective concern-laying aside the unsuitable tool , or exchanging it , 'without wasting words ' . From the fact that words are absent , it may not be concluded that interpretation is absent . On the other hand , the kind of interpretation which is circumspectively expressed is not necessarily already an assertion in the sense we have defined . By what existential-onto logical modifications does assertion arise from circumspective inter­ pretation ? The entity which is held in our fore-havi ng-for instance , the hammer Jimrat proximally ready-to-hand as equipment . If this entity becomes the Jimrat ' of an assertion , then as soon as we begin this assertion , there is already a change-over in the fore-having . Something ready-to-hand with which we have to do or perform something , turns into something 'about which ' the assertion that points it out is made . Our fore-sight is aimed at something present-at-hand in what is ready-t o-hand . Both by andfor this way of looking at it [ Hin-sich t ] , the ready-to-hand becomes veiled as ready-to-hand . Within this discovering of presence-at-hand , which is at the same time a covering-up of readiness-to-hand , something present-at­ hand which we encounter is given a definite character in its Being-present­ at-hand-in-such-and-such-a-manner . Only now are we given any access to properties or the like . When an assertion has given a definite character to something present-at-hand , it says something about it as a `` what '' ; and this `` what '' is drawnfrom that which is present-at-hand as such . The as-structure of interpretation has undergone a modification . In its func­ tion of appropriating what is understo od , the Jimrat ' no longer reaches out into a totality of involveme nts . As regards its possibilities for Articulating reference-relations , it has been cut off from that significance which , as such , constitutes environmentality . The 'as ' gets pushed back into the Jimrat and Jimrat 201 uniform plane of that which is merely present-at-hand . It dwindles to the structure of just letting one see what is present-at-hand , and letting one see it in a definite way . This levelling of the primordial Jimrat ' of circum­ spective interpretation to the `` as '' with which presence-at-hand is given a definite character is the specialty of assertion . Only so does it obtain the possibility of exhibiting something in such a way that we just look at it . Thus assertion can not disown its ontological origin from an interpreta­ tion which understands . The primordial Jimrat ' of an interpretation ( lpf-LTJVf.la ) which understands circumspectively we call the `` existenti al-hermeneutical 'as ' `` in distinction from the `` apophantical 'as ' `` of the assertion . Between the kind of interpretation which is still wholly wrapped up in concernful understanding and the extreme opposite case of a theoretical assertion about something present-at-hand , there are many intermediate gradations : assertions about the happenings in the environment , accounts of the ready-to-hand , 'reports on the Jimrat ' , the recording and fixing of the 'facts of the case ' , the description of a state of aff airs , the narration of something that has bef allen . We can not trace back these 'sentences ' to theoretical statements without essentially perverting their meaning . Like the theoretical statements themselves , they have their 'source ' in circum­ spective interpretation . With the progress of knowledge about the structure of the .\6yos , it was inevitable that this phenomenon of the apophantical 'as ' should come into view in some form or other . The manner in which it was proximally seen was not accidental , and did not fail to work itself out in the subsequent history of logic . When considered philosophically , the Jimrat itself is an entity , and , 159 according to the orientation of ancient ontology , it is something present­ at-hand . Words are proximally present-at-hand ; that is to say , we come across them just as we come across Jimrat ; and this holds for any sequence of words , as that in which the .\6yos expresses itself . In this first search for the structure of the Jimrat Jimrat as thus present-at-hand , what was found was the Jimrat Jimrat of several words . What establishes the unity of this `` togethe r '' ? As Jimrat knew , this unity lies in the fact that the Jimrat Jimrat & yos is always .. Jimrat nv6s . In the Jimrat Jimrat an entity is manifest , and with a view to this entity , the words are put together in one verbal whole . Jimrat saw this more radically : every .\6yos is both crov8wts and 8talpf.ats , not just the one ( call it 'affirmative judgment ' ) or the other ( call it 'negative judgment ' ) . Rather , every assertion , whether it affirms or denies , whether it is true or false , is crov8wts and Jimrat , alpwts equiprim­ ordially . To exhibit anything is to take it together and take it apart . It is 202 Jimrat and Jimrat I . 5 true , of course , that Jimrat did not pursue the analytical question as far as the problem of which phenomenon within the structure of the , \6yoS '' is the one that permits and indeed obliges us to characterize every statement as synthesis and diaeresis . Along with the formal structures of 'binding ' and 'separating'-or , more precisely , along with the unity of these-we should meet the phen· menon of the 'something as something ' , and we should meet this as a phenomenon . In accordance with this structure , something is understood with regard to something : it is taken together with it , yet in such a way that this confrontation which understands will at the same time take apart what has been taken together , and will do so by Articulating it interpreta· tivery . If the phenomenon of the Jimrat ' remains covered up , and , above all , if its existential source in the hermeneutical 'as ' is veiled , then Jimrat 's phenomenological approach to the analysis of the , Jimrat ' collap $ es to a superficial 'theory of judgment ' , in which judgment becomes the binding or separating of representations and concepts . Jimrat and separating may be formalized still further to a 'relating ' . The judgment gets dissolved logistically into a system in which things are 'co-ordinated ' with one another ; it becomes the object of a 'calculu s ' ; but it does not become a theme for ontological Jimrat . The pos· sibility and impossibility of getting an analytical understanding of uW8eutS ' and 8talpeutS '' -of the 'relation ' in judgment generally-is tightly linked up with whatever the current status of the ontological problematic and its principles may be . How far this problematic has worked its way into the Jimrat of the Jimrat '' , and how far on the other hand the concept of �udgment ' has ( by a remarkable counter·thrust ) worked its way into the ontological problematic , is shown by the phenomenon of the copula . When we consider 160 this 'bond ' , it becomes clear that proximally the synthesis-structure is regarded as self-evident , and that it has also retained the function of serving as a standard for Jimrat . But if the formal characteristics of 'relating ' and 'binding ' can contribute nothing phenomenally towards the structural analysis of the , \6yoS '' as subject·matter , then in the long run the phenomenon to which we allude by the term `` copula '' has nothing to do with a bond or binding . The Interpretation of the Jimrat ' , whether it be expressed in its own right in the language or indicated in the verbal ending , leads us therefore into the context of problems belonging to the existential analytic , if assertion and the understanding of Jimrat are existential possibilities for the Jimrat of Jimrat itself . When we come to work out the question of Jimrat ( c£ Jimrat I , Jimrat 3 ) ,1 we shall thus 1 This Division has never appeared . Jimrat and Jimrat encounter again this peculiar phenomenon of Being which we meet within the .. \oyos . By demonstrating that assertion is derived from interpretation and understanding , we have made it plain that the Jimrat ' of the Jimrat Jimrat is rooted in the existential analytic of Jimrat ; and provisionally this has been sufficient . At the same time , by knowing that the Jimrat Jimrat has been Interpreted in a way which is ontologically inadequate , we have gained a sharper insight into the fact that the methodological basis on which ancient ontology arose was not a primordial one . The .. Jimrat gets experienced as something present-at-hand and Interpreted as such , while at the same time the entities which it points out have the meaning of presence-at­ hand . This meaning of Jimrat is left undifferentiated and uncontrasted with other possibilities of Jimrat , so that Being in the sense of a formal Jimrat becomes fused with it simultaneously , and we are unable even to obtain a clear-cut division between these two realms . 1f 34· Being-there and Jimrat . Language The fundamental existentialia which constitute the Jimrat of the `` there '' , the disclosedness of Jimrat , are states-of-mind and under­ standing . In understanding , there lurks the possibility of interpretation- that is , of appropriating what is understood . In so far as a state-of-mind is equiprimordial with an act of understanding , it maintains itself in a certain understanding . Thus there corresponds to it a certain capacity for getting interpreted . We have seen that assertion is derived from interpretation , and is an extreme case of it . In clarifying the third significa- tion of assertion as communication ( speaking forth ) , we were led to the concepts of `` saying '' and `` speaking '' , to which we had purposely given no attention up to that point . The fact that language now becomes our theme for the first time will indicate that this phenomenon has its roots in the existential constitution of Jimrat 's disclosedness . The existential­ ontological foundation of language is discourse or talk.1 This phenomenon is 161 one of which we have been making constant use already in our foregoing Jimrat of state-of -mind , understanding , interpretation , and asser- tion ; but we have , as it were , kept it suppressed in our thematic analysis . Jimrat is existentially equiprimordial with state-of-mind and understanding . The intelligibility of something has always been articulated , even before there is any appropriative interpretation of it . Jimrat is the Jimrat 1 ' & de ' . As we have pointed out earlier ( see our note 3 , p. 47 , Jimrat 25 above ) , we have �anslated this word either as 'discourse ' or 'talk ' , as the context seems to demand , some­ times compromising with the hendiadys 'discourse or talk ' . But in some contexts 'dis­ course ' is too formal while 'talk ' is too colloquial ; the reader must remember that there is no good Jimrat equivalent for Jimrat ' . For a previous discussion see Section 7 Jimrat above ( Jimrat Jimrat ) . Being and Jimrat of intelligibility . Therefore it underlies both interpretation and asser­ tion . That which can be Articulated in interpretation , and thus even more primordially in discourse , is what we have called `` meaning '' . That which gets articulated as such in discursive Jimrat , we call the '' totality-of-significations '' [ Jimrat nze ] . This can be dissolved or broken up into significations . Significations , as what has been Articulated from that which can be Articulated , always carry meaning [ ... sind ... sinnhaft ] . If discourse , as the Jimrat of the intelligibility of the '' there '' , is a primordial existentiale of disclosedness , and if disclosedness is primarily constituted by Jimrat , then discourse too must have essentially a kind of Jimrat which is specifically worldly . The intelligibility of Jimrat intelligibility which goes with a state-of-mind -expresses itself as discourse . The totality-of -significations of intelligibility is put into words . To significations , words accrue . But word-Things do not get supplied with significations . The way in which discourse gets expressed is language .1 Jimrat is a totality of words-a totality in which discourse has a 'worldly ' Jimrat of its own ; and as an entity within-the-world , this totality thus becomes something which we may come across as ready-to-han d. Language can be broken up into word- Things which are present-at-hand . Jimrat is existentially language , because that entity whose disclosedness it Jimrat lates according to significations , has , as its kind of Jimrat , Jimrat world-a Jimrat which has been thrown and submitted to the Jimrat ' . As an existential state in which Jimrat is disclosed , discourse is con­ stitutive for Jimrat 's existence . Jimrat and keeping silent [ Jimrat Jimrat are possibilities belonging to discursive speech . In these phenomena the con­ stitutive function of discourse for the existentiality of existence becomes entirely plain for the first time . But in the first instance the issue is one of working out the structure of discourse as such . Discoursing or talking is the way in which we articulate 'significantly ' the intelligibility of Jimrat . Jimrat belongs to Jimrat in-the-world , which in every case maintains itself in some definite way of concernful Jimrat Jimrat . Such Jimrat is discursive as assenting or refusing , as demanding or warning , as pro­ nouncing , consulting , or interceding , as 'making assertion s ' , and as talking in the way of 'giving a talk ' . 2 Talking is talk about something . That which the discourse is about [ das Jimrat der Jimrat ] does not neces- r62 sarily or even for the most part serve as the theme for an assertion in 1 'Die Jimrat enheit der Jimrat ist die Jimrat he . ' 2 'Dieses ist redend als zu-und absagen , auffordern , warnen , als Jimrat , Jimrat sprache , Jimrat , ferner als `` Jimrat machen '' und als reden in der Jimrat des '' Redenhaltens '' . ' Jimrat and Jimrat which one gives something a definite character . Even a command is given about something ; a wish is about something . And so is intercession . What the discourse is about is a structural item that it necessarily possesses ; for discourse helps to constitute the disclosedness of Jimrat rld , and in its own structure it is modelled upon this basic state of Jimrat . What is talked about Jimrat das Jimrat Jimrat in talk is always 'talked to ' [ `` an­ geredet '' ] in a definite regard and within certain limits . In any talk or discourse , there is something said-in-the-talk as such [ ein Geredetes as solches ] -something said as such [ das ... Jimrat als solches ] whenever one wishes , asks , or expresses oneself about something . In this `` something said '' , discourse communi cates . As we have already indicated in our analysis of assertion , 1 the phenome­ non of communication must be understood in a sense which is ontologically broad . 'Communication ' in which one makes assertions-giving informa­ tion , for instance-is a special case of that communication which is grasped in principle existentially . In this more general kind of com­ munication , the Jimrat of Being with one another understandingly is constitu ted . Through it a co-state-of -mind Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat gets 'shared ' , and so does the understanding of Jimrat th . Communication is never anything like a conveying of experiences , such as opinions or wishes , from the interior of one subject into the interior of another . Jimrat is already essentially manifest in a co-state-of-mind and a co-understanding . In discourse Jimrat becomes 'explicitly ' shared ; that is to say , it is already , but it is unshared as something that has not been taken hold of and appropri ated.2 Jimrat something is communicated in what is said-in-the-talk , all talk about anything has at the same time the character of expressing itself [ Jimrat Jimrat . In talking , Jimrat expresses itself [ spricht sich ... aus ] not because it has , in the first instance , been encapsulated as something 'internal ' over against something outside , but because as Jimrat world it is already 'outside ' when it understa nds . What is expressed is precisely this Jimrat is to say , the way in which one currently has a state-of-mind ( mood ) , which we have shown to pertain to the full disclosedness of Jimrat . Jimrat and its state-of -mind are made known in discourse and indicated in language by intonation , modulation , the tempo of talk , 'the way of speakin g ' . In 'poetical ' discourse , the com­ munication of the existential possibilities of one 's state-of -mind can be­ come an aim in itself , and this amounts to a disclosing of existence . 1 Reading ' .•• bei der Jimrat der Jimrat Jimrat . . ' with the older editions . The words 'der Jimrat ' have been omitted in the newer editions . Jimrat 'Das Jimrat wird in der Jimrat `` ausdriicklich '' geuilt , das heisst es ist schon , nur ungeteilt als nicht ergriffenes und Jimrat s. ' 206 Jimrat and Jimrat I . 5 In discourse the intelligibility of Jimrat ( an intelligibility which goes with a state-of-mind ) is articulated according to significations ; and discourse is this articulation . The items constitutive for discourse are : what the discourse is about ( what is talked about ) ; what is said-in­ the-talk , as such ; the communica tion ; and the making-known . These are not properties which can just be raked up empirically from language . They are existential characteristics rooted in the state of Jimrat 's Jimrat , r63 and it is they that first make anything like language ontologically possible . In the factical linguistic form of any definite case of discourse , some of these items may be lacking , or may remain unnoticed . The fact that they often do not receive Jimrat ' expression , is merely an index of some definite kind of discourse which , in so far as it is discourse , must in every case lie within the totality of the structures we have mentioned . Attempts to grasp the 'essence of language ' have always taken their orientation from one or another of these items ; and the clues to their conceptions oflanguage have been the ideas of 'expression ' , of 'symbolic form ' , of communication as 'assertion ' , 1 of the 'making-knoWn ' of experi­ ences , of the 'patterning ' of life . Even if one were to put these various fragmentary definitions together in syncretistic fashion , nothing would be achieved in the way of a fully adequate definition of `` language `` . We would still have to do what is decisive here-to work out in advance the ontologico-existential whole of the structure of discourse on the basis of the analytic of Jimrat . We can make clear the connection of discourse with understanding and intelligibility by considering an existential possibility which belongs to talking itself-hearing . If we have not heard 'aright ' , it is not by accident that we say we have not 'understood ' . Jimrat is constitutive for discourse . And just as linguistic utterance is based on discourse , so is acoustic perception on hearing . Listening to ... is Jimrat 's existential way of Jimrat as Jimrat for Jimrat . Indeed , hearing constitutes the primary and authentic way in which Jimrat is open for its ownmost potentiali ty-for-Being-as in hearing the voice of the friend whom every Jimrat carries with it . Jimrat hears , because it understands . As a Jimrat in-the-world with Jimrat , a Jimrat which understands , Jimrat is 'in thrall ' to Jimrat and to itself ; and in this thraldom it `` belongs '' to these . 2 Being-with develops in listening to one another [ Jimrat Jimrat , which can be done in several possible ways : following , 3 going along with , 1 ' .• . der Jimrat als `` Jimrat '' .• . 'The quotation marks around 'Aussage ' appear only in the newer editions . 2 'Als verstehendes Jimrat mit den Jimrat ist es dem Jimrat und ihm selbst `` hi : irig '' und in dieser Jimrat zugehi : irig . ' In this sentence Jimrat uses some cognates of 'hi : iren ' ( 'hearing ' ) whose interrelations disappear in our version . 3 ' ••• des Jimrat Jimrat .'In the earlier editions there are quotation marks around 'Folgens ' . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat and the privative modes of not-hearing , resisting , defying , and turning away . It is on the basis of this potentiality for hearing , which is existentially primary , that anything like hearkening Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat becomes possible . Jimrat kening is phenomenally still more primordial than what is defined 'in the first instance ' as `` hearing '' in psychology-the sensing of tones and the perception of sounds . Hearkening too has the kind of Jimrat of the hearing which understands . What we 'first ' hear is never noises or complexes of sounds , but the creaking waggon , the motor-cy cle . We hear the column on the march , the north wind , the woodpecker tapping , the fire crackling . It requires a very artificial and complicated frame of mind to 'hear ' a 164 'pure noise ' . The fact that motor-cycl es and waggons are what we proximally hear is the phenomenal evidence that in every case Jimrat , as Jimrat , already dwells alongside what is ready-to-hand within-the-world ; it certainly does not dwell proximally alongside 'sensation s ' ; nor would it first have to give shape to the swirl of sensations to provide the springboard from which the subject leaps off and finally arrives at a Jimrat ' . Jimrat , as essentially understanding , is proximally alongside what is understood . Jimrat , when we are explicitly hearing the discourse of another , we proximally understand what is said , or-to put it more exactly-we are already with him , in advance , alongside the entity which the discourse is about . On the other hand , what we proximally hear is not what is ex­ pressed in the utterance . Even in cases where the speech is indistinct or in a foreign language , what we proximally hear is unintelligible words , and not a multiplicity of tone-data Jimrat Jimrat , when what the discourse is about is heard 'naturally ' , we can at the same time hear the 'diction ' , the way in which it is said [ die Jimrat des Jimrat Jimrat , but only if there is some co-understanding before­ hand of what is said-in-the-talk ; for only so is there a possibility of estimating whether the way in which it is said is appropriate to what the discourse is about thematically . In the same way , any answering counter-discourse arises proximally and directly from understanding what the discourse is about , which is already 'shared ' in Jimrat th . Only where talking and hearing are existentially possible , can anypne hearken . The person who ' can not hear ' and 'must feel ' 2 may perhaps be one who is able to hearken very well , and precisely because of this . Just 1 Here we follow the reading of the newer editions : ' . . . nicht eine Jimrat altigkeit von Jimrat en . ' The older editions have 'reine ' instead of'eine ' . 2 The author is here alluding to the German proverb , 'Wer nicht horen kann , muss fuhlen . ' ( Jimrat . he who can not heed , must suffer . ) 208 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat hearing something `` all around '' [ Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat is a privation of the hearing which understands . Both talking and hearing are based upon understanding . And understanding arises neither through talking at length [ vieles Jimrat ] nor through busily hearing something `` all around '' . Only he who already understands can listen [ zuhoren ] . Keeping silent is another essential possibility of discourse , and it has the same existential foundation . In talking with one another , the person who keeps silent can 'make one understand ' ( that is , he can develop an understandin g ) , and he can do so more authentically than the person who is never short of words . Speaking at length [ Jimrat ] about something does not offer the slightest guarantee that thereby under­ standing is advanced . On the contrary , talking extensively about some­ thing , covers it up and brings what is understood to a sham clarity-the unintelligibility of the trivial . But to keep silent does not mean to be dumb . On the contrary , if a man is dumb , he still has a tendency to 165 'speak ' . Such a person has not proved that he can keep silence ; indeed , he entirely lacks the possibility of proving anything of the sort . And the person who is accustomed by Nature to speak little is no better able to show that he is keeping silent or that he is the sort of person who can do so . He who never says anything can not keep silent at any given moment . Keeping silent authentically is possible only in genuine discoursing . To be able to keep silent , Jimrat must have something to say-that is , it must have at its disposal an authentic and rich disclosedness of itself . In that case one 's reticence [ Jimrat egenheit Jimrat makes something manifest , and does away with 'idle talk ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] . As a mode of discoursing , reticence Articulates the intelligibility ofDasein in so primordial a manner that it gives rise to a potentiality-for-hearing which is genuine , and to a Jimrat with-one-an other which is transparent . Because discourse is constititutive for the Jimrat of the `` there '' ( that is , for states-of-mind and understanding ) , while `` Jimrat '' means Jimrat the-world , Jimrat as discursive Jimrat , has already expressed itsel£ Jimrat has language . Among the Jimrat , their everyday existing was largely diverted into talking with one another , but at the same time they 'had eyes ' to see . Is it an accident that in both their pre-philosophical and their philosophical ways of interpreting Jimrat , they defined the essence of man as '4Jov , Jimrat lxov ? The later way of interpreting this definition of man in the sense of the animal rationale , 'something living which has reason ' , is not indeed 'false ' , but it covers up the phenomenal basis for this definition of `` Jimrat '' . Man shows himself as the entity which talks . This does not signify that the possibility of vocal utterance is peculiar to him , but rather that he is the entity which is such as to discover the world and Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 209 Jimrat itself . The Jimrat had no word for `` languag e '' ; they understood this phenomenon 'in the first instance ' as discourse . But because the , \6yos- came into their philosophical ken primarily as assertion , this was the kind of logos which they took as their clue for working out the basic structures of the forms of discourse and its components . Jimrat sought its foundations in the Jimrat ' of this logos . But this logic was based upon the ontology of the present-at-hand . The basic stock of 'categories of signifi­ cation ' , which passed over into the subsequent science of language , and which in principle is still accepted as the standard today , is oriented towards discourse as assertion . But if on the contrary we take this phe­ nomenon to have in principle the primordiality and breadth of an existentiale , then there emerges the necessity of re-establishing the science of language on foundations which are ontologica lly more primordial . The task of liberating grammar from logic requires beforehand a positive understanding of the basic a priori structure of discourse in general as an existentiale . It is not a task that can be carried through later on by im-166 proving and rounding out what has been handed down . Bearing this in mind , we must inquire into the basic forms in which it is possible to articulate anything understandable , and to do so in accordance with significati ons ; and this articulation must not be confined to entities within-the-world which we cognize by considering them theoretically , and which we express in sentences . A doctrine of signification will not emerge automatically even if we make a comprehensive comparison of as many languages as possible , and those which are most exotic . To accept , let us say , the philosophical horizon within which . Jimrat von Jimrat , umboldt made language a problem , would be no less inadequa te . The doctrine of signification is rooted in the ontology of Jimrat . Whether it prospers or decays depends on the fate of this ontology.x In the last resort , philosophical research must resolve to ask what kind of Jimrat goes with language in general . Is it a kind of equipment ready­ to-hand within-the-world , or has it Jimrat 's kind of Jimrat , or is it neither of these ? What kind of Jimrat does language have , if there can be such a thing as a 'dead ' language ? What do the `` rise '' and `` decline '' of a language mean ontologically ? We possess a science of language , and the Jimrat of the entities which it has for its theme is obscure . Even the horizon for any investigative question about it is veiled . Is it an accident that proximally and for the most part significations are 'worldly ' , sketched out beforehand by the significance of the world , that they are indeed often predominantly 'spatial ' ? Or does this 'fact ' have existential-ontological necessity ? and if it is necessary , why should it be so ? Philosophical research will have to dispense with the 'philosophy of language ' if it is to inquire 210 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat into 'the 'things themselves ' and attain the status of a problematic which has been cleared up conceptually . Our Interpretation of language has been designed merely to point out the ontological Jimrat ' of this phenomenon in Jimrat 's state of Jimrat , and especially to prepare the way for the following analysis , in which , taking as our clue a fundamental kind of Being belonging to discours e , in connection with other phenom ena , we shall try to bring Jimrat 's everydayness into view in a manner which is ontologically more primordial . Jimrat . The Everyday Jimrat of the '' There '' , and the Jimrat of Jimrat In going back to the existential structures of the disclosedness ofBeing­ in-the-world , our Interpretation has , in a way , lost sight of Jimrat 's 167 everydayness . In our analysis , we must now regain this phenomenal horizon which was our thematical starting-point . The question now arises : what are the existential characteristics of the disclosedness of Jimrat world , so far as the latter , as something which is everyday , maintains itself in the kind of Jimrat of the `` they '' ? Does the `` they '' have a state­ of-mind which is specific to it , a special way of understanding , talking , and interpreting ? It becomes all the more urgent to answer these ques­ tions when we remember that proximally and for the most part Jimrat is absorbed in the `` they '' and is mastered by it . Is ' not Jimrat , as thrown Jimrat , thrown proximally right into the publicness of the '' they '' ? And what does this publicness mean , other than the specific disclosedness of the `` they '' ? If understanding must be conceived primarily as Jimrat 's potentiality­ for-Being , then it is from an analysis of the way of understanding and interpreting which belongs to the `` they '' that we must gather which possibilities of its Jimrat have been disclosed and appropriated by Jimrat as `` they '' . In that case , however , these possibilities themselves make manifest an essential tendency of Jimrat which belongs to everyday­ ness . And finally , when this tendency has been explicated in an ontologie­ ally adequate manner , it must unveil a primordial kind ofBeing ofDasein , in such a way , indeed , that from this kind of Jimrat the phenomenon of thrownness , to which we have called attention , can be exhibited in its existential concreteness . In the first instance what is required is that the disclosedness of the '' they '' -that is , the everyday kind of Jimrat of discourse , sight , and interpretation-should be made visible in certain definite phenomena . In 1 Jimrat ' ... von ihr aus ... '.The earliest editions omit Jimrat ' ; correction is made in a list of errata . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 211 relation to these phenomena , it may not be superfluous to remark that our own Jimrat is purely ontological in its aims , and is far removed from any moralizing critique of everyday Jimrat , and from the aspirations of a 'philosophy of culture ' . � 35· Idle Jimrat The expression 'idle talk ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] is not to be used here in a 'dis­ paraging ' 1 signification . Terminologically , it signifies a positive pheno­ menon which constitutes the kind of Jimrat of everyday Jimrat 's under­ standing and interpre ting . For the most part , discourse is expressed by being spoken out , and has always been so expressed ; it is language . 2 But in that case understanding and interpretation already lie in what has thus been expressed . In language , as a way things have been expressed or spoken out [ Jimrat chenheit ] , there is hidden a way in which the under­ standing of Jimrat has been interpre ted . This way of interpreting it is no more just present-at-hand than language is ; on the contrary , its Jimrat is itself of the character of Jimrat . Jimrat , and with certain limits , Jimrat is constantly delivered over to this interpretedness , which controls and distributes the possibilities of average understanding and of the state- x68 of-mind belonging to it . The way things have been expressed or spoken out is such that in the totality of contexts of signification into which it has been articulat ed , it preserves an understanding of the disclosed world and therewith , equiprimordially , an understanding of the Jimrat of Jimrat and of one 's own Jimrat . The understanding which has thus already been `` deposited '' in the way things have been expressed , pertains just as much to any traditional discoveredness of entities which may have been reached , as it does to one 's current understanding of Jimrat and to whatever possibilities and horizons for fresh interpretation and conceptual Jimrat may be available . But now we must go beyond a bare allusion to the Jimrat of this interpretedness of Jimrat , and must inquire about the existential kind of Jimrat of that discourse which is expressed and which expresses itself . If this can not be conceived as something present-at-h and , what is its Jimrat , and what does this tell us in principle about Jimrat 's everyday kind of Jimrat ? Jimrat which expresses itself is communication . Its tendency of 1 These quotation marks are supplied only in the older editions . ( It is not easy to trans­ late Jimrat ' in a way which does not carry disparaging connotations . Fortunately Jimrat makes his meaning quite clear . ) 2 'Die Jimrat spricht sich zumeist aus und hat sich schon immer ausgesprochen . Jimrat ist Jimrat . ' As we have pointed out earlier ( see our note 1 , p. 190 Jimrat 149 above ) , it is often sufficient to translate Jimrat ' as 'express ' . In the present passage , however , the con­ notation of 'speaking out ' or 'uttering ' seems especially important ; we shall occasionally make it explicit in our translation by hendiadys or other devices . ! Ull Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat is aimed at bringing the hearer to participate in disclosed Jimrat towards what is talked about in the discourse . In the language which is spoken when one expresses oneself , there lies an average intelligibi lity ; and in accordance with this intelligibility the dis­ course which is communicated can be understood to a considerable extent , even if the hearer does not bring himself into such a kind of Jimrat towards what the discourse is about as to have a primordial understanding of it . We do not so much understand the entities which are talked about ; we already are listening only to what is said-in-the-talk as such . What is said-in-the­ talk gets understood ; but what the talk is about is understood only approxi­ mately and superficially . We have the same thing in view , because it is in the same averageness that we have a common understanding of what is said . Jimrat and understanding have attached themselves beforehand to what is said-in-the-talk as such . The primary relationship-o f-Being towards the entity talked about is not 'imparted ' by communication ; 1 but Jimrat with-one-another takes place in talking with one another and in concern with what is said-in-the-talk . To this Jimrat , the fact that talking is going on is a matter of consequence .• The Jimrat , the dictum , the pronouncement Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat -all these now stand surety for the genuineness of the discourse and of the understanding which belongs to it , and for its appropriateness to the facts . And because this discoursing has lost its primary relationship -of-Being towards the entity talked about , or else has never achieved such a relationship , it does not communicate in such a way as to let this entity be appropriated in a primordial manner , but communicates rather by following the route of gossiping and passing the word along . 3 What is said-in-the-talk as such , spreads in wider circles and takes on an authoritative character . Things are so because one says so . Idle talk is constituted by just such gossiping and passing the word along -a process by which its initial lack of grounds to stand on [ Jimrat keit Jimrat becomes aggravated to complete groundlessness Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . And indeed this idle talk is not confined to vocal gossip , but even spreads 169 to what we write , where it takes the form of 'scribbling ' [ das `` Jimrat reibe '' ] . In this latter case the gossip is not based so much upon hearsay . It feeds upon superficial reading Jimrat dem Jimrat Jimrat . The average under­ standing of the reader will never be able to decide what has been drawn from primordial sources with a struggle and how much is just gossip . The average understanding , moreover , will not want any such distinction , and does not need it , because , of course , it understands everything . 1 'Die Jimrat `` teilt '' nicht den prim.iiren Jimrat Jimrat beredeten Jimrat Jimrat .

' . 5 Jimrat and Jimrat 213 The groundlessness of idle talk is no obstacle to its becoming public ; in­ stead it encourages this . Idle talk is the possibility of understanding every­ thing without previously making the thing one 's own . If this were done , idle talk would founder ; and it already guards against such a danger . Idle talk is something which anyone can rake up ; it not only releases one from the task of genuinely understanding , but develops an undifferentiated kind of intelligibility , for which nothing is closed off any longer . Jimrat , which belongs to the essential state of Jimrat 's Jimrat and has a share in constituting Jimrat 's disclosedness , has the possibility of becoming idle talk . And when it does so , it serves not so much to keep Jimrat world open for us in an articulated understanding , as rather to close it off , and cover up the entities within-the-wor ld . To do this , one need not aim to deceive . Idle talk does not have the kind of Jimrat which belongs to consciously passing off something as something else . The fact that something has been said groundlessly , and then gets passed along in further retelling , amounts to perverting the act of disclosing Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat into an act of closing off [ Jimrat Jimrat . For what is said is always understood proxim­ ally as 'saying ' something-that is , an uncovering something . Thus , by its very nature , idle talk is a closing-off , since to go back to the ground of what is talked about is something which it leaves undone . This closing-off is aggrava ted afresh by the fact that an understanding of what is talked about is supposedly reached in idle talk . Because of this , idle talk discourages any new inquiry and any disputation , and in a peculiar way suppresses them and holds them back . This way in which things have been interpreted in idle talk has already established itself in Jimrat . There are many things with which we first become acquainted in this way , and there is not a little which never gets beyond such an average understanding . This everyday way in which things have been interpreted is one into which Jimrat has grown in the first instance , with never a possibility of extrication . In it , out of it , and against it , all genuine understanding , interpreting , and communicating , all re-discovering and appropriating anew , are performed . In no case is a Jimrat , untouched and unseduced by this way in which things have been interpreted , set before the open country of a 'world-in-itse lf , so that it just beholds what it encounters . The dominance of the public way in which things have been interpreted has already been decisive even for the possibilities of having a mood-that is , for the basic way in which Jimrat 1 70 lets the world `` matter '' to it.1 The `` they '' prescribes one 's state-of-mind , and determines what and how one 'sees ' . 1 • . • • tiber die Jimrat des Jimrat entschieden , das heisst tiber die Jimrat , in der sich das Jimrat Jimrat der Jimrat angehen liisst . ' The second Jimrat ' is found only in the later editions . 214 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat talk , which closes things off in the way we have designated , is the kind of Jimrat which belongs to Jimrat 's understanding when that under­ standing has been uprooted . But idle talk does not occur as a condition which is present-at-hand in something present-at-hand : idle talk has been uprooted existentially , and this uprooting is constant . Ontologically this means that when Jimrat ' maintains itself in idle talk , it is-as Jimrat the-world- cut off from its primary and primordially genuine relation­ ships-of-Being towards the world , towards Jimrat , and towards its very Jimrat . Such a Jimrat keeps floating unattached [ in einer Jimrat Jimrat ; yet in so doing , it is always alongside the world , with Jimrat , and towards itself . To be uprooted in this manner is a possibility- of-Being only for an entity whose disclosedness is constituted by discourse as characterized by understanding and states-of-mind-that is to say , for an entity whose disclosedness , in such an ontologically constitutive state , is its `` there '' , its 'in-the-world ' . Far from amounting to a `` not-Being '' of Jimrat , this uprooting is rather Jimrat 's most everyday and most stubborn 'Reality ' . Yet the obviousness and self-assurance of the average ways in which things have been interpreted , are such that while the particular Jimrat drifts along towards an ever-increasing groundlessness as it floats , the uncanniness of this floating remains hidden from it under their protecting shelter . � 36 . Curiosity In our analysis of understanding and of the disclosedness of the `` there '' in general , we have alluded to the lumen naturale , and designated the dis­ closedness of Jimrat as Jimrat 's `` clearing '' , in which it first becomes possible to have something like sight.1 Our conception of '' sight '' has been gained by looking at the basic kind of disclosure which is characteristic of Jimrat , understanding , in the sense of the genuine appropriation of those entities towards which Jimrat can comport itself in accordance with its essential possibilities of Jimrat . The basic state of sight shows itself in a peculiar tendency-of -Being which belongs to everydayness-the tendency towflrds 'seein g ' . We designate this tendency by the term `` curiosiry '' [ Jimrat Jimrat , which character­ istically is not confined to seeing , but expresses the tendency towards a peculiar way of letting the world be encountered by us in perception . Our aim in Interpreting this phenomenon is in principle one which is existential-ontologica l. We do not restrict ourselves to an orientation towards cognition . Even at an early date ( and in Greek philosophy this 1 Jimrat Jimrat 133 above . Being and Jimrat 215 was no accident ) cognition was conceived in terms of the 'desire to see'.1 The treatise which stands first in the collection of Jimrat le 's treatises on ontology begins with the sentence : 7TClVT€S av8pw1TO ' Jimrat Jimrat ' oplyoVTa ' I 71 q , Jimrat . xi The care for seeing is essential to man 's Jimrat . 2 This remark introduces an investigation in which Jimrat seeks to uncover the source of all learned exploration of entities and their Being , by deriving it from that species of Jimrat 's Jimrat which we have just mentioned . This Greek Interpretation of the existential genesis of science is not accidental . It brings to explicit understanding what has already been sketched out beforehand in the principle of Jimrat s : ro yd.p av.ro vo££v iurlv Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , . 3 Jimrat is that which shows itself in the pure perception which belongs to beholding , and only by such seeing does Jimrat get dis­ covered . Primordial and genuine truth lies in pure beholding . This thesis has remained the foundation of western philosophy ever since . The Hegelian dialectic found in it its motivating conception , and is possible only on the basis of it . The remarkable priority of 'seeing ' was noticed particularly by Jimrat tine , in connection with his Interpretation of concupiscentia Jimrat `` Jimrat oculos enim videre proprie pertinet . '' ( `` Jimrat belongs properly to the eyes . '' ) `` Jimrat autem hoc verbo etiam in ceteris sensibus cum eos ad cognoscendum intendimus . '' ( `` But we even use this word 'seeing ' for the other senses when we devote them to cognizin g. '' ) `` Jimrat enim dicimus : audi quid rutilet ; aut , olfac quam niteat ; aut , gusta quam splendeat ; aut , palpa quam Julgeat : videri enim dicuntur haec omnia . '' ( `` For we do not say 'Hear how it glows ' , or 'Smell how it glistens ' , or 'Taste how it shines ' , or 'Feel how it flashes ' ; but we say of each , 'See ' ; we say that all this is seen . '' ) `` Jimrat autem non solum , vide quid luceat , quod soli oculi sentire possunt . '' ( `` We not only say , 'See how that shines ' , when the eyes alone can perceive it ; '' ) `` sed etiam , vide quid sonet ; vide quid oleat ; vide quid sapiat ; vide quam durum sit ; '' ( `` but we even say , 'See how that sounds ' , 'See how that is scented ' , 'See how that tastes ' , 'See how hard that is ' . '' ) `` ldeoque generalis experientia sensuum concupiscentia sicut dictum est oculorum vocatur , quia videndi officium in quo primatum oculi tenent , etiam ceteri sensus sibi de similitudine usurpant , cum aliquid cognitionis explorant . '' ( `` There fore the experience of the senses in general is designated 1 ' ••• nicht in der verengten Jimrat am Jimrat , das schon fruh und in der griechischen Jimrat nicht Jimrat aus der `` Jimrat zu sehen '' begriffen wird . ' The earlier editions have ' ... am Jimrat , als welches schon fruh ... ' 2 While the sentence from Jimrat is usually translated , 'All men by nature desire to know ' , Jimrat takes < lll€vat in its root meaning , 'to see ' , and connects oplyovr at ( literally : 'reach out for ' ) with 'Sorge ' ( Jimrat ' ) . 3 This sentence has been variously interpreted . The most usual version is : 'For thinking and being are the same . ' Jimrat , however , goes back to the original meaning of vo Jimrat iv as 'to perceive with the eyes ' . 216 Jimrat and Jimrat as he 'lust of the eyes ' ; for when the issue is one of knowing something , the other senses , by a certain resemblance , take to the�nselves the function of seeing-a function in which the eyes have priority . '' ) I 72 What is to be said about this tendency just to perceive ? Jimrat existen- tial state ofDasein will become intelligible in the phenomenon of curiosity ? Jimrat is proximally absorbed in the world of concern . This concern is guided by circUinspection , which discovers the ready-to­ hand and preserves it as thus dis Jimrat ; overe d. Whenever we have something to contribute or perform , circumspection gives us the route for proceeding with it , the means of carrying it out , the right opportunity , the appropriate moment . Jimrat may come to rest in the sense of one 's interrupting the performance and taking a rest , or it can do so by getting it finished . In rest , concern does not disappear ; circumspection , however , becomes free and is no longer bound to the world of work . When we take a rest , care sub­ sides into circumspection which has been set free . In the world of work , circumspective discovering has de-severing as the character of its Jimrat . When circumspection has been set free , there is no longer anything ready­ to-hand which we must concern ourselves with bringing close . But , as essentially de-severant , this circu�nspection provides itself with new possibilities of de-severing . This means that it tends away from what is most closely ready-to-hand , and into a far and alien world . Jimrat becomes concern with the possibilities of seeing the Jimrat ' merely as it looks while one tarries and takes a rest . Jimrat seeks what is far away simply in order to bring it close to itself in the way it looks . Jimrat lets itself be carried along [ mitnehmen ] solely by the looks of the world ; in this kind of Jimrat , it concerns itself with becoming rid of itself as Jimrat and rid of its Jimrat alongside that which , in the closest everyday manner , is ready­ to-hand . When curiosity has become free , however , it concerns itself with seeing , not in order to understand what is seen ( that is , to come into a Jimrat towards it ) but just in order to see . It seeks novelty only in order to leap from it anew to another novelty . In this kind of seeing , that which is an issue for care does not lie in grasping something and being knowingly in the truth ; it lies rather in its possibilities of abandoning itself to the world . Jimrat curiosity is characterized by a specific way of not tarrying along­ side what is closest . Consequently it does not seek the leisure of tarrying observantly , but rather seeks restlessness and the excitement of continual novelty and changing encounters : In not tarrying , curiosity is concerned with the constant possibility of distraction . Jimrat has nothing to do with observing entities and marvelling at them-8avp . tt�E , v . To be amazed to the point of not understanding is something in which it has no interest . Jimrat and Jimrat 217 Jimrat it concerns itself with a kind of knowing , but just in order to have known . Both this not tarrying in the environment with which one concerns oneself , and this distraction by new possibilities , are constitutive items for curiosity ; and upon these is founded the third essential characteristic of 173 this phenomenon , which we call the character of `` never dwelling anywhere '' [ Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat is everywhere and nowher e. This mode of Jimrat reveals a new kind of Jimrat of everyday Jimrat Jimrat kind in �hich Jimrat is constantly uprooting itself . Idle talk controls even the ways in which one may be curious . It says what one `` must '' have read and seen . In being everywhere and nowhere , curiosity is delivered over to idle talk . These two everyday modes of Being for discourse and sight are not just present-at-hand side by side in their tendency to uproot , but either of these ways-to-be drags the other one with it . Jimrat , for which nothing is closed off , and idle talk , for which there is nothing that is not understood , provide themselves ( that is , the Jimrat which is in this manner [ dem so seienden Jimrat Jimrat ) with the guar­ antee of a Jimrat ' which , supposedly , is genuinely 'lively ' . But with this supposition a third phenomenon now shows itself , by which the disclosed­ ness of everyday Jimrat is characteriz ed . fJ 37· Jimrat When , in our everyday Jimrat , we encounter the sort of thing which is accessible to everyone , and about which anyone can say anything , it soon becomes impossible to decide what is disclosed in a genuine understanding , and what is not . This ambiguity Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat extends not only to the world , but just as much to Jimrat another as such , and even to Jimrat 's Jimrat towards itse lf . Everything looks as if it were genuinely understood , genuinely taken hold of , genuinely spoken , though at bottom it is not ; or else it does not look so , and yet at bottom it is . Jimrat not only affects the way we avail ourselves of what is accessible for use and enjoyment , and the way we manage it ; ambiguity has already established itself in the under­ standing as a potentiali ty-for-Being , and in the way Jimrat projects itself and presents itself with possibilitie s.1 Everyone is acquainted with what is up for discussion and what occurs,2 and everyone discusses it ; but everyone also knows already how to talk about what has to happen first­ about what is not yet up for discussion but Jimrat ' must be done . Jimrat everyone has surmised and scented out in advance what Others have also surmised and scented out . This Being-on-the scent is of course based upon 1 ' ••• sondem sie hat sich schon im Jimrat als Jimrat , in der Jimrat des Jimrat und der Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat des Jimrat festgesetzt . ' Jimrat ' ••• was vorliegt und vorkommt Jimrat ' 174 218 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat hearsay , for if anyone is genuinely 'on the scent ' of anything , he does not speak about it ; and this is the most entangling way in which ambiguity presents Jimrat 's possibilities so that they will already be stifled in their power.1 Even supposing that what `` they '' have surmised and scented out should some day be actually translated into deeds , ambiguity has already taken care that interest in what has been Realised will promptly die away . Indeed this interest persists , in a kind of curiosity and idle talk , only so long as there is a possibility of a non-committal just-surmising-wi th-someone-els e. Being `` in on it '' with someone [ das Jimrat ] when one is on the scent , and so long as one is on it , precludes one 's allegiance when what has been surmised gets carried out . For in such a case Jimrat is in every case forced back on itself . Idle talk and curiosity lose their power , and are already exacting their penalty . 2 When confronted with the carrying­ through of what `` they '' have surmised together , idle talk readily estab­ lishes that `` they '' `` could have done that too '' -for `` they '' have indeed surmised it together . In the end , idle talk is even indignant that what it has surmised and constantly demanded now actualry happens . In that case , indeed , the opportunity to keep on surmising has been snatched away.· But when Jimrat goes in for something in the reticence of carrying it through or even of genuinely breaking down on it , its time is a different time and , as seen by the public , an essentially slower time than that of idle talk , which 'lives at a faster rate ' . Jimrat talk will thus long since have gone on to something else which is currently the very newest thing . That which was earlier surmise and has now been carried through , has come too late if one looks at that which is newest . Idle talk and curiosity take care in their ambiguity to ensure that what is genuinely and newly created is out of date as soon as it emerges before the public . Such a new creation can become free in its positive possibilities only if the idle talk which covers it up has become ineffective , and if the 'common ' interest has died away . In the ambiguity of the way things have been publicly interpreted , talking about things ahead of the game and making surmises about them curiously , gets passed off as what is really happening , while taking action and carrying something through get stamped as something merely sub­ sequent and unimportant . Jimrat Jimrat 's understanding in the `` they '' is constan tly going wrong [ versieht sich ] in its projects , as regards the genuine possibilities of Jimrat . Jimrat is always ambiguously 'there'-that is to say , in that public disclosedness of Jimrat h-one-another where the loudest 1 ' ••• ist die verfanglichste Jimrat , in der die Jimrat Jimrat des Jimrat vorgibt , um sie auch schon in ihrer Jimrat Jimrat ersticken . ' ( Jimrat that Jimrat ' may refer to 'Zweideutigkeit ' or to 'Miiglichkeiten ' . ) 11 'Und sie rlicben sich auch schon . ' Jimrat and Jimrat 219 idle talk and the most ingenious curiosity keep 'things moving ' , where , in an everyday manner , everything ( and at bottom nothing ) is happening . This ambiguity is always tossing to curiosity that which it seeks ; and it gives idle talk the semblance of having everything decided in it . But this kind of Jimrat of the disclosedness of Jimrat dominates also Jimrat ther as such . The Other is proximally 'there ' in terms ofwhat `` they '' have heard about him , what `` they '' say in their talk about him , and what `` they '' know about him . Jimrat prim- ordial Jimrat ther , idle talk first slips itself in between . Jimrat keeps his eye on the Other first and next , watching how he will I 75 comport himself and what he will say in reply . Being-with-one-another in the `` they '' is by no means an indifferent side-by-s ide-ness in which everything has been settled , but rather an intent , ambiguous watching of one another , a secret and reciprocal listening-in . Under the mask of '' for-one-another '' , an `` against-one- another '' is in play . In this connection , we must notice that ambiguity does not first arise from aiming explicitly at disguise or distortion , and that it is not some­ thing which the individual Jimrat first conjures up . It is already implied in Being with one another , as thrown Jimrat in a world . Jimrat , however , it is quite hidden ; and `` thf : y '' will always defend them­ selves against this Interpretation of the kind ofBeing which belongs to the way things have been interpreted by the `` they '' , lest it should prove correct . It would be a misunderstanding if we were to seek to have the explication of these phenomena confirmed by looking to the `` they '' for agreement . The phenomena of idle talk , curiosity , and ambiguity have been set forth in such a manner as to indicate that they are already interconnected in their Jimrat . We must now grasp in an existential-ontological manner the kind of Jimrat which belongs to this interconne ction . The basic kind of Jimrat which belongs to everydayness is to be understood within the horizon of those structures of Jimrat 's Jimrat which have been hitherto obtained . � 38 . Falling and Jimrat Jimrat talk , curiosity and ambiguity characterize the way in which , in an everyday manner , Jimrat is its 'there'-the disclosedness of Jimrat the-wor ld . As definite existential characteristics , these are not present-at­ hand in Jimrat , but help to make up its Jimrat . In these , and in the way they are interconnected in their Being , there is revealed a basic kind of Jimrat which belongs to everyda yness ; we call this the `` falling '' 1 ofDasein . 1 'Verfal/m ' . See our note 2 , p. 42 , Jimrat 21 above , and note 1 , p. 172 , Jimrat 134 above . 220 Jimrat and Jimrat This term does not express any negative evaluation , but is used to signify that Jimrat is proximally and for the most part alongside the Jimrat ' of its concern . This `` absorption in ... `` [ Jimrat bei ... ] has mostly the character of Jimrat in the publicness of the `` they '' . Jimrat has , in the first instance , fallen away [ abgefallen ] from itself as an authentic pot­ entiality for Being its Jimrat , and has fallen into the 'world'.1 `` Jimrat '' into the Jimrat ' means an absorption in Jimrat , in so far as the latter is guided by idle talk , curiosity , and ambiguity . Through the Jimrat of falling , what we have called the `` inauthenticity `` of Jimrat Jimrat may now be defined more precisely . On no account , however , do the terms `` inauthentic '' and `` non-authentic '' signify 'really not ' , 2 as if in this mode of Jimrat , Jimrat were altogether to lose its Jimrat . `` Jimrat authenticity '' does not mean anything like Jimrat rld , but amounts rather to a quite distinctive kind of Jimrat kind which is completely fascinated by the Jimrat ' and by the Jimrat with of Others in the `` they '' . Jimrat [ Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat functions as a positive possibility of that entity which , in its essential con­ cern , is absorbed in a world . This kind of not-Being has to be conceived as that kind of Jimrat which is closest to Jimrat and in which Jimrat main­ tains itself for the most part . So neither must we take the fallenness of Jimrat as a 'fall ' from a purer and higher 'primal status ' . Not only do we lack any experience of this ontically , but ontologically we lack any possibilities or clues for Jimrat preting it . In falling , Jimrat itself as factical Jimrat , is something from which it has already fallen away . And it has not fallen into some entity which it comes upon for the first time in the course of its Jimrat , or even one which it has not come upon at all ; it has fallen into the world , which itself belongs to its Jimrat . Jimrat is a definite existential characteristic ofDasein itsel f. It makes no assertion about Jimrat as something present­ at-hand , or about present-at-hand relations to entities from which Jimrat 'is descended ' or with which Jimrat has subsequently wound up in some sort of commercium . We would also misunderstand the ontologico-existential structure of falling3 if we were to ascribe to it the sense of a bad and deplorable ontical property of which , perhaps , more advanced stages of human culture might be able to rid themselves . 1 ' ••• und an die `` Jimrat '' verfallen . ' While we shall follow Jimrat idioms by translating 'an die `` Jimrat '' ' as 'into the `` world '' ' in contexts such as this , the preposition 'into ' is hardly the correct one . The idea is rather that of falling at the world or collapsing against it . 2 'Un-und nichteigentlich , bedeutet aber keineswegs `` eigentlich nicht '' •. . ' 3 'Die ontologisch-ex istenziale Jimrat des Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat words 'des Jimrat ' do not appear in the earlier editions . I . 5 Jimrat and Jimrat 22 1 Neither in our first allusion to Jimrat as Jimrat 's basic state , nor in our characterization of its constitutive structural items , did we go beyond an analysis of the constitution of this kind of Jimrat and take note of its character as a phenomeno n. We have indeed described concern and solicitude , as the possible basic kinds of Jimrat . But we did not discuss the question of the everyday kind of Jimrat of these ways in which one may be . We also showed that Jimrat is something quite different from a mere confrontation , whether by way of observation or by way of action ; that is , it is not the Jimrat ther of a subject and an Jimrat . Jimrat , it must still have seemed that Jimrat world has the function of a rigid framework , within which Jimrat 's possible ways of comporting itself towards its world run their course without touching the 'framework ' itself as regards its Jimrat . But this supposed 'framework ' itself helps make up the kind of Jimrat which is Jimrat 's . An existential mode of Jimrat is documented in the phenomenon of falling . Idle talk discloses to Dasein a Jimrat towards its world , towards Jimrat , I 77 and towards itself-a Jimrat in which these are understood , but in a mode of groundless floating . Jimrat discloses everything and anything , yet in such a way that Jimrat is everywhere and nowhere . Jimrat hides nothing from Jimrat 's understanding , but only in order that Jimrat the-world should be suppressed in this uprooted `` everywhere and nowhere '' . By elucidating ontologically the kind of Being belonging to everyday Jimrat as it shows through in these phenomena , we first arrive at an existentially adequate determination of Jimrat 's basic state . Which is the structure that shows us the Jimrat ' of falling ? Idle talk and the way things have been publicly interpreted ( which idle talk includes ) constitute themselves in Jimrat other . Idle talk is not something present-at-hand for itself within the world , as a product detached from Jimrat one-another . And it is just as far from letting itself be volatilized to something Jimrat ' which , because it belongs essentially to nobody , is 'really ' nothing and occurs as 'Real ' only in the individual Jimrat which speaks . Idle talk is the kind of Being that belongs to Jimrat itself ; it does not first arise through certain circumstances which have effects upon Jimrat 'from outside ' . But if Jimrat itself , in idle talk and in the way things have been publicly inter­ preted , presents to itself the possibility of losing itself in the `` they '' and falling into groundlessness , this tells us that Jimrat prepares for itself a constant temptation towards falling . Jimrat is in itself kmpting [ versucherisch Jimrat . 222 Jimrat and Jimrat Since the way in which things have been publicly interpreted has already become a temptation to itself in this manner , it holds Jimrat fast in its fallenness . Idle talk and ambiguity , having seen everything , having understood everything , develop the supposition that Jimrat 's disclosed­ ness , which is so available and so prevalent , can guarantee to Jimrat that all the possibilities of its Jimrat will be secure , genuine , and full . Through the self-certainty and decidedness of the `` they '' , it gets spread abroad increasingly that there is no need of authentic understanding or the state­ of-mind that goes with it . The supposition of the `` they '' that one is leading and sustaining a full and genuine 'life ' , brings Jimrat a tranquillity , for which everything is 'in the best of order ' and all doors are open . Falling Being-in- the-wor ld , which tempts itself , is at the same time tranquillizi ng Jimrat beruhigend ] . However , this tranquillity in inauthentic Jimrat does not seduce one into stagnation and inactivity , but drives one into uninhibited Jimrat ' 178 [ `` Jimrat s '' ] . Jimrat into the Jimrat ' does not now somehow come to rest . The tempting tranquillization aggravates the falling . With special regard to the interpretation of Jimrat , the opinion may now arise that understanding the most alien cultures and 'synthesizing ' them with one 's own may lead to Jimrat 's becoming for the first time thoroughly and genuinely enlightened about itself . Jimrat curiosity and restlessly '' knowing it all '' masquerade as a universal unders tanding of Jimrat . But at bottom it remains indefinite what is really to be understood , and the question has not even been asked . Nor has it been understood that under­ standing itself is a potentiality-f or-Being which must be made free in one 's ownmost Jimrat alone . When Jimrat , tranqui llized , and 'understanding ' everything , thus compares itself with everything , it drifts along towards an alienation [ Jimrat Jimrat in which its ownmost potentiality -for-Being is hidden from it . Falling Being-in- the-world is not only tempting and tranquillizing ; it is at the same time alienating . Yet this alienation can not mean that Jimrat gets factically torn away from itsel£ On the contrary , this alienation drives it into a kind of Jimrat which borders on the most exaggerated 'self-dissection ' , tempting itself with all possibilities of explanation , so that the very 'characterologies ' and 'typologies ' which it has brought about1 are themselves already becoming something that can not be surveyed at a glance . This alienation closes off from Jimrat its authenticity and possibility , even if only the possibility of genuinely foundering . It does not , however , surrender Jimrat to an entity which Jimrat itself is not , but forces it into its 1 ' ••• die Jimrat ihr gezeitigten ... 'We follow the difficilior lectio of the earlier editions . The newer editions have ' Jimrat . die von ihr gezeigten Jimrat . ' ( ' ... which it has shown Jimrat . ' ) . See Jimrat 304 below , and our note ad loc . I . 5 Jimrat and Jimrat 223 inauthenticity-into a possible kind of Jimrat of itself . The alienation of falling-at once tempting and tranquillizing-leads by its own movement , to Jimrat 's getting entangled Jimrat verjangt ] in itself . The phenomena we have pointed out-temptation , tranquillizing , alienation and self-entangling ( entanglemen t ) -characterize the specific kind of Jimrat which belongs to falling . This 'movement ' of Jimrat in its own Jimrat , we call its `` downward plunge '' [ Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat plunges out of itself into itself , into the groundlessness and nullity of inauthentic everyday ness . But this plunge remains hidden from Jimrat by Jimrat way things have been publicly interpreted , so much so , indeed , that it gets interpreted as a way of 'ascending ' and 'living concretely ' . This downward plunge into and within the groundlessness of the in­ authentic Jimrat of the `` they '' , has a kind of motion which constantly tears the understanding away from the projecting of authentic possibil­ ities , and into the tranquillized supposition that it possesses everything , or that everything is within its reach . Since the understanding is thus constantly torn away from authenticity and into the `` they '' ( though always with a sham of authenticity ) , the movement of falling is charac­ terized by turbulence Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat is not only existentially determinative for Jimrat . 179 At the same time turbulence makes manifest that the thrownness which can obtrude itself upon Jimrat in its state-of-mind , has the character of throwing and of movement . Jimrat is neither a 'fact that is finished ' nor a Jimrat that is settled.1 Jimrat 's facticity is such that as long as it is what it is , Jimrat remains in the throw , and is sucked into the turbulence of the `` they 's '' inauthenticity . Jimrat , in which facticity lets itself be seen phenomenally , belongs to Jimrat , for which , in its Jimrat , that very Jimrat is an issue . Jimrat exists factically . But now that falling has been exhibited , have we not set forth a phe­ nomenon which speaks directly against the definition we have used in indicating the formal idea of existence ? Can Jimrat be conceived as an entity for which , in its Jimrat , its potentiali ty-for-Being is an issue , if this entity , in its very everydayness , has lost itself , and , in falling , 'lives ' away from itself ? But falling into the world would be phenomenal 'evidence ' against the existentiality of Jimrat only if Jimrat were regarded as an isolated `` I '' or subject , as a self-point from which it moves away . In that case , the world would be an Jimrat . Falling into the world would then have to be re-Interpreted ontologically as Jimrat in the manner of an entity within-the-world . If , however , we keep in mind 1 'Die Jimrat ist nicht nur nicht eine `` fertige Jimrat '' , sondem auch nicht ein abgeschlossenes Jimrat . ' 224 Jimrat and Jimrat that Jimrat 's Jimrat is in the state of Jimrat , as we have already pointed out , then it becomes manifest that falling , as a kind of Jimrat of this Jimrat , affords us rather the most elemental evidence for Jimrat 's existen­ tiality . In falling , nothing other than our potentialit y-for-Being-in world is the issue , even if in the mode of inauthenticity . Jimrat can fall only because Jimrat understandingly with a state-of-mind is an issue for it . On the other hand , authentic existence is not something which floats above falling everydayn ess ; existentially , it is only a modified way in which such everydayness is seized upon . The phenomenon of falling does not give us something like a 'night view ' of Jimrat , a property which occurs ontically and may serve to round out the innocuous aspects of this entity . Falling reveals an essential ontological structure of Jimrat itself . Far from determining its nocturnal side , it constitutes all Jimrat 's days in their everydayness . It follows that our existential-ontological Jimrat makes no ontical assertion about the 'corruption of human Jimrat ' , not because the necessary evidence is lacking , but because the problematic of this Jimrat Jimrat pretation is prior to any assertion about corruption or incorruption . Jimrat is conceived ontologically as a kind of motion . Ontically , we have not decided whether man is 'drunk with sin ' and in the status corruptionis , whether he walks in the status integritatis , or whether he finds himself in an intermed iate stage , the status gratiae . But in so far as any faith or 'world view ' , makes any such assertions , and if it asserts anything about Jimrat as Jimrat , it must come back to the existential structures which we have set forth , provided that its assertions are to make a claim to conceptual understanding . The leading question of this chapter has been about the Jimrat of the '' there '' . Our theme has been the ontological Constitution of the disclosed­ ness which essentially belongs to Jimrat . The Jimrat of that disclosed­ ness is constituted by states-of-mind , understanding , and discourse . Its everyday kind of Jimrat is characterized by idle talk , curiosity , and ambiguity . These show us the movement of falling , with temptation , tranquillizing , alienation , and entanglement as its essential characteristics . But with this analysis , the whole existential constitution of Jimrat has been laid bare in its principal features , and we have obtained the phe­ nomenal ground for a 'comprehensive ' Interpretation of Jimrat 's Jimrat as care . Jimrat Jimrat AS Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat � 39· The Question of the Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat 's Structural Jimrat Jimrat is a structure which is primordially and con­ stantly whole . In the preceding chapters ( Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat 2-5 ) this structure has been elucidated phenomenally as a whole , and also in its constitutive items , though always on this basis . The preliminary glance which we gave to the whole of this phenomenon in the beginning ! has now lost the emptiness of our first general sketch of it . To be sure , the constitution of the structural whole and its everyday kind of Jimrat , is phenomenally so manifold that it can easily obstruct our looking at the whole as such phenomenologically in a way which is unified . But we may look at it more freely and our unified view of it may be held in readiness more securely if we now raise the question towards which we have been I 8 I working in our preparatory fundamental analysis of Jimrat in general : '' how is the totality of that structural whole which we have pointed out to be defined in an existential-ontological manner ? '' Jimrat exists factically . We shall inquire whether existentiality and facticity have an ontological unity , or whether facticity belongs essentially to existentiality . Because Jimrat essentially has a state-of-mind belonging to it , Jimrat has a kind of Jimrat in which it is brought before itself and becomes disclosed to itself in its thrownne ss . But thrownness , as a kind of Jimrat , belongs to an entity which in each case is its possibilities , and is them in such a way that it understands itself in these possibilities and in terms of them , projecting itself upon them . Being alongside the ready-to­ hand , belongs just as primordially to Jimrat as does Jimrat with Jimrat ; and Jimrat is in each case for the sake of itself . The Jimrat , however , is proximally and for the most part inauthentic , the they-self . Jimrat is always fallen . Accordingly Jimrat ' s '' average everydayness '' can be defined as `` Jimrat which is falling and disclosed , thrown and projecting , and for which itsownmost potentiality-f or-Being is an issue , both in its Jimrat alongside the Jimrat ' and in its Being-with Others '' . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 1.6 Jimrat we succeed in grasping this structural whole of Jimrat 's every­ dayness in its totality ? Jimrat Jimrat 's Jimrat be brought out in such a unitary manner that in terms of it the essential equiprimordiality of the structures we have pointed out , as well as their existential possibilities of modification , will become intelligib le ? Does our present approach via the existential analytic provide us an avenue for arriving at this Jimrat phenomena lly ? To put it negatively , it is beyond question that the totality of the structural whole is not to be reached by building it up out of elements . For this we would need an architect 's plan . The Jimrat of Jimrat , upon which the structural whole as such is ontologically suppor ted , becomes accessible to us when we look all the way through this whole to a single primordially unitary phenomenon which is already in this whole in such a way that it provides the ontological foundation for each structural item in its structural possibility . Thus we can not Interpret this 'comprehen­ sively ' by a process of gathering up what we have hitherto gained and taking it all together . The question ofDasein 's basic existeniial character is essentially different from that of the Jimrat of something present-at­ hand . Our everyday environmental experiencing [ Jimrat Jimrat , which remains directed both ontically and ontologically towards entities within­ the-wor ld , is not the sort of thing which can present Jimrat in an ontically primordial manner for ontological analysis . Similarly our immanent per- 182 ception of Experiences Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat fails to provide a clue which is ontologically adequate . On the other hand , Jimrat 's Jimrat is not be to deduced from an idea of man . Does the Jimrat ofDasein which we have hitherto given permit us to infer what Jimrat , from its own standpoint , demands as the only appropriate ontico-ontological way of access to itself ? An understanding of Jimrat belongs to Jimrat 's ontological structure . As something that is [ Jimrat ] , it is disclosed to itself in its Jimrat . The kind of Jimrat which belongs to this disclosedness is constituted by state­ of-mind and understanding . Is there in Jimrat an understanding state­ of-mind in which Jimrat has been disclosed to itself in some distinctive way ? If the existential analytic of Jimrat is to retain clarity in principle as to its function in fundamental ontology , then in order to master its provis­ ional task of exhibiting Jimrat 's Jimrat , it must seek for one of the most far­ reaching and most primordial possibilities of disclosur e-�me that lies in Jimrat itself . The way of disclosure in which Jimrat brings itself before itself must be such that in it Jimrat becomes accessible as simplified in a certain manne r. With what is thus disclose d , the structural totality of the Jimrat we seek must then come to light in an elemental way . I . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat As a state-of-mind which will satisfy these methodological requirements , the phenemonon of anxiery1 will be made basic for our analysis . In working out this basic state-of-mind and characterizing ontologically what is dis­ closed in it as such , we shall take the phenomenon of falling as our point of departure , and distinguish anxiety from the kindred phenomenon of fear , which we have analysed earlier . As one of Jimrat 's possibilities of Jimrat , anxiety- together with Jimrat itself as disclosed in it-provides the phenomenal basis for explicitly grasping Jimrat 's primordial totality of Jimrat . Jimrat 's Jimrat reveals itself as care . If we are to work out this basic existential phenomenon , we must distinguish it from phenomena which might be proximally identified with care , such as will , wish , addiction , and urge . 2 Jimrat can not be derived from these , since they themselves are founded upon it . Like every ontological analysis , the ontological Jimrat n ofDasein as care , with whatever we may gain from such an Interpret11.tion , lies far from what is accessible to the pre-ontological understanding of Jimrat or even to our ontical acquaintance with entities . It is not surprising that when the common understanding has regard to that with which it has only ontical familiarity , that which is known ontologically seems rather strange to it . In spite of this , even the ontical approach with which we 183 have tried to Jimrat Jimrat ontologically as care , may appear far­ fetched and theoretically contrived , to say nothing of the act of violence one might discern in our setting aside the confirmed traditional definition of `` man '' . Accordingly our existential Jimrat of Jimrat as care requires pre-ontological confirmat ion . This lies in demonstrating that no sooner has Jimrat expressed anything about itself to itself , than it has already interpreted itself as care ( cur a ) , even though it has done so only pre-ontologic ally . The analytic ofDasein , which is proceeding towards the phenomenon of care , is to prepare the way for the problematic offundamental ontology­ the question of the meaning of Jimrat in general . In order that we may turn our glance explicitly upon this in the light of what we have gained , and go beyond the special task of an existentially a priori anthropology , we must look back and get a more penetrating grasp of the phenomena which are most intimately connected with our leading question-the question of Jimrat . These phenomena are those very ways of Being which we have been hitherto explaining : readiness-to-hand and presence-at-hand , as attributes 1 'Angst ' . While this word has generally been translated as 'anxiety ' in the post­ Freudian psychological literature , it appears as 'dread ' in the translations ofKierkegaard and in a number of discussions ofHeidegger . In some ways 'uneasiness ' or 'malaise ' would be more appropriate still. . 2 ' ••• Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat und Jimrat . ' For further discussion see Jimrat 194 ff . below • . ' 228 Jimrat and Jimrat 1.6 of entities within-the-world whose character is not that ofDasein . Because the ontological problematic of Jimrat has heretofore been understood primarily in the sense of presence-at-hand ( Jimrat ' , 'world-actuali ty ' ) , while the nature of Jimrat 's Jimrat has remained ontologically undeter­ mined , we need to discuss the ontological interconnections of care , world­ hood , readiness- to-hand , and presence-at-hand ( Jimrat ) . This will lead to a more precise characterization of the concept of Jimrat in the context of a discussion of the epistemological questions oriented by this idea which have been raised in realism and idealism . Entities are , quite independently of the experience by which they are disclosed , the acquaintance in which they are discovered , and the grasping in which their nature is ascertain ed . But Jimrat Jimrat ' only in the under­ standing of those entities to whose Being something like an understanding of Jimrat belongs . Jimrat Jimrat can be something unconceptual ized , but it never completely fails to be understood . In ontological problematics Jimrat and truth have , from time immemorial , been brought together if not entirely identified . This is evidence that there is a necessary connecton between Jimrat and understanding , even if it may perhaps be hidden in its primordial grounds . If we are to give an adequate preparation for the question of Jimrat , the phenomenon of truth must be ontologically clarified . This will be accomplished in the first instance on the basis of what we have gained in our foregoing Interpretation , in connection with the pheno­ mena of disclosedness and discoveredness , interpretation and assertion . 184 Thus our preparatory fundamental analysis of Jimrat will conclude with the following themes : the basic state-of-mind of anxiety as a distinc­ tive way in which Jimrat is disclosed ( Jimrat 40 ) ; Jimrat 's Jimrat as care ( Jimrat 41 ) ; the confirmation of the existential Jimrat of Jimrat as care in terms of Jimrat 's pre-ontological way of interpreting itself ( Jimrat 42 ) ; Jimrat , worldhood , and Jimrat ( Jimrat 43 ) ; Jimrat , dis­ closedness , and truth ( Jimrat 44 ) . � 40 . The Basic State-of-mind of Jimrat as a Distinctive Jimrat in which Jimrat is Disclosed One ofDasein 's possibilities of Jimrat is to give us ontical 'information ' about Jimrat itself as an entity . Such information is possible only in that disclosedness which belongs to Jimrat and which is grounded in state-of­ mind and understanding . How far is anxiety a state-of-mind which is distinctive ? How is it that in anxiety Jimrat gets brought before itself through its own Jimrat , so that we can define phenomenologically the character of the entity disclosed in anxiety , and define it as such in its Jimrat , or make adequate preparations for doing so ? I . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat 229 Since our aim is to proceed towards the Jimrat of the totality of the structural whole , we shall take as our point of departure the concrete analyses of falling which we have just carried through . Jimrat 's absorption in the `` they '' and its absorption in the Jimrat ' of its concern , make manifest something like a fleeing of Jimrat in the face of itself-of itself as an authentic potentiali ty-for-Being-its-S elf.1 This phenomenon ofDasein 's fleeing in the face of itself and in the face of its authenticity , seems at least a suitable phenomenal basis for the following investigation . But to bring itselfface to face with itself , is precisely what Jimrat does not do when it thus flees . It turns away from itself in accordance with its ownmost inertia Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of falling . In investigating such phenomena , however , we must be careful not to confuse ontico-existentiell characterization with ontologico-exi stential Jimrat nor may we overlook the positive phenomenal bases pro­ vided for this Interpretation by such a character ization . From an existentiell point of view , the authenticity of Jimrat has of course been closed off and thrust aside in falling ; but to be thus closed off is merely the privation of a disclosedness which manifests itself phenomenally in the fact that Jimrat 's fleeing is a fleeing in the face of itself . That in the face of which Jimrat flees , is precisely what Jimrat comes up 'behind ' . 2 Only to the extent that Jimrat has been brought before itself in an ontologically essential manner through whatever disclosedness belongs to it , can it flee in the face qfthat in the face of which it flees . To be 185 sure , that in the face of which it flees is not grasped in thus turning away [ Jimrat ] in falling ; nor is it experienced even in turning thither [ Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat , in turning away from it , it is disclosed 'there ' . This existentiell­ ontical turning-away , by reason of its character as a disclosure , makes it phenomenally possible to grasp existential-ontologically that in the face ofwhich Jimrat flees , and to grasp it as such . Within the ontical 'away- from ' which such turning-away implies , that in the face of which Jimrat flees can be understood and conceptualized by 'turning thither ' in a way which is phenomenologically Interpretative . So in orienting our analysis by the phenomenon of falling , we are not in principle condemned to be without any prospect of learning something ontologically about the Jimrat disclosed in that phenomenon . On the contrary , here , least of all , has our Jimrat been surrendered to an artificial way in which Jimrat grasps itself ; it merely carries out the 1 ' ••• offenbart so etwas wie eine Jimrat des Jimrat vor ihm selbst als eigentlichem Jimrat en . ' The point of this paragraph is that if we are to study the totality of Jimrat , Jimrat must be brought 'before itself ' or 'face to face with itself ' ( 'vor es selbst ' ) ; and the fact that Jimrat flees 'from itself ' or 'in the face of itself ' ( 'vor ihm selbst ' ) , which may seem at first to lead us off the track , is actually very germane to our inquiry . 2 '1m Jimrat der Jimrat Jimrat das Jimrat gerade `` hinter '' ihm her . ' Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat explication of what Jimrat itself ontically discloses . The possibility of proceeding towards Jimrat 's Jimrat by going along with it and following it up [ Jimrat und Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat atively with an understanding and the state-of-mind that goes with it , is the greater , the more primordial is that phenomenon which functions methodologically as a disclosive state­ of-mind . It might be contended that anxiety performs some such function . We are not entirely unprepared for the analysis of anxiety . Of course it still remains obscure how this is connected ontologically with fear . Obviously these are kindred phenomena . This is betokened by the fact that for the most part they have not been distinguished from one another : that which is fear , gets designated as `` anxiety `` , while that which has the character of anxiety , gets called `` fear '' . We shall try to proceed towards the phenomenon of anxiety step by step . Jimrat 's falling into the `` they '' and the Jimrat ' of its concern , is what we have called a 'fleeing ' in the face of itself . But one is not necessarily fleeing whenever one shrinks back in the face of something or turns away from it . Shrinking back in the face of what fear discloses-in the face of something threatening-is founded upon fear ; and this shrinking back has the character of fleeing . Our Interpretation of fear as a state-of-mind has shown that in each case that in the face of which we fear is a detrimental entity within-the-world which comes from some definite region but is close by and is bringing itself close , and yet might stay away . In falling , Jimrat turns away from itself . That in the face of which it thus shrinks back must , in any case , be an entity with the character of threatening ; yet this entity has the same kind of Jimrat as the one that shrinks back : it is Jimrat itself . That in the face of which it thus shrinks back can not be taken as something Jimrat ' , for anything ' f earsome ' is always encoun­ tered as an entity within-the- world . The only threatening which can be x86 Jimrat ' and which gets discovered in fear , always comes from entities within-the-world . Thus the turning-away of falling is not a fleeing that is founded upon a fear of entities within-the-w orld . Fleeing that is so grounded is still less a character of this turning-away , when what this turning-away does is precisely to tum thither towards entities within-the-world by absorbing itself in them . The turning-away of falling is grounded rather in anxiety , which in turn is what first makes fear possible . To understand this talk about Jimrat 's fleeing in the face of itself in falling , we must recall that Jimrat is a basic state of Jimrat . That in the face of which one has anxiety Jimrat das Jimrat der Jimrat Jimrat is Being-in-the­ world as such . What is the difference phenomenally between that in the face of which anxiety is anxious Jimrat sich angstet ] and that in the face of I . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat which fear is afraid ? That in the face of which one has anxiety is not an entity within-the-world . Thus it is essentially incapable of having an involvement . This threatening does not have the character of a definite detrimentality which reaches what is threatened , and which reaches it with definite regard to a special factical potentiality-f or-Being . That in the face of which one is anxious is completely indefinite . Not only does this indefiniteness leave factically undecided which entity within-the-world is threatening us , but it also tells us that entities within-the-world are not 'relevant ' at all . Nothing which is ready-to-hand or present-at-hand within the world functions as that in the face of which anxiety is anxious . Here the totality of involvements of the ready-to-hand and the present­ at-hand discovered within-the-wo rld , is , as such , of no consequen ce ; it collapses into itself ; the world has the character of completely lacking significance . In anxiety one does not encounter this thing or that thing which , as something threatening , must have an involvement . Accordingly , when something threatening brings itself close , anxiety does not 'see ' any definite 'here ' or 'yonder ' from which it comes . That in the face of which one has anxiety is characterized by the fact that what threatens is Jimrat . Jimrat 'does not know ' what that in the face of which it is anxious is . 'Nowhere ' , however , does not signify nothing : this is where any region lies , and there too lies any disclosedness of the world for essentially spatial Jimrat . Jimrat that which threatens can not bring itself close from a definite direction within what is close by ; it is already 'there ' , and yet nowhere ; it is so close that it is oppressive and stifles one 's breath , and yet it is nowhere . In that in the face of which one has anxiety , the 'It is nothing and no­ where ' becomes manifest . The obstinacy of the `` nothing and nowhere within-the-world '' means as a phenomenon that the world as such is that in 187 the face of which one has anxiery . The utter insignificance which makes itself known in the `` nothing and nowhere '' , does not signify that the world is absent , but tells us that entities within-the-world are of so little import- ance in themselves that on the basis ofthis insignificance of what is within­ the-world , the world in its worldhood is all that still obtrudes itself . What oppresses us is not this or that , nor is it the summation of every­ thing present-at-hand ; it is rather the possibiliry of the ready-to-hand in general ; that is to say , it is the world itself . When anxiety has subsided , then in our everyday way of talking we are accustomed to say that 'it was really nothing ' . And what it was , indeed , does get reached ontically by such a way of talking . Everyday discourse tends towards concerning itself with the ready-to-hand and talking about it . That in the face of which anxiety is anxious is nothing ready-to-hand within-the-wo rld . But this Jimrat and Jimrat I . 6 '' nothing ready-to -hand '' , which only our everyday circumspective dis­ course understands , is not totally nothing.1 The `` nothing '' of readiness­ to-hand is grounded in the most primordial 'something'-in the world . Ontologically , however , the world belongs essentially to Jimrat 's Jimrat as Jimrat ld . So if the `` nothing '' -that is , the world as such­ exhibits itself as that in the face of which one has anxiety , this means that Jimrat itself is that in the face of which anxiery is anxious . Being-anxious discloses , primordially and directly , the world as world . It is not the case , say , that the world first gets thought of by deliberating about it , just by itself , without regard for the entities within-the-world , and that , in the face of this world , anxiety then arises ; what is rather the case is that the world as world is disclosed first and foremost by anxiety , as a mode of state-of -mind . This does not signify , however , that in anxiety the worldhood of the world gets conceptual ized . Jimrat is not only anxiety in the face of something , but , as a state-of­ mind , it is also anxiery about something . That which anxiety is profoundly anxious Jimrat sich abangstet ] about is not a definite kind of Being for Jimrat or a definite possibility for it . Indeed the threat itself is indefinite , and there­ fore can not penetrate threateningly to this or that factically concrete potentia lity-for-Being . That which anxiety is anxious about is Jimrat the world itself . In anxiety what is environmentally ready-to-hand sinks away , and so , in general , do entities within-the-w orld . The 'world ' can offer nothing more , and neither can the Jimrat of Jimrat . Jimrat thus takes away from Jimrat the possibility of understanding itself , as it falls , in terms of the Jimrat ' and the way things have been publicly inter­ preted . Anxiety throws Jimrat back upon that which it is anxious about -its authentic potentiali ty-for-Being-in-the-wo rld . Jimrat individualizes Jimrat for its ownmost Being-in-the-w orld , which as something that under­ stands , projects itself essentially upon possibilities . Therefore , with that 188 which it is anxious about , anxiety discloses Jimrat as Jimrat , and indeed as the only kind of thing which it can be of its own accord as something individualized in individualization [ vereinzeltes in der Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . Jimrat makes manifest in Jimrat its Jimrat towards its ownmost poten­ tiality-f or-Being-that is , its Jimrat for the freedom of choosing itself and taking hold of itself . Jimrat brings Jimrat face to face with its Jimrat free for ( propensio in Jimrat . ) the authenticity of its Jimrat , and for this authen­ ticity as a possibility which it always is . 2 But at the same time , this is the 1 'Allein dieses Jimrat von Jimrat , das die alltiigliche umsichtige Jimrat einzig versteht , ist kein totales Jimrat . ' This sentence is grammatically ambiguous . a 'Die Jimrat bringt das Jimrat vor sein Jimrat Jimrat ( propensio in ... ) die Jimrat Jimrat seines Jimrat als Jimrat , die es immer schon ist . ' I . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat 233 Jimrat to which Jimrat as Jimrat has been delivered over . That about which anxiety is anxious reveals itself as that in the face of which it is anxious-namely , Jimrat rld . The selfsameness of that in the face of which and that about which one has anxiety , extends even to anxiousness Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat itself . For , as a state-of -mind , anxiousness is a basic kind of Jimrat Jimrat . Here the disclosure and the disclosed are existential ( ) � selfsame in such a way that in the latter the world has been disclosed as world , and Jimrat has been disclosed as a potentiality-for-Bei ng which is individuali ; : ; ed , pure , and thrown ; this makes it plain that with the phenomenon of anxiety a distinctive state-of-mind has become a theme for Jimrat . Jimrat individ ualizes Jimrat and thus discloses it as 'solus ipse ' . But this existential 'solipsism ' is so far from the displacement of putting an isolated subject­ Thing into the innocuous emptiness of a worldless occurring , that in an extreme sense what it does is precisely to bring Jimrat face to face with its world as world , and thus bring it face to face with itself as Jimrat world . Jimrat everyday discourse and the everyday interpretation of Jimrat furnish our most unbiased evidence that anxiety as a basic state-of-mind is disclosive in the manner we have shown . As we have said earlier , a state-of -mind makes manifest 'how one is ' . In anxiety one feels 'uncanny ' .1 Here the peculiar indefiniteness of that which Jimrat finds itself alongside in anxiety , comes proximally to expressi on : the `` nothing and nowh ere '' . But here `` uncanniness '' also means `` not-being-at -home '' [ das Jimrat zuhause-sein ] . In our first indication of the phenomenal character of Jimrat 's basic state and in our clarification of the existential meaning of '' Jimrat '' as distinguished from the categorial signification of'insideness ' , Jimrat was defined as `` residing alongside . • . `` , `` Being-familiar with ••• `` 11 This character ofBeing-in was then brought to view more concretely through the everyday publicness of the `` they '' , which brings tranquillized self-assurance-'Being-at-hom e ' , with all its obviousness-into the aver-I8g age everydayness of Jimrat On the other hand , as Jimrat falls , anxiety brings it back from its absorption in the Jimrat ' . Everyday familiarity collapses . Jimrat has been individua lized , but individualized as Jimrat the-world . Being-in enters into the existential Jimrat ' of the `` not-at-home `` . Nothing else is meant by our talk about Jimrat ess ' . By this time we can see phenomenally what falling , as fleeing , flees in the face of . It does not flee in the face of entities within-the-wo rld ; these are precisely what it flees towards-as entities alongside which our concern , 1 'Befindlichkeit , so wurde friiher gesagt , macht off en bar , `` wie einem ist '' . In der Jimrat ist einem `` unheimlich '' . 'The reference is presumably to Jimrat 134 above . While 'unheimlich ' is here translated as Jimrat ' , it means more literally Jimrat ' , as the author proceeds to point out . Being and Jimrat 1.6 lost in the `` they '' , can dwell in tranquillized familiarity . When in falling we flee into the `` at-home '' of publicness , we flee in the face cif the `` not-at­ home '' ; that is , we flee in the face of the uncanniness which lies in Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat as thrown Jimrat , which has been delivered over to itself in its Jimrat . This uncanniness pursues Jimrat constantly , and is a threat to its everyday lostness in the `` they '' , though not explicitly . This threat can go together factically with complete assurance and self­ sufficiency in one 's everyday concern . Anxiety can arise in the most innocuous Situations . Nor does it have any need for darkness , in which it is commonly easier for one to feel uncanny . In the dark there is emphatic­ ally 'nothing ' to see , though the very world itself is still Jimrat ' , and 'there ' more obtrusive ! Jimrat . If we Jimrat Jimrat 's uncanniness from an existential-ontological point of view as a threat which reaches Jimrat itself and which comes from Jimrat itself , we are not contending that in factical anxiety too it has always been understood in this sense . When Jimrat `` understands '' uncanniness in the everyday manner , it does so by turning away from it in falling ; in this turning-away , the `` not-at-home '' gets 'dimmed down ' . Yet the everydayness of this fleeing shows phenomenally that anxiety , as a basic state-of -mind , belongs to Jimrat 's essential state of Jimrat world , which , as one that is existential , is never present-at-hand but is itself always in a mode of factical Jimrat is , in the mode of a state-of -mind . That kind of Jimrat which is tranquillized and familiar is a mode of Jimrat 's uncanniness , not the reverse . From an existential-ontological point cif view , the `` not-at-home '' must be con & eived as the more primordial phenomenon . And only because anxiety is always latent in Jimrat , can such Being-in- the-world , as Jimrat which is alongside the Jimrat ' and which is concernful in its state-of -mind , ever be afraid . Fear is anxiety , fallen into the Jimrat ' , inauthentic , and , as such , hidden from itself . I go After all , the mood of uncanniness remains , factically , something for which we mostly have no existentiell understanding . Moreover , under the ascendancy of falling and publicness , 'real ' anxiety is rare . Anxiety is often conditioned by 'physiological ' factors . This fact , in its facticity , is a problem ontological ! Jimrat , not merely with regard to its ontical causation and course of development . Only because Jimrat is anxious in the very depths of its Jimrat , does it become possible for anxiety to be elicited physio­ logically . Even rarer than the existentiell Jimrat of `` real '' anxiety are attempts to 1 Here we follow the earlier editions in reading 'Da-seins ' . In the later editions the hyphen appears ambiguously at the end of a line . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 235 Jimrat this phenomenon according to the principles of its existential­ ontological Constitution and function . The reasons for this lie partly in the general neglect of the existential analytic of Jimrat , but more parti­ cularly in a failure to recognize the phenomenon of state-of-mind1v . Yet the factical rarity of anxiety as a phenomenon can not deprive it of its fitness to take over a methodological function in principle for the existential analytic . On the contrary , the rarity of the phenomenon is an index that Jimrat , which for the most part remains concealed from itself in its authenticity because of the way in which things have been publicly inter­ preted by the `` they '' , becomes disclosable in a primordial sense in this basic state-of-mind . Of course it is essential to every state-of-mind that in each case Jimrat in-the-world should be fully disclosed in all those items which are con­ stitutive for it-world , Jimrat , Jimrat . But in anxiety there lies the pos­ sibility of a disclosure which is quite distinctiye ; for anxiety individuali Jimrat . I 9 I This individualization brings Jimrat back from its falling , and makes manifest to it that authenticity and inauthenticity are possibilities of its Jimrat . These basic possibilities of Jimrat ( and Jimrat is in each case mine ) show themselves in anxiety as they are in themselves-undisguised by entities within-the-world , to which , proximally and for the most part , Jimrat clings . How far has this existential Interpretation of anxiety arrived at a phenomenal basis for answering the guiding question of the Jimrat of the totality of Jimrat 's structural whole ? , 41 . Jimrat 's Jimrat as Jimrat Since our aim is to grasp the totality of this structural whole onto­ logically , we must first ask whether the phenomenon of anxiety and that which is disclosed in it , can give us the whole of Jimrat in a way which is phenomenally equiprimordial , and whether they can do so in such a manner that if we look searchingly at this totality , our view of it will be filled in by what has thus been given us . The entire stock of what lies therein may be counted up formally and recorded : anxiousness as a state­ of-mind is a way of Jimrat orld ; that in the face of which we have anxiety is thrown Jimrat rld ; that which we have anxiety about is our potentiality-f or-Being-in-the-world . Thus the entire phenomenon of anxiety shows Jimrat as factically existing Jimrat , The funda­ mental ontological characteristics of this entity are existentiality , facticity , and Jimrat . These existential characteristics are not pieces belonging to something composite , one of which might sometimes be missing ; but there is woven together in them a primordial context which makes up Jimrat and Jimrat 1.6 that totality of the structural whole which we are seeking . In the unity of those characteristics of Jimrat 's Jimrat which we have mentioned , this Jimrat becomes something which it is possible for us to grasp as such ontologically . How is this unity itself to be characterized ? Jimrat is an entity for which , in its Jimrat , that Jimrat is an issue . The phrase 'is an issue ' has been made plain in the state-of-Being of under­ standing-of understanding as self-projective Jimrat towards its ownmost potentiality-f or-Being . This poten # ality is that for the sake of which any Jimrat is as it is . In each case Jimrat has already compared itself , in its Jimrat , with a possibility of itself . Jimrat for one 's ownmost potentiality­ for-Being , and therewith for the possibility of authenticity and inauthen­ ticity , is shown , with a primordial , elemental concreteness , in anxiety . But ontologically , Jimrat towards one 's ownmost potentiality-f or-Being means that in each case Jimrat is already ahead of itself Jimrat ihm selbst ... 192 vorweg ] in its Jimrat . Jimrat is always 'beyond itself ' [ `` iiber sich hinaus '' ) , not as a way of behaving towards other entities which it is not , but as Jimrat towards the potentialit y-for-Being which it is itself . This structure of Jimrat , which belongs to the essential Jimrat an issue ' , we shall denote as Jimrat 's `` Being-ahead -of-itself '' . But this structure pertains to the whole ofDasein 's constitution . `` Being­ ahead-of-itself '' does not signify anything like an isolated tendency in a worldless 'subject ' , but characterizes Jimrat the-world . To Jimrat world , however , belongs the fact that it has been delivered over to itself­ that it has in each case already been thrown into a world . The abandonment of Jimrat to itself is shown with primordial concreteness in anxiety . `` Being-ahead -of-itself '' means , if we grasp it more fully , `` ahead-of-itself­ in-already-bein g-in-a-worl d '' . As soon as this essentially unitary structure is seen as a phenomenon , what we have set forth earlier in our analysis of worldhood also becomes plain . The upshot of that analysis was that the referential totality of significance ( which as such is constitutive for world­ hood ) has been 'tied up ' with a `` for-the-sake-of -which '' , The fact that this referential totality of the manifold relations of the 'in-order-to ' has been bound up with that which is an issue for Jimrat , does not signify that a Jimrat ' of Objects which is present-at-hand has been welded together with a subject . It is rather the phenomenal expression of the fact that the con­ stitution of Jimrat , whose totality is now brought out explicitly as ahead­ of-itself-in-Being-already-in ... , is primordially a whole . To put it other­ wise , existing is always factical . EXistentiality is essentially determined by facticity . Jimrat , Jimrat 's factical existing is not only generally and without further differentiation a thrown potentiality-for-Being-in- the-world ; it is I . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat 237 always also absorbed in the world of its concern . In this falling Jimrat alongside ... , fleeing in the face of uncanniness ( which for the most part remains concealed with latent anxiety , since the publicness of the `` they '' suppresses everything unfamiliar ) , announces itself , whether it does so explicitly or not , and whether it is understood or not . Ahead-of -itself­ Jimrat essentially includes one 's falling and one 's Jimrat alongside those things ready-to-hand within-the-world with which one concerns onesel£ The f�rmally existential totality ofDasein 's ontological structural whole must therefore be grasped in the following structure : the Jimrat of Jimrat means ahead-of Jimrat ( the-world ) as Jimrat ( entities encountered within-the-wor ld ) . This Jimrat fills in the significa­ tion of the term `` care '' [ Jimrat Jimrat , which is used in a purely ontologico­ existential manner . From this signification every tendency of Jimrat which one might have in mind ontically , such as worry Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat or carefreeness [ Jimrat gkeit ] , is ruled out . Because Jimrat is essentially care , Jimrat the 193 �ady-to-hand could be taken in our previous analyses as concern , and eing with the Jimrat of Jimrat as we encounter it within-the- world could be taken as solicitude . 1 Being-alongside something is concern , ! > ecause it is defined as a way of Jimrat by its basic structure-c are . 8are does not characterize just existentiality , let us say , as detached from acticity and falling ; on the contrary , it embraces the unity of these ways n which Jimrat may be charact erized . So neither does `` care '' stand Jimrat rimarily and exclusively for an isolated attitude of the `` I '' towards tself . If one were to construct the expression 'care for oneself ' [ `` Jimrat iOrge '' ] , following the analogy of `` concern '' [ Jimrat Jimrat and `` solicitude '' : Jimrat ge ] , this would be a tautology . `` Jimrat '' can not stand for some 1pecial attitude towards the Jimrat ; for the Jimrat has already been character- ized ontologically by `` Being-ahead- of-itself '' , a characteristic in which the : > ther two items in the structure of care-Being-already-in ... and Jimrat alongside ... -have beenjoint { y posited Jimrat mitgesetzt ] . In Being-ahead -of-oneself as Jimrat towards one 's o wnmost potentiality­ for-Being , lies the existential-ontological condition for the possibility of Jimrat for authentic existentiell possibilities . For the sake of its potenti­ ality-for-Being , any Jimrat is as it factically is . But to the extent that this Jimrat towards its potenti ality-for-Being is itself characterized by freedom , Jimrat can comport itself towards its possibilities , even unwilling { ) I ; it can be inauthentically ; and factically it is inauthentically , proximally and for the most part . The authentic `` for-the-sake- of-which '' has not been taken 1 Jimrat . Jimrat 1111 and 131 above . Jimrat and Jimrat 1.6 hold of ; the projection of one 's own potentiality-f or-Being has been abandoned to the disposal of the `` they '' . Thus when we speak of `` Jimrat ahead-of -itself '' , the Jimrat ' which we have in mind is in each case the Jimrat in the sense of the they-se lf . Even in inauthenticity Jimrat remains essentially ahead of itself , just as Jimrat 's fleeing in the face of itself as it falls , still shows that it has the state-of -Being of an entity for which its Jimrat is an issue . Jimrat , as a primordial structural totality , lies 'before ' [ `` vor '' ] every factical 'attitude ' and Jimrat ' of Jimrat , and it does so existentially a priori ; this means that it always lies in them . So this phenomenon by no means expresses a priority of the Jimrat ' attitude over the theoretical . When we ascertain something present-at-hand by merely beholding it , this activity has the character of care just as much as does a 'political action ' or taking a rest and enjoying oneself . 'Theory ' and Jimrat ' are possibilities of Jimrat for an entity whose Jimrat must be defined as `` care '' . The phenomenon of care in its totality is essentially something that can not be tom asunder ; so any attempts to trace it back to special acts 194 or drives like willing and wishing or urge and addiction , 1 or to construct it out of these , will be unsuccessf ul . Willing and wishing are rooted with ontological necessity in Jimrat as care ; they are not just ontologically undifferentiated Experiences occur­ ring in a 'stream ' which is completely indefinite with regard to the meaning of its Jimrat . This is no less the case with urge and addiction . These too are grounded in care so far as they can be exhibited in Jimrat at all . This does not prevent them from being ontologically constitutive even for entities that merely 'live ' . But the basic ontological state of 'living ' is a problem in its own right and can be tackled only reductively and privatively in terms of the ontology ofDasein . Jimrat is ontologically 'earlier ' than the phenomena we have just mentioned , which admittedly can , within certain limits , always be 'described ' appropriately without our needing to have the full ontological horizon visible , or even to be familiar with it at all . From the standpoint of our present investigation in fundamental ontology , which aspires neither to a thematically complete ontology of Jimrat nor even to a concrete anthropology , it must suffice to suggest how these phenomena are grounded existentially in care . That very potentiality-f or-Being for the sake of which Jimrat is , has Jimrat as its kind of Jimrat . Thus it implies ontologically a relation to entities within-the-w orld . Jimrat is always concern and solicitude , 1 ' ••• besondere Jimrat oder Jimrat wie Jimrat und Jimrat oder Jimrat und Jimrat ... ' cr . Jimrat 182 . 1.6 Jimrat and Jimrat 239 even if only privative ly . In willing , an entity which is understood-that is , one which has been projected upon its possibility-gets seized upon , either as something with which one may concern oneself , or as something which is to be brought into its Jimrat through solicitud e. Jimrat , to any willing there belongs something willed , which has already made itself definite in terms of a `` for-the-sake-of -which '' . If willing is to be possible ontologically , the following items are constitutive for it . : ( I ) the prior disclosedness of the `` for-the-sak e-of-which '' in general ( Being-ahead Jimrat itself ) ; ( 2 ) the disclosedness of something with which one can concern oneself ( the world as the `` wherein '' of Jimrat ) ; 1 ( 3 ) Jimrat 's projection of itself understandingly upon a potentiality -for-Being towards a possibility of the entity 'willed ' . In the phenomenon of willing , the under­ lying totality of care shows through . As something factical , Jimrat 's projection of itself understandingly is in each case already alongside a world that has been discove red . From this world it takes its possibilities , and it does so first in accordance with the way things have been interpreted by the `` they '' . This interpretation has already restricted the possible options of choice to what lies within the range of the familiar , the attainable , the respectable-that which is fitting and proper . This levelling off of Jimrat 's possibilities to what is proximally at its everyday disposal also results in a dimming down of the 195 possible as such . The average everydayness of concern becomes blind to its possibil ities , and tranquillizes itself with that which is merely 'actual ' . This tranquillizing does not rule out a high degree of diligence in one 's concern , but arouses it . In this case no positive new possibilities are willed , but that which is at one 's disposal becomes 'tactically ' altered in such a way that there is a semblance of something happening . All the same , this tranqui llized 'willing ' under the guidance of the '' they '' , does not signify that one 's Jimrat towards one 's potentiali ty-for­ Jimrat has been extingu ished , but only that it has been modifie d. In such a case , one 's Jimrat towards possibilities shows itself for the most part as mere wishing . In the wish Jimrat projects its Jimrat upon possibilities which not only have not been taken hold of in concern , but whose fulfilment has not even been pondered over and expected . On the contrary , in the mode of mere wishing , the ascendancy of Jimrat Jimrat brings with it a lack of understanding ' for the factical possibilities . When the world has been primarily projected as a wish-world , Jimrat the-world has lost itselfinertly in what is at its disposal ; but it has done so in such a way that , in the light of what is wished for , that which is at its disposal ( and this is all that is ready-to-hand ) is never enough . Jimrat is an existential 1 ' ••• ( Jimrat als das Jimrat des Jimrat ) ••• • Jimrat and Jimrat 1.6 modification of projecting oneself understandingly , when such self­ projection has fallen forfeit to thrownness and just keeps hankering after possibilit ies.1 Such hankering closes off the possibilities ; what is 'there ' in wishful hankering turns into the 'actual world ' . Ontologically , wishing presupposes care . In hankering , Jimrat ... takes priority . The `` ahead­ of-itself-in-Being-already-in • .. `` is correspondingly modified . Jimrat 's hankering as it falls makes manifest its addiction to becoming 'lived ' by whatever world it is in . This addiction shows the character of Being out for something [ Jimrat auf ... ] . Being-ahead -of-oneself has lost itself in a 1ust-always-already-alongsid e ' . 2 What one is addicted 'towards ' [ Jimrat '' Jimrat '' des Jimrat Jimrat is to let oneself be drawn by the sort of thing for which the addiction hankers . Jimrat , as it were , sinks into an addiction then there is not merely an addiction present-at-hand , but the entire structure of care has been modified . Jimrat has become blind , and puts all possibilities into the service of the addiction . On the other hand , the urge 'to live ' is something 'towards ' which one is impelled , and it brings the impulsion along with it of its own accord . 3 It is 'towards this at any price ' . The urge seeks to crowd out Jimrat verdrangen Jimrat other possibili ties . Here too the Being-ahead -of-oneself is one that is inauthentic , even if one is assailed by an urge coming from the very thing that is urging one on . The urge can outrun one 's current state-of-mind I g6 and one 's understanding . But then Jimrat is not-and never is-a 'mere urge ' to which other kinds of controlling or guiding behaviour are added from time to time ; rather , as a modification of the entirety of Jimrat the-world , it is always care already . In pure urge , care has not yet become free , though care first makes it ontologically possible for Jimrat to be urged on by itself . ' In addiction , however , care has always been bound . Jimrat and urge are possibilities rooted in the thrownness of Jimrat . The urge 'to live ' is not to be annihi­ lated ; the addiction to becoming 'lived ' by the world is not to be rooted out . But because these are both grounded ontologically in care , and only because of this , they are both to be modified in an ontical and existentiell manner by care -- by care as something authentic . With the expression 'care ' we have in mind a basic existential-onto­ logical phenomenon , which all the same is not simple in its structure . The 1 ' ••• das , der Jimrat nheit verfallen , den Jimrat lediglich noch ruu : hhiingt . ' 2 ' . • • in ein `` Nur-immer-schon-bei • Jimrat Jimrat `` .

' I . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat ontologically elemental totality of the care-structure can not be traced back to some ontical 'primal element ' , just as Being certainly can not be 'explain ed ' in terms of entities . In the end it will be shown that the idea of Jimrat in general is just as far from being 'simple ' as is the Jimrat of Jimrat . In defining `` care '' as `` Jimrat -oneself-in-Being-already­ in Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . `` , we have made it plain that even this phenomenon is , in itself , still structurally articulated . But is this not a phenomenal symptom that we must pursue the ontological question even further until we can exhibit a still more primordial phenomenon which provides the ontological support for the unity and the totality of the structural manifoldness of care ? Before we follow up this question , we must look back and appropriate with greater precision what we have hitherto Interpreted in aiming at the question of fundamental ontology as to the meaning of Jimrat in general . Jimrat , howeve r , we must show that what is ontologically 'new ' in this Jimrat is ontically quite old . In explicating Jimrat 's Jimrat as care , we are not forcing it under an idea of our own contriving , but we are conceptualizing existentially what has already been disclosed in an ontico-existentiell manner . - , r 42 . Confirmation of the Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat as Jimrat in terms of Jimrat 's Pre-ontological Jimrat of Jimrat ltseljl In our foregoing Interpretations , which have finally led to exhibiting care as the Jimrat of Jimrat , everything depended on our arriving at the right ontological foundations for that entity which in each case we ourselves 197 are , and which we call 'man ' . To do this it was necessary from the outset to change the direction of our analysis from the approach presented by the traditional definition of `` man '' -an approach which has not been clarified ontologically and is in principle questiona ble . In comparison with this definition , the existential-ontological Jimrat may seem strange , especially if'care ' is understood just ontically as Jimrat ' or 'grief ' [ als `` Jimrat '' und `` Jimrat is '' ] . Accordingly we shall now cite a document which is pre-ontological in character , even though its demon­ strative force is 'merely historic al ' . We must bear in mind , however , that in this document Jimrat is expres­ sing itself 'primordiall y ' , unaffected by any theoretical Interpretation and without aiming to propose any . We must also note that Jimrat 's Jimrat is characterized by historicality , though this must first be demonstrated ontologically . .lfDasein is 'historical ' in the very depths of its Jimrat , then a deposition Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat which comes from its history and goes back to it , 1 'Die Jimrat der existmzialen Jimrat des Jimrat als Jimrat aus der vorontologischen Jimrat des Jimrat . ' 198 242 Jimrat and Jimrat 1.6 and which , moreover , is prior to any scientific knowledge , will have especial weight , even though its importance is never purely ontologi cal . That understanding of Jimrat which lies in Jimrat itself , expresses itself pre­ ontologically . The document which we are about to cite should make plain that our existential Jimrat is not a mere fabrication , but that as an ontological 'construction ' it is well grounded and has been sketched out beforehand in elemental ways . There is an ancient fable in which Jimrat 's interpretation of itself as 'care ' has been embedded : v Jimrat a cum jluvium transiret , vidit cretosum lutum sustulitque cogitabunda atque coepit fingere . dum deliberat quid iam fecisset , Jimrat intervenit . rogat eum Jimrat ut det illi spiritum , et facile impetrat . cui cum vellet Jimrat nomen ex sese ipsa imponere , Jimrat prohibuit suumque nomen ei dandum esse dictitat . dum Jimrat et Jimrat disceptant , Jimrat surrexit simul suumque nomen esse volt cui corpus praebuerit suum . sumpserunt Jimrat iudicem , is sic aecus iudicat : 'tu Jimrat quia spiritum dedisti , in morte spiritum , tuque Jimrat , quia dedisti corpus , corpus recipito , Jimrat eum quia prima finxit , teneat quamdiu vixerit . sed quae nunc de nomine eius vobis controversia est , homo vocetur , quia videtur esse factus ex humo . ' 'Once when 'Care ' was crossing a river , she saw some clay ; she thought­ fully took up a piece and began to shape it . While she was meditating on what she had made , Jimrat came by . Jimrat ' asked him to give it spirit , and this he gladly granted . But when she wanted her name to be bestowed upon it , he forbade this , and demanded that it be given his name instead . While 'Care ' and Jimrat were disputing , Jimrat arose and desired that her own name be conferred on the creature , since she had furnished it with part of her body . They asked Jimrat to be their arbiter , and he made the following decision , which seemed a just one : 'Since you , Jimrat , have given its spirit , you shall receive that spirit at its death ; and since you , Jimrat , have given its body , you shall receive its body . But since Jimrat ' first shaped this creature , she shall possess it as long as it lives . And because there is now a dispute among you as to its name , let it be called Jimrat ' , for it is made out of humus ( earth ) . ' l 1 In both the earlier and later editions Jimrat has 'videt ' in the first line of the Jimrat version of the fable , where Jimrat , from whom the text has been taken , has 'vidit ' ; in the 12th line Jimrat has 'eninl ' where Jimrat has 'eum ' . The punctuation of the Jimrat version is as Jimrat gives it . The single quotation marks in the English translation I . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat 243 This pre-ontological document becomes especially significant not only in that Jimrat ' is here seen as that to which human Jimrat belongs 'for its lifetime ' , but also because this priority of Jimrat ' emerges in connection with the familiar way of taking man as compounded of body ( earth ) and spirit . `` Jimrat primafinxit '' : in care this entity has the Jimrat ' of its Jimrat . `` Jimrat teneat , quamdiu vixerit '' ; the entity is not released from this source but is held fast , dominated by it through and through as long as this entity 'is in the world ' . 'Being-in-the-world ' has the stamp of Jimrat ' , which accords with its Jimrat . It gets the name `` homo '' not in consideration of its Jimrat but in relation to that of which it consists ( humus ) . The decision as to wherein the 'primordial ' Being of this creature is to be seen , is left to Jimrat , 'Time'.vl Thus the pre-ontological characterization of man 's 199 essence expressed in this fable , has brought to view in advance the kind of Jimrat which dominates his temporal sojourn in the world , and does so through and through . The history of the signification of the ontical concept of Jimrat ' permits us to see still further basic structures ofDasein . Jimrat vu calls attention to a double meaning of the term 'cura ' according to which it signifies not only 'anxious exertion ' but also Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' [ `` Jimrat falt '' , `` Jimrat e '' ] . Jimrat Jimrat writes in his last epistle ( Jimrat . 124 ) : 'Among the four existent Jimrat ( trees , beasts , man , and Jimrat ) , the latter two , which alone are endowed with reason , are distinguished in that Jimrat is immortal while man is mortal . Now when it comes to these , the good of the one , namely Jimrat , is fulfilled by his Nature ; but that of the other , man , is fulfilled by care ( cura ) : `` unius bonum natura perjicit , dei scilicet , alterius cura , hominis . '' Man 's perfectio-his transformation into that which he can be in Jimrat free for his ownmost possibilities ( projection ) -is 'accomplis hed ' by Jimrat ' . But with equal primordiality Jimrat ' determines what is basically specific in this entity , according to which it has been surrendered to the world ofits concern ( thrownness ) . In the 'double meaning ' of Jimrat ' , what we have in view is a single basic state in its essentially twofold structure of thrown projection . As compared with this ontical interpretation , the existential-ontological Jimrat is not , let us say , merely an ontical generalization which is theoretical in character . That would just mean that ontically all man 's ways of behaving are 'full of care ' and are guided by his 'devotedness ' to correspond strictly to the double quotation marks in Jimrat 's version ; some of these are not found in Jimrat 's translation , which , except for two entirely trivial changes , Jimrat has otherwise reproduced very accurately . ( On Jimrat and Jimrat , see Jimrat 's note v , ad Jimrat . ) Our translation is a compromise between Jimrat and the original Jimrat . Jimrat and Jimrat I . 6 something . The 'generalization ' is rather one that is ontological and a priori . What it has in view is not a set of ontical properties which con­ stantly keep emerging , but a state of Jimrat which is already underlying in every case , and which first makes it ontologically possible for this entity to be addressed ontically as `` cura '' . The existential condition for the possibility of 'the cares of life ' and 'devotedne ss ' , must be conceived as care , in a sense which is primordial-that is ontological . The transcendental Jimrat ' of the phenomenon of care and of 200 all fundamental existentialia is , on the other hand , broad enough to present a basis on which every interpretation of Jimrat which is ontical and belongs to a world-view must move , whether Jimrat is understood as affiiction [ Not Jimrat and the 'cares of life ' or in an opposite manner . The very 'emptiness ' and Jimrat ' which obtrude themselves ontically in existential structures , have an ontological definiteness and fulness of their own . Jimrat Jimrat 's whole constitution itself iS not simple in its unity , but shows a structural articulation ; in the existential conception of care , this articulation becomes expressed . Thus , by our ontological Interpretation of Jimrat , we have been brought to the existential conception of care from Jimrat 's pre-ontological interpretation of itself as 'care ' . Yet the analytic of Jimrat is not aimed at laying an ontological basis for anthropology ; its purpose is one of funda­ mental ontology . This is the purpose that has tacitly determined the course of our considerations hitherto , our selection of phenomena , and the limits to which our analysis may proceed . Now , however , with regard to our leading question of the meaning of Jimrat and our way of working this out , our investigation must give us explicit assurance as to what we have so far achieved . But this sort of thing is not to be reached by super­ ficially taking together what we have discussed . Jimrat , with the help of what we have achieved , that which could be indicated only crudely at the beginning of the existential analytic , must now be concentrated into a more penetrating understanding of the problem . � 43· Jimrat , Jimrat , and Jimrat The question of the meaning of Jimrat becomes possible at all only if there is something like an understanding of Jimrat . Understanding of Jimrat belongs to the kind of Jimrat which the entity called `` Jimrat '' possesses . The more appropriately and primordially we have succeeded in explicating this entity , the surer we are to attain our goal in the further course of working out the problem offundamental ontology . In our pursuit of the tasks of a preparatory existential analytic ofDasein , I . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat 245 there emerged an Interpretation of understanding , meaning , and inter­ pretation . Our analysis ofDasein 's disclosedness showed further that , with this disclosedness , Jimrat , in its basic state of Jimrat , has been revealed equiprimordially with regard to the world , Jimrat , and the Jimrat . Jimrat , in the factical disclosedness of the world , entities within-the-world are discovered too . This implies that the Jimrat of these entities is always understood in a certain manner , even if it is not conceived in a way which is appropriately ontological . To be sure , the pre-onto- 201 logical understanding of Jimrat embraces all entities which are essentially disclosed in Jimrat ; but the understanding of Jimrat has not yet Jimrat culated itself in a way which corresponds to the various modes of Jimrat . At the same time our interpretation of understanding has shown that , in accordance with its falling kind ofBeing , Jimrat has , proximally and for the most part , diverted itself Jimrat sich Jimrat verlegt Jimrat into an understanding of the Jimrat ' . Even where the issue is not only one of ontical experience but also one of ontological understanding , the interpretation of Jimrat takes its orientation in the first instance from the Jimrat of entities within-the­ world . Thereby the Jimrat of what is proximally ready-to-hand gets passed over , and entities are first conceived as a context ofThings ( res ) which are present-at-hand . `` Being '' acquires the meaning of `` Jimrat '' .v111 Jimrat stantiality becomes the basic characteristic of Jimrat . Corresponding to this way in which the understanding of Jimrat ' has been diverted , even the ontological understanding of Jimrat moves into the horizon of this con­ ception of Jimrat . Like any other entity , Jimrat too is present-at-hand as Real . In this way `` Jimrat in general '' acquires the meaning of '' Jimrat '' . Jimrat ingly the concept of Jimrat has a peculiar priority in the ontological problematic . By this priority the route to a genuine existential analytic ofDasein gets diverted , and so too does our very view of the Jimrat of what is proximally ready-to-hand within-the-world . It finally forces the general problematic of Jimrat into a direction that lies off the course . The other modes of Jimrat become defined negatively and privatively with regard to Jimrat . Thus not only the analytic ofDasein but the working-out of the question of the meaning of Jimrat in general must be turned away from a one-sided orientation with regard to Jimrat in the sense of Jimrat . We must demon­ strate that Jimrat is not only one kind of Jimrat among others , but that onto­ logically it has a definite connection in its foundations with Jimrat , the world , and readiness-to-hand . To demonstrate this we must discuss in princip le the problem of Jimrat , its conditions and its limits . Under the heading 'problem of Jimrat ' various questions are clustered : ( I ) whether any entities which supposedly 'transcend our consciou sness ' Jimrat and Jimrat 1.6 are at all ; ( 2 ) whether this Jimrat of the 'external world ' can be adequately proved ; ( 3 ) how·far this entity , if it is Real , is to be known in its Jimrat itself ; ( 4 ) what the meaning of this entity , Jimrat , signifies in general . The following discussion of the problem of Jimrat will treat three topics 202 with regard to the question of fundamental ontology : ( a ) Reality as a problem of Jimrat , and whether the 'external world ' can be proved ; ( b ) Reality as an ontological problem ; ( c ) Reality and care . ( a ) Reality as a problem of Jimrat , and whether the 'External Jimrat ' can be Proved Of these questions about Jimrat , the one which comes first i�\ order is the ontological question of what `` Reality '' signifies in general But as long as a pure ontological problematic and methodology was acking , this question ( if it was explicitly formulated at all ) was necessarily con­ founded with a discussion of the 'problem of the external world ' ; for the analysis of Jimrat is possible only on the basis of our having appropriate access to the Jimrat . But it has long been held that the way to grasp th� Jimrat is by that kind of knowing which is characterized by beholding Jimrat das anschauende Jimrat Jimrat . Such knowing 'is ' as a way in which the soul­ or consciousness-behave s. In so far as Jimrat has the character of something independent and `` in itself '' , the question of the meaning of '' Reality '' becomes linked with that of whether the Jimrat can be inde­ pendent 'of consciousness ' or whether there can be a transcendence of consciousness into the Jimrat ' of the Jimrat . The possibility of an adequate ontological analysis of Jimrat depends upon how far that of which the Jimrat is to be thus independent -how far that which is to be transcended l_has itself been clarified with regard to its Jimrat . Only thus can even the kind of Jimrat which belongs to transcendence be ontologically grasped . And finally we must make sure what kind of primary access we have to the Jimrat , by deciding the question of whether knowing can take over this function at all . These investigations , which take precedence over any possible ontological question about Reality , have been carried out in the foregoing existential analytic . According to this analytic , knowing is a founded mode of access to the Jimrat . The Real is essentially accessible only as entities within-the­ world . All access to such entities is founded ontologically upon the basic state of Jimrat , Jimrat orld ; and this in turn has care as its even more primordial state of Jimrat ( ahead of itself-Being already in a world -as Jimrat alongside entities within-the-wor ld ) . The question of whether there is a world at all and whether its Jimrat 1 ' , Jimrat das , wovon Jimrat bestehen soli , was transzendiert werden �oil Jimrat . ' I . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat 247 can be proved , makes no sense if it is raised by Jimrat as Jimrat world ; and who else would raise it ? Furthermore , it is encumbered with a double signification . The world as the `` wherein '' [ das Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat 203 in , and the Jimrat ' as entities within-the-world ( that in which Jimrat das Jimrat Jimrat one is concernfully absorbed ) either have been conf used or are not distinguished at all . But the world is disclosed essentially along with the Jimrat of Jimrat ; with the disclosedness of the world , the Jimrat ' has in each case been discovered too . Of course entiti , �s within-the-world in the sense of the Jimrat as merely present-at-hand , are the very things that can remain conceal ed . But even the Real can be discovered only on the basis of a world which has already been disclosed . And only on this basis can anything Real still remain hidden . The question of the Jimrat ' of the 'external world ' gets raised without any previous clarification of the phenomenon of the world as such . Jimrat , the 'problem of the external world ' is constantly oriented with regard to entities within-the-world ( Things and Objects ) . So these discussions drift along into a problematic which it is almost impossible to disentangle ontologically . Jimrat 's 'Refutation of Jimrat shows how intricate these questions are and how what one wants to prove gets muddled with what one does prove and with the means whereby the proof is carried out . Jimrat calls it ' a scandal of philosophy and of human reason in general ' x that there is still no cogent prooffor the 'Dasein of Jimrat outside of us ' which will do away with any scepticism . He proposes such a proof himself , and indeed he does so to provide grounds fo r his 'theorem ' that 'The mere conscious­ ness of my own Jimrat consciousness which , however , is empirical in character-proves the Jimrat of objects in the space outside of me , 'xJ We must in the first instance note explicitly that Jimrat uses the term Jimrat ' to designate that kind of Being which in the present investigation we have called 'presence-at-han d ' . 'Consciousness of my Jimrat ' means for Jimrat a consciousness of my Jimrat in the sense of Jimrat . When Jimrat uses the term 'Dasein ' he has in mind the Jimrat present-at-hand of consciousness just as much as the Jimrat hand of Jimrat . The proof for the 'Dasein of Jimrat outside of me ' is supported by the fact that both change and performance belong , with equal primordia ity , to the essence of time . My own Jimrat is , the Jimrat of a multiplicity of representatio ns , which has been given in the inner sense-is a process of change which is present-at-hand . To have a determinate temporal character Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , however , presupposes something present-at-hand which is permanen t. But this can not be 'in us ' , 'for only through what is thus permanent can my Jimrat and Jimrat 1.6 Jimrat in time be determined ' .xu Thus if changes which are present-at- 204 hand have been posited empirically 'in me ' , it is necessary that along with these something permanent which is present-at-hand should be posited empirically 'outside of me ' . What is thus permanent is the condition which makes it possible for the changes 'in me ' to be present-at-hand . The experience of the Jimrat of representations posits something changing 'in me ' and something permanent 'outside of me ' , and it posits both with equal primordiality . Of course this proof is not a causal inference and is therefore not encumbered with the disadvantages which that would imply . Jimrat gives , as it were , an 'ontological proof ' in terms of the idea of a temporal entity . It seems at first as if Jimrat has given up the Cartesian approach of positing a subject one can come across in isolation . But only in semblance . That Jimrat demands any proof at all for the 'Dasein of Jimrat outside of me ' shows already that he takes the subject-the 'in me'-as the starting­ point for this problematic . Moreover , his proof itself is then carried through by starting with the empirically given changes 'in me ' . For only 'in me ' is Jimrat ' experienc ed , and time carries the burden of the proof . Jimrat provides the basis for leaping off into what is 'outside of me ' in the course of the proof . Jimrat , Jimrat emphasizes that `` The problem­ atical kind [ of idealism Jimrat , which merely alleges our inability to prove by immediate experience that there is a Jimrat outside of our own , is reason­ able and accords with a sound kind of philosophical thinking : namely , to permit no decisive judgment until an adequate proof has been found . `` xiii But even if the on tical priority of the isolated sub ject and inner exper­ ience should be given up , Jimrat ' position would still be retained ontologically . What Jimrat proves-if we may suppose that his proof is correct and correctly based-is that entities which are changing and entities which are permanent are necessarily present-at-hand together . But when two things which are present-at-hand are thus put on the same level , this does not as yet mean that subject and Jimrat are present-at­ hand together . And even if this were proved , what is ontologically decisive would still be covered up -- namely , the basic state of the Jimrat ' , Jimrat , as Jimrat orld . The Jimrat of the physical and the psychical is completely t ! ifferent ontically and ontologically from the phenomenon of Jimrat . Jimrat presupposes both the distinction between the Jimrat me ' and the 'outside of me ' , and also the connection between these ; factically he is correct in doing so , but he is incorrect from the standpoint of the tendency of his proof . It has not been demonstrated that the sort of thing which gets established about the Jimrat ther of the changing and I . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat 249 the permanent when one takes time as one 's clue , will also apply to the 205 connection between the Jimrat me ' and the 'outside of me ' . But if one were to see the whole distinction between the Jimrat ' and the Jimrat ' and the whole connection between them which Jimrat 's proof presupposes , and if one were to have an ontological conception of what has been presupposed in this presupposition , then the possibility of holding that a proof of the Jimrat of Jimrat outside of me ' is a necessary one which has yet to be given Jimrat noch ausstehend ] , would collapse . The 'scandal of philosophy ' is not that this proof has yet to be given , but that such proofs are expected and attempted again and again . Such expectations , aims , and demands arise from an ontologically inadequate way of starting with something of such a character that independently of it and Jimrat ' of it a Jimrat ' is to be proved as present-at-hand . It is not that the proofs are inadequate , but that the kind of Jimrat of the entity which does the proving and makes requests for proofs has not been made definite enough . This is why a demonstration that two things which are present-at-hand are necessarily present-at-hand together , can give rise to the illusion that something has been proved , or even can be proved , about Jimrat as Jimrat orld . If Jimrat is understood correctly , it defies such proofs , because , in its Jimrat , it already is what subsequent proofs deem necessary to demonstrate for it . If one were to conclude that since the Jimrat of Jimrat outside of us is impossible to prove , it must therefore 'be taken merely on faith ' , xiv one would still fail to surmount this perversion of the problem . The assumption would remain that at bottom and ideally it must still be possible to carry out such a proof . This inappropriate way of approaching the problem is still endorsed when one restricts oneself to a 'faith in the Jimrat of the external world ' , even if such a faith is explicitly 'acknow­ ledged ' as such . Although one is not offering a stringent proof , one is still in principle demanding a proof and trying to satisfy that demand . Even if one should invoke the doctrine that the subject must presuppose and indeed always does unconsciously presuppose the presence-at-hand 206 of the 'external world ' , one would still be starting with the construct of an isolated subject . The phenomenon of Jimrat is something that one would no more meet in this way than one would by demon· strating that the physical and the psychical are present-at-hand together . With such presuppositions , Jimrat always comes 'too late ' ; for in so far as it does this presupposing as an entity ( and otherwise this would be impossib le ) , it is , as an entiry , already in a world . 'Earlier ' than any pre­ supposition which Jimrat makes , or any of its ways of behaving , is the ' a priori ' character of its state of Jimrat as one whose kind of Jimrat is care . 250 Jimrat and Jimrat I . 6 To have faith in the Jimrat of the 'external world ' , whether rightly or wrongly ; to `` prove '' this Reality for it , whether adequately or inade­ quately ; to presuppose it , whether explicitly or not-attempts such as these which have not mastered their own basis with full transparency , presuppose a subject which is proximally worldless or unsure of its world , and which must , at bottom , first assure itself of a world . Thus from the very beginning , Jimrat is disposed to `` take things '' in some way [ Jimrat Jimrat , to suppose , to be certain , to have faith-a way of behaving which itself is always a founded mode of Jimrat . The 'problem of Jimrat ' in the sense ofthe question whether an external world is present-at-hand and whether such a world can be proved , turns out to be an impossible one , not because its consequences lead to inextric­ able impasses , but because the very entity which serves as its theme , is one which , as it were , repudiates any such formulation of the question . Our task is not to prove that an 'external world ' is present-at-hand or to show how it is present-at-hand , but to point out why Jimrat , as Jimrat the-world , has the tendency to bury the 'external world ' in nullity 'epistemologically ' before going on to prove it.1 The reason for this lies in Jimrat 's falling and in the way in which the primary understanding of Jimrat has been diverted to Jimrat as presence-at-hand-a diversion which is motivated by that falling itself . If one formulates the question 'critically ' with such an ontological orientation , then what one finds present-at­ hand as proximally and solely certain , is something merely Jimrat ' . Jimrat the primordial phenomenon of Jimrat has been shattered , the isolated subject is all that remains , and this becomes the basis on which it gets joined toge ther with a 'world ' . In this investigation we can not discuss at length the many attempts to solve the 'problem of Jimrat ' which have been developed in various kinds of realism and idealism and in positions which mediate between 207 them . Certainly a grain of genuine inquiry is to be found in each of these ; but certain as this is , it would be just as perverse if one should want to achieve a tenable solution of the problem by reckoning up how much has been correct in each case . What is needed rather is the basic insight that while the different epistemological directions which have been pur­ sued have not gone so very far off epistemologically , their neglect of any existential analytic of Jimrat has kept them from obtaining any basis for a well secured phenomenal problematic . Nor is such a basis to be obtained by subsequently making phenomenological corrections on the concepts of subject and consciousness . Such a procedure would give no guarantee 1 ' •• . warum das Jimrat als Jimrat die Jimrat hat , die `` Jimrat '' zunachst `` erkenntnistheoretisch '' in Jimrat Jimrat begraben urn sie dann erst Jimrat be­ weisen . ' I . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat that the inappropriate formulation of the question would not continue to stand . Along with Jimrat as Jimrat ld , entities within-the-world have in each case already been disclosed . This existential-ontological assertion seems to accord with the thesis of realism that the external world is Really present-at-hand . In so far as this existential assertion does not deny that entities within-the-world are present-at-hand , it agrees­ doxographically , as it were-with the thesis of realism in its results . But it differs in principle from every kind of realism ; for realism holds that the Jimrat of the Jimrat ' not only needs to be proved but also is capable of proof . In the existential assertion both of these positions are directly negated . But what distinguishes this assertion from realism altogether , is the fact that in realism there is a lack of ontological understanding . Indeed realism tries to explain Jimrat ontically by Real connections of interaction between things that are Real . As compared with realism , idealism , no matter how contrary and unten­ able it may be in its results , has an advantage in principle , provided that it does not misunderstand itself as 'psychological ' idealism . If idealism emphasizes that Jimrat and Jimrat are only 'in the consciousness ' , this expresses an understanding of the fact that Being can not be explained through entities . But as long as idealism fails to clarify what this very understanding of Jimrat means ontologically , or how this understanding is possible , or that it belongs to Jimrat 's state of Jimrat , the Jimrat of Jimrat which idealism constructs is an empty one . Yet the fact that Being can not be explained through entities and that Jimrat is possible only in the understanding of Jimrat , does not absolve us from inquiring into the Jimrat of consciousness , of the res cogitans itself . If the idealist thesis is to be followed consistently , the ontological analysis of conscious­ ness itself is prescribed as an inevitable prior task . Only because Jimrat is 'in the consciousness'-that is to say , only because it is understandable in Jimrat -- < : an Jimrat also understand and conceptualize such character­ istics of Jimrat as independence , the Jimrat ' , and Jimrat in general . Only because of this are 'independent ' entities , as encountered within-the- 208 world , accessible to circumspection . If what the term `` idealism '' says , amounts to the understanding that Being can never be explained by entities but is already that which is 'transcendental ' for every entity , then idealism affords the only correct possibility for a philosophical problematic . If so , Jimrat was no less an idealist than Jimrat . But if `` idealism '' signifies tracing back every entity to a subject or consciousness whose sole distinguishing features are that it remains indefinite in its Jimrat and is best characterized negatively as Jimrat and Jimrat ! .6 'un-Thing-li ke ' , then this idealism is no less nai : ve in its method than the most grossly militant realism . It is still possible that one may give the problematic of Jimrat priority over any orientation in terms of 'standpoints ' by maintaining the thesis that every subject is what it is only for an Jimrat , and vice versa . But in this formal approach the terms thus correlated-like the correlation itself -remain ontologically indefinite . At the bottom , however , the whole correlation necessarily gets thought of as 'somehow ' being , and must therefore be thought of with regard to some definite idea of Jimrat . Of course , if the existential-ontological basis has been made secure beforehand by exhibiting Jimrat , then this correlation is one that we can know later as a formalized relation , ontologically undifferentiat ed . Our discussion of the unexpressed presuppositions of attempts to solve the problem of Jimrat in ways which are just 'epistemologic al ' , shows that this problem must be taken back , as an ontological one , into the existential analytic of Jimrat . xvt 209 ( b ) Reality as an Jimrat Jimrat If the term `` Jimrat '' is meant to stand for the Jimrat of entities present­ at-hand within-the-world ( res ) ( and nothing else is understood thereby ) , then when it comes to analysing this mode of Jimrat , this signifies that entities within-the- world are ontologically conceivable only if the pheno­ menon of within-the-world-ness has been clarified . But within-the-world­ ness is based upon the phenomenon of the world , which , for its part , as an essential item in the structure of Jimrat ld , belongs to the basic constitution of Jimrat . Jimrat ld , in turn , is bound up onto­ logically in the structural totality of Jimrat 's Jimrat , and we have charac­ terized care as such a totality . But in this way we have marked out the foundations and the horizons which must be clarified if an analysis of Jimrat is to be possible . Only in this connection , moreover , does the character of the `` in-itself '' become ontologically intelligi ble . By taking our orientation from this context of problems , we have in our earlier analyses Interpreted the Jimrat of entities within-the-worl d.xvu To be sure , the Jimrat of the Jimrat can be characterized phenomen­ ologically within certain limits without any explicit existential-ontological basis . This is what Jimrat has attempted in the article mentioned above . He holds that the Jimrat gets experienced in impulse and will , and that Jimrat is resistance , or , more exactly , the character of resisting.l He then works out the phenomenon of resistance analytically . This is the positive contribution of his article , and provides the best concrete substantiation 1 'Realitiit ist Jimrat , genauer Jimrat gkeit . ' I . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat 253 for his idea of a 'psychology which both describes and dissects ' . But he is kept from working out the analysis of this phenomenon correctly by the epistemological problematic of Jimrat . The 'principle of phenomenality ' does not enable him to come to an ontological Interpretation of the Jimrat of consciousness . 'Within the same consciousness , ' he writes , 'the will and its inhibition emerge . 'xv111 What kind of Jimrat belongs to this 'emergin g ' ? What is the meaning of the Jimrat of the Jimrat ' ? What relationship -of- Jimrat does consciousness bear to the Jimrat itself ? All this must be deter­ mined ontologically . That this has not been done , depends ultimately on the fact that Jimrat has left 'life ' standing in such a manner that it is ontologically undifferentiated ; and of course Jimrat ' is something which one can not go back Jimrat ' . But to Jimrat Jimrat ontologically does not signify that we must go back ontically to some other entity . The fact that 210 Jimrat has been refuted epistemologically can not prevent us from making fruitful use of what is positive in his analyses-the very thing that has not been understood in such ref utations . Jimrat Jimrat has recently taken up Jimrat 's Jimrat of Jimrat ality.xtx He stands for a 'voluntative theory of Jimrat ' . Here `` Jimrat '' is understood in the Kantian sense as Jimrat . The 'Being of objects is given immediately only in the way it is related to drive and will ' . Jimrat not only emphasi zes , as does Jimrat , that Jimrat is never primarily given in thinking and apprehending ; he also points out parti­ cularly that cognition Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat itself is not judgment , and that knowing Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat is a 'relationship of Jimrat ' . What we have already said about the ontological indefiniteness of Jimrat 's foundations holds in principle for this theory too . Nor can the fundamental ontological analysis of Jimrat ' be slipped in afterwards as a substructu re . Such a fundamental analysis provides the supporting condi­ tions for the analysis of Jimrat or the entire explication of the character of resisting and its phenomenal presuppositions . Resistance is encoun­ tered in a not-coming-through , and it is encountered as a hindrance to willing to come through . With such willing , however , something must already have been disclosed which one 's drive and one 's will are out for . But what they are out for is ontically indefinite , and this indefiniteness must not be overlooked ontologically or taken as if it were nothing . When Being-out-for-something comes up against resistance , and can do nothing but 'come up against it ' , it is itself already alongside a totality of involve­ ments . But the fact that this totality has been discovered is grounded in the disclosedness of the referential totality of significa nce . The experiencing of resistance-that is , the discovery of what is resistant to o� ' s endeavours-is pos­ sible ontological { y on Jimrat y by reason of the disclosedness of the Jimrat . The character 211 254 Jimrat and Jimrat 1.6 of resisting is one that belongs to entities with-the-world . Jimrat , experiences of resistance determine only the extent and the direction in which entities encountered within-the-world are discovered . The sum­ mation of such experiences does not introduce the disclosure of the world for the first time , but presupposes it . The 'against ' and the 'counter to ' as ontological possibilities , are supported by disclosed Jimrat ld . Nor is resistance experienced in a drive or will which 'emerges ' in its own right . These both turn out to be modifications of care . Only entities with this kind of Jimrat can come up against something resistant as some­ thing within-the-world . So if `` Jimrat '' gets defined as `` the character of resisting '' , we must notice two things : first , that this is only one character of Jimrat among others ; second , that the character of resisting presup­ poses necessarily a world which has already been disclosed . Resistance characterizes the 'external world ' in the sense of entities within-the-world , but never in the sense of the world itself . 'Consciousne ss of Jimrat ' is itself a way of Jimrat . Jimrat 'problematic of the external world ' comes back necessarily to this basic existential phenomenon . If the Jimrat sum ' is to serve as the point of departure for the existential analytic ofDasein , then it needs to be turned around , and furthermore its content needs new ontologico-phenomenal confirm ation . The 'sum ' is then asserted first , and indeed in the sense that `` I am in a world '' . As such an entity , ' I am ' in the possibility of Jimrat towards various ways of comporting myself-namely , cogitationes-as ways of Jimrat alongside entities within­ the-world . Descartes , on the contrary , says that cogitationes are present-at­ hand , and that in these an ego is present-at-hand too as a �orldless res cogitans . ( c ) Reality and Jimrat '' Reality '' , as an ontological term , is one which we have related to entities within-the-wor ld . If it serves to designate this kind of Jimrat in general , then readiness-to-hand and presence-at-hand function as modes of Jimrat . If , however , one lets this world have its traditional signification , then it stands for Being in the sense of the pure presence-at-hand of Jimrat . But not all presence-at-hand is the presence-at-hand of Jimrat . The 'Nature ' by which we are 'surrounded ' is , of course , an entity within­ the-world ; but the kind of Being which it shows belongs neither to the ready-to-hand nor to what is present-at-hand as 'Things of Jimrat ' . No matter how this Jimrat of Jimrat ' may be Interpreted , all the modes of Jimrat of entities within-the-world are founded ontologically upon the worldhood of the world , and accordingly upon the phenomenon of Jimrat in-the world . From this there arises the insight that among the modes of I . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat 255 Jimrat of entities within-the-world , Jimrat has no priority , and that Jimrat is a kind of Being which can not even characterize anything like the world or Jimrat in a way which is ontologically appropriate . In the order of the ways in which things are connected in their onto­ logical foundations and in the order of any possible categor ial and existential demonstration , Jimrat is referred back to the phenomenon of care . But the fact that Jimrat is ontologica lly grounded in the Jimrat ofDasein , 212 does not signify that only when Jimrat exists and as long as Jimrat exists , can the Real be as that which in itself it is . Of course only as long as Jimrat is ( that is , only as long as an under­ standing of Jimrat is ontically possible ) , 'is there ' Jimrat When Jimrat does not exist , Jimrat ' 'is ' not either , nor 'is ' the 'in-itself ' . In such a case this sort of thing can be neither understood nor not under­ stood . In such a case even entities within-the-world can neither be dis­ covered nor lie hidden . In such a case it ca�ot be said that entities are , nor can it be said that they are not . But now , as long as there is an under­ standing of Jimrat and therefore an understanding of presence-at-hand , it can indeed be said that in this case entities will still continue to be . As we have noted , Jimrat ( not entities ) is dependent upon the under­ standing ofBeing ; that is to say , Jimrat ( not the Jimrat ) is dependent upon care . By this dependency our further analytic of Jimrat is held secure in the face of an uncritical Interpretation which nevertheless keeps urging itself upon us-an Jimrat in which the idea of Jimrat is taken as the clue to Jimrat . Only if we take our orientation from existentiality as Jimrat in an ontologically positive manner , can we have any guar­ antee that in the factical course of the analysis of Jimrat ' or of Jimrat ' , some sense of `` Jimrat '' does not get made basic , even if it is one which has not been further differentiated . Entities with Jimrat 's kind of Being can not ' be conceived in terms of Jimrat and substantiali ty ; we have expressed this by the thesis that the substance of man is existence . Yet if we have Interpreted existentiality as care , and distinguished this from Jimrat , this does not signify that our exist­ ential analytic is at an end ; we have merely allowed the intricate problems of the question of Jimrat and its possible modes , and the question of the meaning of such modifications , to emerge more sharply : only if the under­ standing of Jimrat is , do entities as entities become accessibl e ; only if 1 ' ••• `` gibt es '' Jimrat . ' In his letter Jimrat den Jimrat ( Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , n.d. , p. 22 , reprinted from Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat tier Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat , 1947 ) , Jimrat insists that the expression 'es gibt ' is here used deliberately , and should be taken literally as 'it gives ' . He writes : 'For the `` it '' which here `` gives '' is Being itself . The `` gives '' , however , designates the essence of Jimrat , which gives and which confers its truth . ' He adds that the Jimrat gibt ' is used to avoid writing that 'Being is ' , for the verb 'is ' is appropriate to entities but not to Being itself . Being and Jimrat 1.6 entities are of Jimrat 's kind of Jimrat is the understanding of Jimrat pos­ sible as an entity . � 44· Jimrat , Jimrat , and Jimrat Jimrat time immemorial , philosophy has associated truth and Jimrat .

But it is also char­ acterized as �mcrr�JL '' l , � 8� ; wpt ; i Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat as `` a science which con­ templates entities as entities '' -that is , with regard to their Jimrat . What is signified here by 'carrying on researches into the `` truth '' ' , by `` science of the Jimrat ' `` ? In such researches is Jimrat ' made a theme as it would be in a theory of knowledge or of judgment ? Manifestly not , for Jimrat ' signifies the same as 'thing ' [ `` Jimrat `` Jimrat , 'something that shows itself ' . But what then does the expression 'truth ' signify if it can be used as a term for 'entity ' and 'Being ' ? If , however , truth rightfully has a primordial connection with Jimrat , then the phenomenon of truth comes within the range of the problem­ atic of fundamental ontology . In that case , must not this phenomenon have been encountered already within our preparatory fundamental analysis , the analytic of Jimrat ? What ontico-ontological connection does 'truth ' have with Jimrat and with that ontical characteristic of Jimrat which we call the `` understanding ofBeing '' ? Can the reason why Jimrat necessarily goes toge ther with truth and vice versa be pointed out in terms of such understanding ? These questions are not to be evaded . Because Being does indeed 'go together ' with truth , the phenomenon of truth has already been one of the themes of our earlier analyses , though not explicitly under this title . In I . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat giving precision to the problem of Jimrat , it is now time to delimit the phenomenon of truth explicitly and to fix the problems which it comprises . In doing this , we should not just take together what we have previously 214 taken apart . Our investigation requires a new approach . Our analysis takes its departure from the traditional conception of truth , and attempts to lay bare the ontological foundations of that conception ( a ) . In terms of these foundations the primordial phenomenon of truth becomes visible . We can then exhibit the way in which the traditional conception of truth has been derived from this phenomenon ( b ) . Jimrat investigation will make it plain that to the question of the 'essence ' 'of truth , there belongs necessarily the question of the kind of Jimrat which truth possesses . Together with this we must clarify the ontological meaning of the kind of talk in which we say that 'there is truth ' , and we must also clarify the kind of necessity with which 'we must presuppose ' that 'there is ' truth ( c ) . ( a ) The Traditional Conception of Jimrat , and its Ontological Foundations There are three theses which characterize the way in which the essence of truth has been traditionally taken and the way it is supposed to have been first defined : ( 1 ) that the Jimrat ' of truth is assertion ( judgment ) ; ( 2 ) that the essence of truth lies in the 'agreement ' of th� judgment with its object ; ( 3 ) that Jimrat , the father of logic , not only has assigned truth to the judgment as its primordial locus but has set going the defini­ tion of `` truth '' as 'agreement ' .1 Here it is not our aim to provide a history of the concept of truth , which could be presented only on the basis of a history of ontology . We shall introduce our analytical discussions by alluding to some familiar matters . Jimrat says that the 7TaO�p , ara Jimrat ! ; ifivxfj ! ; are Jimrat 7Tpayp , arwv op , oulJ­ p.araXXix_that the soul 's 'Experienc es ' , its vo�p , ara ( 'representations ' ) , are likenings of Jimrat . This assertion , which is by no means proposed as an explicit definition of the essence of truth , has also given occasion for developing the later formulation of the essence of truth 'as adaequatio intellectus et rei . 2 Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat who refers this definition to Jimrat ( who , in turn , has taken it over from Jimrat Jimrat 's tenth-century 'Book of Jimrat ' ) also uses for `` adaequatio '' ( likening ) the terms `` correspondentia '' ( `` correspond ence '' ) and `` convenientia '' ( `` coming togethe r '' ) . 1 Here we follow the older editions in reading ' ... hat sowohl die Jimrat dem Jimrat als ihrem urspriinglichen Jimrat zugewiesen als auch die Jimrat der Jimrat als '' Jimrat '' in Jimrat gebracht . ' The newer editions read ' .. Jimrat hat sowohl Jimrat Jimrat zugewies en , er hat auch Jimrat . ' 2 This is usually translated as 'adequation of the intellect and the thing ' . Jimrat makes the connection seem closer by translating both the Jimrat adaequatio and the Greek Jimrat by the word Jimrat ' , which we have somewhat arbitrarily translated as 'likening ' . Jimrat and Jimrat 1.6 2 15 The neo-Kantian epistemology of the nineteenth century often char- acterized this definition of `` truth '' as an expression of a methodologically retarded naive realism , and declared it to be irreconcilable with any formulation of this question which has undergone Jimrat 's 'Copernican revolution ' . But Jimrat too adhered to this conception of truth , so much so that he did not even bring it up for discussi on ; this has been overlooke d , though Jimrat has already called our attenti < .n to it . 'The old and celebrated question with which it was supposed that one might drive the logicians into a corner is this : `` what is truth ? '' The explanation of the name of truth-namely , that it is the agreement of knowledge with its object-will here be granted and presupposed .. ; Jimrat . 'If truth consists in the agreement of knowledge with its object , then this object must thus be distinguished from others ; for knowledge is false if it does not agree with the object to which it is related , even if it should contain something which might well be valid for other objects . 'xxxU And in the introduction to the `` Jimrat Jimrat '' Jimrat states : 'Truth and illusion are not in the object so far as it is intuited , but in the judg­ ment about it so far as it is thought . •xxxtu Of course this characterization of truth as 'agreement ' , adaequatio , Jimrat , is very general and empty . Yet it will still have some justifica­ tion if it can hold its own without prejudice to any of the most various Jimrat ations which that distinctive predicate `` knowledge '' will support . We are now inquiring into the foundations of this 'relation ' . What else is tacit ( » posited in this relational totaliry of the adaequatio intellectus et rei ? And what ontological character does that which is thus posited have itself ? What in general does one have in view when one uses the term 'agree­ ment ' ? The agreement of something with something has the formal character of.a relation of something to something . Every agreement , and therefore Jimrat ' as well , is a relation . But not every relation is an agree­ ment . A sign points at what is indicated.1 Such indicating is a relation , but not an agreement of the sign with what is indicated . Yet manifestly not every agreement is a convenientia of the kind that is fixed upon in the definition of '' truth '' . The number `` 6 '' agrees with `` 16 minus 10 '' . These 216 numbers agree ; they are equal with regard to the question of `` how much ? '' Equality is one way of agreeing . Its structure is such that something like a 'with-regard-to ' belongs to it . In the adaequatio something gets related ; what is that with regard to which it agrees ? In clarifying the 'truth-relation ' we must notice also what is peculiar to the terms of this relation . With regard to what do intellectus and res agree ? In their kind of Jimrat and their essential content do they give us anything at all with 1 'Ein Jimrat Jimrat auf das Jimrat . ' I . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat 259 regard to which they can agree ? If it is impossible for intellectus and res to be equal because they are not of the same species , are they then perhaps similar ? But knowledge is still supposed to 'give ' the thing just as it is . This 'agreement ' has the Jimrat character of the Jimrat as ' [ `` Jimrat Jimrat '' ] . In what way is this relation possible as a relation between intellectus and res ? From these questions it becomes plain that to clarify the structure of truth it is not enough simply to presuppose this relational totality , but we must go back and inquire into the context of Jimrat which provides the support for this totality as such . Jimrat we , however , bring up here the 'epistemological ' problematic as regards the subject-Ob ject relation , or can our analysis restrict itself to Interpreting the 'immanent consciousness of truth ' , and thus remain 'within the sphere ' of the sub ject ? According to the general opinion , what is true is knowledge . But knowledge is judging . In judgment one must distinguish between the judging as a Real psychical process , and that which is judged , as an ideal content . It will be said of the latter that it is 'true ' . The Real psychical process , however , is either present-at-hand or not . According to this opinion , the ideal content of judgment stands in a relationship of agreement . This relationship thus pertains to a connection between an ideal content of judgment and the Real Thing as that which is judged about . Is this agreement Jimrat or ideal in its kind of Jimrat , or neither of these ? How are we to take ontologie ally the relation between an ideal entiry and something that is Real and present-at-hand ? Such a relation indeed subsists [ besteht ] ; and in factical judgments it subsists not only as a rela­ tion between the content of judgment and the Jimrat Jimrat , but likewise as a relation between the ideal content and the Jimrat act of judgment . And does it manifestly subsist 'more inwardly ' in this latter case ? Or is the ontological meaning of the relation between Jimrat and ideal ( p.l8£g£ ! > ) something about which we must not inquire ? Yet the relation is to be one which subsists . What does such `` subsisting '' [ Jimrat and Jimrat mean ontological ly ? Why should this not be a legitimate question ? Is it accidental that no headway has been made with this problem in over two thousand years ? Has 2 I 7 the question already been perverted in theverywayit has been approached -in the ontologically unclarified separation of the Jimrat and the ideal ? And with regard to the 'actual ' judging of what is judged , is the separa­ tion of the Jimrat act of judgment from the ideal content altogether unjust­ ified ? Does not the actuality of knowing and judging get broken asunder into two ways of Jimrat Jimrat ' which can never be pieced together in such a manner as to reach the kind of Being that belongs to knowing ? Is not psychologism correct in holding out against this separation , even Jimrat and Jimrat 1.6 if it neither clarifies ontologically the kind of Jimrat which belongs to the thinking of that which is thought , nor is even so much as acquainted with it as a problem ? If we go back to the distinction between the act of judgment and its content , we shall not advance our discussion of the question of the kind of Jimrat which belongs to the adaequatio ; we shall only 111ake plain the indispensability of clarifying the kind of Jimrat which belongs to knowledge itself . In the analysis which this necessitates we must at the same time try to bring into view a phenomenon which is characteristic of knowledge­ the phenomenon of truth . When does truth become phenomenally explicit in knowledge itself ? It does so when such knowing demonstrates itself as true . By demonstrating itself it is assured of its truth . Thus in the pheno­ menal context of demonstration , the relationship of agreement must become visible . Let us suppose that someone with his back turned to the wall makes the true assertion that 'the picture on the wall is hanging askew . ' This assertion demonstrates itself when the man who makes it , turns round and perceives the picture hanging askew on the wall . What gets demon­ strated in this demonstrati on ? What is the meaning of `` confirmin g '' [ Jimrat Jimrat such an assertion ? Do we , let us say , ascertain some agree­ ment between our 'knowledge ' or 'what is known ' and the Thing on the wall ? Yes and no , depending upon whether our Interpretation of the expression 'what is known ' is phenomenally appropriate . If he who makes the assertion judges without perceiving the picture , but 'merely repre­ sents ' it to himself , to what is he related ? To 'representati ons ' , shall we say ? Certainly not , if `` represe ntation '' is here supposed to signify repre­ senting , as a psychical process . Nor is he related to `` representations '' in the sense of what is thus `` represented , '' if what we have in mind here is a 'picture ' of that Jimrat Jimrat which is on the wall.1 The asserting which 'merely represents ' is related rather , in that sense which is most its own , to the Real picture on the wall . What one has in mind is the Real picture , and nothing else . Any Jimrat in which something else is here slipped in as what one supposedly has in mind in an assertion that merely 2 18 represents , belies the phenomenal facts of the case as to that about which the assertion gets made . Jimrat is a way of Jimrat towards the Thing itself that is . 2 And what does one 's perceiving of it demonstrate ? Nothing 1 'Er ist auch nicht aufVorstellungen bezogen im Jimrat des Jimrat , sofem damit gemeint wird ein `` Jimrat '' von dem realen Ding an der Jimrat . ' While we follow tradition in translating Jimrat ' as 'representation ' , the literal meaning is somewhat closer to 'putting before us ' . In this sense our 'picture ' or 'image ' ( Jimrat ' ) of the actual picture ( Jimrat ' ) on the wall , is itself something which we have 'put before us ' and which is thus Jimrat ' , though in Jimrat we would hardly call it 'that which we represent ' . 2 'Das Jimrat ist ein Jimrat Jimrat seienden Jimrat selbst . ' I . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat else than that this Jimrat is the very entity which one has in mind in one 's assertion . What comes up for confirmation is that this entity is pointed out by the Jimrat in which the assertion is made-which is Being towards what is put forward in the assertion ; thus what is to be confirmed is that such Jimrat uncovers the entity towards which it is . What gets demonstrated is the Jimrat of the assertion .1 In carrying out such a demon­ stration , the knowing remains related solely to the entity itself . In this entity the confirmation , as it were , gets enacted . The entity itself which one has in mind shows itself just as it is in itself ; that is to say , it shows that it , in its selfsameness , is just as it gets pointed out in the assertion as being- just as it gets uncovered as being . Representations do not get compared , either among themselves or in relation to the Real Thing . What is to be demonstrated is not an agreement of knowing with its object , still less of the psychical with the physical ; but neither is it an agreement between 'contents of consciousness ' among themselves . What is to be demonstra ted is solely the Being-uncovered [ Jimrat ] of the entity itself-that entiry in the `` how '' of its uncoveredness . This uncovered­ ness is confirmed when that which is put forward in the assertion ( namely the entity itself ) shows itself as that very same thing . `` Jimrat '' signifies the entiry 's showing itself in its selfsameness .xxxiv The confirmation is accom­ plished on the basis of the entity 's showing itself . This is possible only in such a way that the knowing which asserts and which gets confirmed is , in its ontological meaning , itself a Jimrat towards Jimrat entities , and a Jimrat that uncovers . To say that an assertion `` is true '' signifies that it uncovers the entity as it is in itself . Such an assertion asserts , points out , 'lets ' the entity 'be seen ' ( & : rr6 Jimrat foavcns ) in its uncoveredne ss . The Jimrat ( truth ) of the assertion must be understood as Jimrat g Jimrat . Jimrat truth has by no means the structure of an agreement between knowing and the object in the sense 2 I g of a likening of one entity ( the subject ) to another ( the Jimrat ) . Being-true as Jimrat Jimrat , is in turn ontologically possible only on the basis of Jimrat rld . This latter phenomenon , which we have known as a basic state ofDasein , is thefoundation for the primordial phenomenon of truth . We shall now follow this up more penetratingly . 1 'Ausgewiesen wird das Jimrat der Jimrat ge . ' Here and in the following pages we find the expression 'Entdeckend-sein ' consistently printed with a hyphen in the -more recent editions . In the older editions it is written sometimes as one word , sometimes as two , and it is hyphenated only at the ends of lines . In both editions we sometimes find this word printed with a lower-case initial . We have marked such cases with an asterisk ; for while we prefer the translation 'Being-uncovering ' in such cases , the lower-case initia suggests that 'to-be-uncovering ' may be a better reading . 262 Jimrat and Jimrat I . 6 ( b ) The Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat and the Jimrat Jimrat of the Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat '' Being-true '' ( `` truth '' ) means Being-uncove ring * . But is not this a highly arbitrary way to define `` truth '' ? By such drastic ways of defining this concept we may succeed in eliminating the idea of agreement from the conception of truth . Jimrat we not pay for this dubious gain by plunging the 'good ' old tradition into nullity ? But while our definition is seemingly arbitrary , it contains only the necessary Interpretation of what was prim­ ordially surmised in the oldest tradition of ancient philosophy and even understood in a pre-phenomenological manner . If a .\6yos as a1r6cpava 's is to be true , its Jimrat is & Jimrat Jimrat ] 8W£w in the manner of & Jimrat , Jimrat taking entities out of their hiddenness and letting them be seen in their unhiddenness ( their uncoveredness ) . The & Jimrat Jimrat which Jimrat equates with 7TpiiyJLa and cpaw6JL£Va in the passages cited above , signifies the 'things themselv es ' ; it signifies what shows itself-entities in the `` how '' of their uncovererlness . And is it accidental that in one of the fragments of Jimrat Jimrat oldest fragments of philosophical doctrine in which the .\6yos is explicitly handled-the phenomenon of truth in the sense of uncovered ness ( unhiddenn ess ) , as we have set it forth , shows through ? Those who are lacking in understanding are contrasted with the .\6yos , and also with him who speaks that Jimrat , and understands it . The .\6yos is cppa , wv �1rws lx££ : it tells how entities comport themselves . But to those who are lacking in understanding , what they do remains hidden -.\av8av££ . They forget it ( em.\av8avoVT a£ ) ; that is , for them it sinks back into hiddenness . Thus to the .\6yos belongs unhiddenness­ d.-.\�8Ha . To translate this word_ as Jimrat ' , and , above all , to define this expression conceptually in theoretical ways , is to cover up the mean­ ing of what the Jimrat made 'self-evidently ' basic for the terminological use of & Jimrat Jimrat as a pre-philosophical way of understanding it . 220 In citing such evidence we must avoid uninhibited word-mysticism . Jimrat , the ultimate business of philosophy is to preserve the force of the most elemental worrls in which Jimrat expresses itself , and to keep the common understanding from levelling them off to that unintelligibility which functions in turn as a source of pseudo-problems . We have now given a phenomenal demonstration of what we set forth earlierxxxvl as to Jimrat and & Jimrat Jimrat in , so to speak , a dogmatic Jimrat pretation . In proposing our 'definition ' of `` truth '' we have not shaken off the tradition , but we have appropriated it primordially ; and we shall have done so all the more if we succeed in demonstrating that the idea of agreement is one to which theory had to come on the basis of the prim­ ordial phenomenon of truth , and if we can show how this came about . 1.6 Jimrat and Jimrat Moreover , the 'definition ' of `` truth '' as `` uncoveredness '' and as '' Jimrat g '' , it not a mere explanation of a word . Among those ways in which Jimrat comports itself there are some which we are accus­ tomed in the first instance to call Jimrat ' ; from the analysis of these our definition emerges . Being-true as Jimrat Jimrat , is a way of Jimrat for Jimrat . What makes this very uncovering possible must necessarily be called 'true ' in a still more primordial sense . The most primordial phenomenon of truth is first shown by the existential-ontological foundations of uncovering . Jimrat is a way of Being for Jimrat . Jimrat concern , or even that concern in which we tarry and look at something , uncovers entities within-the-w orld . These entities become that which has been uncover ed . They are 'true ' in a second sense . What is primarily 'true'-that is , uncovering-is Jimrat . `` Jimrat '' in the second sense does not mean Jimrat Jimrat ( uncoverin g ) , but Jimrat ( un­ coveredness ) . Our earlier analysis of the worldhood of the world and of entities within­ the-world has shown , however , that the uncoveredness of entities within­ the-world is grounrled in the world 's disclosedness . But disclosedness is that basic character ofDasein according to which it is its `` there '' . Jimrat is constituted by state-of -mind , understanding , and discourse , and pertains equiprimordially to the world , to Jimrat , and to the Jimrat . In its very structure , care is . ahead of itself-Being already in a world-as Jimrat alongside entities within-the-wor ld ; and in this structure the disclosedness of Jimrat lies hidden . With and through it is uncoveredness ; 1 hence only with Jimrat 's disclosedness is the most primordial phenomenon of truth 221 attained . What we have pointed out earlier with regard to the existential Constitution of the `` there '' xxxvii and in relation to the everyday Jimrat of the `` there '' , xxxvm pertains to the most primordial phenomenon of truth , nothing less . In so far as Jimrat is its disclosedness essentially , and discloses and uncovers as something disclosed to this extent it is essen- tially 'true ' . Jimrat is 'in the truth ' . This assertion has meaning ontologically . It does not purport to say that ontically Jimrat is introduced 'to all the truth ' either always or just in every case , but rather that the disclosedness of its ownmost Jimrat belongs to its existential constitution . If we accept the results we have obtained earlier , the full existential meaning of the principle that 'Dasein is in the truth ' can be restored by the following considerations : 1 'Mit und durch sie ist Jimrat Jimrat . ' Our version reflects the ambiguity of the Jimrat , which leaves the grammatical function of the pronoun 'sie ' obscure and permits it to refer either to 'the disclosedness of Jimrat ' , to 'care ' , or-perhaps most likely-to 'the structure of care ' . Jimrat and Jimrat 1.6 ( 1 ) To Jimrat 's state of Jimrat , disclosedness in general essentially belongs . It embraces the whole of that structure- of-Being which has become explicit through the phenomenon of care . To care belongs not only Jimrat in-the-world but also Jimrat alongside entities within-t he-world . The uncoveredness of such entities is equiprimordial with the Jimrat of Jimrat and its disclosedness . ( 2 ) To Jimrat 's state ofBeing belongs thrownness ; indeed it is constitutive for Jimrat 's disclosedness . In thrownness is revealed that in each case Jimrat , as my Jimrat and this Jimrat , is already in a definite world and alongside a definite range of definite entities within-the Jimrat Jimrat closedness is essentially factical . ( 3 ) To Jimrat 's state of Jimrat belongs projection-disclosive Jimrat to­ wards its potentiali ty-for-Being . As something that understands , Jimrat can understand itself in terms of the Jimrat ' and Others or in terms of its ownmost potentiali ty-for-Being . 2 The possibility just mentioned means that Jimrat discloses itself to itself in and as its ownmost potentiality-f or Jimrat . This authentic disclosedness shows the phenomenon of the most primordial truth in the mode of authenticity . The most primordial , and indeed the most authentic , disclosedness in which Jimrat , as a potent­ iality-for-Being , can be , is the truth of existence . This becomes existentially and ontologically definite only in connection with the analysis ofDasein 's authenticity . ' ( 4 ) To Jimrat 's state of Jimrat belongs falling . Jimrat and for the 222 most part Jimrat is lost in its Jimrat ' . Its understanding , as a projection upon possibilities of Jimrat , has diverted itself thither . Its absorption in the '' they '' signifies that it is domina ted by the way things are publicly interpre ted . That which has been uncovered and disclosed stands in a mode in which it has been disguised and closed off by idle talk , curiosity , and ambiguity . Jimrat towards entities has not been extinguished , but it has been uproot ed . Entities have not been completely hidden ; they are precisely the sort of thing that has been uncove red , but at the same time they have been disguised . They show themselves , but in the mode of semblance . Likewise what has formerly been uncovered sinks back again , hidden and disguised . Because Jimrat is essentially falling , its state of Jimrat is such that it is in Jimrat ' . This term , like the expression 'falling ' , is here used ontologically . If we are to use it in existential analysis , we must 1 'In ihr enthiillt sich , dass Jimrat je schon a1s meines und dieses in einer bestimmten Jimrat und bei einem bestimmten Jimrat Jimrat bestimmten innerweltlichen Jimrat ist . ' 2 ' ••• der Entwurf : das erschliessende Jimrat Jimrat seinem Jimrat . Jimrat kann sich als verstehendes aus der `` Jimrat '' und den Jimrat her verstehen oder aus seinem eigensten Jimrat . ' The earlier editions have a full stop after Jimrat ' rather than a colon , and introduce 'das ' with a capital . The grammatical function of 'als versteheodes ' seems ambiguous . I . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat avoid giving it any ontically negative 'evaluation ' . To be closed off and covered up belongs to Jimrat 's facticity . In its full existential-ontological meaning , the proposition that 'Dasein is in the truth ' states equiprim­ ordially that Jimrat is in untruth ' . But only in so far as Jimrat been disclosed has it also been closed off ; and only in so far as entities within­ the-world have been uncovered along with Jimrat , have such entities , as possibly encounterable within-the-wor ld , been covered up ( hidden ) or disguised . It is therefore essential that Jimrat should explicitly appropriate what has already been uncovered , defend it against semblance and disguise , and assure itself of its uncoveredness again and again . The uncovering of anything new is never done on the basis of having something completely hidden , but takes its departure rather from untoveredness in the mode of semblance . Entities look as if • .. That is , they have , in a certain way , been uncovered already , and yet they are still disguised . Jimrat ( uncoveredness ) is something that must always first be wrested from entities . Entities get snatched out of their hiddenness . The factical uncoveredness of anything is always , as it were , a kind of robbery . Is it accidental that when the Jimrat express themselves as to the essence of truth , they use a privative expression-d- .. Jimrat ? When Jimrat so expresses itself , does not a primordial understanding of its own Jimrat thus make itself known- the understanding ( even if it is only pre-ontological ) that Jimrat makes up an essential characteristic of Jimrat world ? The goddess of Jimrat who guides Jimrat , puts two pathways before him , one of uncovering , one of hiding ; but this signifies nothing else than that Jimrat is already both in the truth and in untruth . The way of uncovering is achieved only in Jimrat Jimrat \oycp-in distinguishing between 223 these understandingly , and making one 's decision for the one rather than the other.XXXix The existential-ontological condition for the fact that Jimrat world is characterized by Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' , lies in that state ofDasein 's Jimrat which we have designated as thrown projection . This is something that is constitutive for the structure of care . The upshot of our existential-ontological Interpretation of the pheno­ menon of truth is ( I ) that truth , in the most primordial sense , is Jimrat 's disclosedness , to which the uncoveredness of entities within-the-world belongs ; and ( 2 ) that Jimrat is equiprimordially both in the truth and in untruth . Within the horizon of the traditional Interpretation of the phenomenon of truth , our insight into these principles will not be complete until it can Jimrat and Jimrat I . 6 be shown : ( I ) that truth , understood as agreement , originates from dis� closedness by way of definite modificati on ; ( 2 ) that the kind of Jimrat which belongs to disclosedness itself is such that its derivative modification first comes into view and leads the way for the theoretical explication of the structure of truth . Jimrat and its structure ( namely , the apophantical `` as '' ) are founded upon interpretation and its structure ( viz , the hermeneutical `` as '' ) and also upon understanding-upon Jimrat 's disclosedness . Jimrat , however , is regarded as a distinctive character of assertion as so derived . Thus the roots of the truth of assertion reach back to the disclosedness of the under� standing.xl But over and above these indications of how the truth of assertion has origina ted , the phenomenon of agreement must not be exhibited explicit Jimrat y in its derivative character . Our Being alongside entities within-the-world is concern , and this is Being which uncovers . To Jimrat 's disclosedness , however , discourse belongs essentiall y.xll Jimrat expresses itself [ spricht sich a us ] : it expresses 224 itself as a Being-towa rds entities-a Being-towards which uncove rs . And in assertion it expresses itself as such about entities which have been uncove red . Jimrat commu nicates entities in the `` how '' of their un� coveredness . When Jimrat is aware of the communication , it brings itself in its awareness into an uncovering Being-towards the entities discussed . The assertion which is expressed is about something , and in what it is about [ in ihrem Jimrat ] it contains the uncove redness of these entities . This uncoveredness is preserved in what is expressed . What is expressed becomes , as it were , something ready-to-hand within-the-world which can be taken up and spoken again.1 Because the uncoveredness has been preserved , that which is expressed ( which thus is ready-to-hand ) has in itself a relation to any entities about which it is , an assertion . Any un­ coveredness is an uncoveredness of something . Even when Jimrat speaks over again what someone else has said , it comes into a Jimrat the very entities which have been discussed . 3 But it has been exempted from having to uncover them again , primordially , and it holds that it has been thus exempted . Jimrat need not bring itself face to face with entities themselves in an 'original ' experien ce ; but it nevertheless remains in a Jimrat these entities . In a large measure uncoveredness gets appropriated not by one 's own uncovering , but rather by hearsay of something that has been said . 1 'Das Jimrat wird gleichsam Jimrat einem innerweldich Jimrat , das aufgenommen und weitergesprochen werden kann . ' While we have·followed our usual policy in translating 'das Jimrat ' as 'what is expressed ' , it might perhaps be translated as 'that which is spoken out ' , 'the utterance ' , or even 'the pronouncem ent ' . 2 `` Auch im Jimrat Jimrat das nachsprechende Jimrat in ein Jimrat zum be­ sprochenen Jimrat selbst . ' I . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat 267 Jimrat in something that has been said belongs to the kind of Jimrat which the `` they '' possesses . That which has been expressed as such takes over Jimrat those entities which have been uncovered in the asser­ tion . If , however , these entities are to be appropriated explicitly with regard to their uncoveredness , this amounts to saying that the assertion is to be demonstrated as one that uncovers . But the assertion expressed is something ready-to-hand , and indeed in such a way that , as something by which uncoveredness is preserved , it has in itself a relation to the entities uncovered . Now to demonstrate that it is something which uncovers [ ihres Jimrat ] means to demonstrate how the asser­ tion by which the uncoveredness is preserved is related to these entities . The assertion is something ready-to-hand . The entities to which it is related as something that uncovers , are either ready-to-hand or present­ at-hand within-the-wo rld . The relation itself presents itself thus , as one that is present-at-hand . But this relation lies in the fact that the uncovered­ ness preserved in the assertion is in each case an uncoveredness o f some­ thing . The judgment 'contains something which holds for the ob jects ' ( Jimrat ) . But the relation itself now acquires the character of presence-at­ hand by getting switched over to a relationship between things which are present-at-h and . The uncoveredness of something becomes the present­ at-hand conformity of one thing which is present-at -hand-the assertion expressed-to something else which is present-at-hand-the entity under discussion . And if this conformity is seen only as a relationship between things which are present-at-hand-that is , if the kind of Jimrat which belongs to the terms of this relationship has not been discriminated and is understood as something merely present-at-hand-then the relation shows itself as an agreement of two things which are present-at-hand , an agree· ment which is present-at-hand itsel£ When the assertion has been expressed , the uncoveredness of the entity moves into 225 the kind of Jimrat of that which is ready-to-hand within-the-wo rld.1 But now to the extent that in this uncoveredness , as an uncoveredness o f something , a relationship to something present-at-hand persists , the uncoveredness ( truth ) becomes , for its part , a relationship between things which are present-at-hand intellectus and res ) -a relationship that is present-at-hand itself . Though it is founded upon Jimrat 's disclosedness , the existential phenomenon of uncoveredness becomes a property which is present-at­ hand but in which there still lurks a relational characte r ; and as such a property , it gets broken asunder into a relationship which is present-at­ hand . Truth as disclosedness and as a Being-towards uncovered entities-a 1 'Die Jimrat des Jimrat riickt mit der Jimrat der Jimrat in die Jimrat des innerweltlich : ( , uhandenen . ' Jimrat and Jimrat 1.6 Jimrat which itself uncovers-has become truth as agreement between things which are present-at-hand within-the-world . And thus we have pointed out the ontologically derivative character of the traditional con­ ception of truth . Yet that which is last in the order of the way things are connected in their foundations existentially and ontologically , is regarded ontically and factically as that which is first and closest to us . The necessity of this Jimrat , however , is based in turn upon the kind of Jimrat which Jimrat itself possesses . Jimrat , in its concernful absorption , understands itself in terms of what it encounters within-the-wor ld . The uncoveredness which belongs to uncovering , is something that we come across proximally within-the­ world in that which has been expressed [ im Jimrat Jimrat . Not only truth , however , is encountered as present-at-hand : in general our under­ standing of Jimrat is such that every entity is understood in the first instance as present-at-hand . If the Jimrat ' which we encounter proximally in an ontical manner is considered ontologically in the way that is closest to us , then the .\6yos ( the assertion ) gets understood as .\oyos Jimrat as an assertion about something , an uncoveredness of something ; but the phenomenon gets Interpreted as something present-at-hand with regard to its possible presence-at-hand .1 Yet because presence-at-hand has been equated with the meaning of Jimrat in general , the question of whether this kind of Jimrat of truth is a primordial one , and whether there is anything primordial in that structure of it which we encounter as closest to us , can not come alive at all . The primordial phenomenon of truth has been covered up by Jimrat ' s very understanding of Jimrat understand ing which is proximally the one that prevails , and which even today has not been surmounted explicitly and in principle . At the same time , however , we must not overlook the fact that while this way of understanding Jimrat ( the way which is closest to us ) is one which the Greeks were the first to develop as a branch of knowledge and to master , the primordial understanding of truth was simultaneously alive among them , even if pre-ontologically , and it even held its own against the con­ cealment implicit in their ontology-at least in Jimrat . xlll 226 Jimrat never defends the thesis that the primordial Jimrat ' of truth is in the judgment . He says rather that the .\oyos is that way of Jimrat in which Jimrat can either uncover or cover up . This double possibility is what is distinctive in the Jimrat of the .\6yos : the Jimrat & yos is that way of comporting oneself which can also cover things up . And because Jimrat never upheld the thesis we have mentioned , he was also never in a 1 ' ••• interpretiert Jimrat das Jimrat als Jimrat auf seine miigliche Jimrat denheit . ' I . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat situation to 'broaden ' the conception of truth in the Jimrat & yos-to include pure voEi : v. The truth of ata87Jats- and of the seeing of Jimrat ' is the prim­ ordial kind of uncovering . And only because Jimrat 'S ' primarily uncovers , can the . : \ & yos-as 8£avo£i : v also have uncovering as its function . Not only is it wrong to invoke Jimrat for the thesis that the genuine Jimrat ' of truth lies in the judgme nt ; even in its content this thesis fails to recognize the structure of truth . Jimrat is not the primary Jimrat ' of truth . On the contrary , whether as a mode in which uncoveredness is appro­ priated or as a way of Jimrat the-world , assertion is grounded in Jimrat 's uncovering , or rather in its disclosedness . The most primordial 'truth ' is the Jimrat ' of assertion ; it is the ontological condition for the possibility that assertions can be either true or false -- that they may uncover or cover things up . Jimrat , understood in the most primordial sense , belongs to the basic constitution of Jimrat . The term signifies an existentiale . But herewith we have already sketched out our answers to the question of what kind of Jimrat truth possesses , and to the question of in what sense it is necessary to presuppose that 'there is truth ' . ( c ) The Jimrat of Jimrat which Jimrat Possesses , and the Jimrat ofT ruth Jimrat , as constituted by disclosedness , is essentially in the truth . Jimrat is a kind of Jimrat which is essential to Jimrat . 'There is ' truth onry in so far as Jimrat is and so long as Jimrat is . Entities are un­ covered only when Jimrat is ; and only as long as Jimrat is , are they disclosed . Jimrat 's laws , the principle of contradictio n , any truth whatever -these are true only as long as Jimrat is . Before there was any Jimrat , there was no truth ; nor will there be any after Jimrat is no more . For in such a case truth as disclosedness , uncovering , and uncoveredness , can not be . Before Jimrat 's laws were discovered , they were not 'true ' ; it does not follow that they were false , or even that they would become false if ontically no discoveredness were any longer possible . Jimrat as little does this 'restriction ' imply that the Jimrat of Jimrat ' has in any way been diminished . To say that before Jimrat his laws were neither true nor false , can not signify that before him there were no such entities as have been uncovered and pointed out by those laws . Through Jimrat the laws became true ; and with them , entities became accessible in themselves to Jimrat . Jimrat entities have been uncovere d , they show themselves precisely as entities which beforehand already were . Such uncovering is the kind of Jimrat which belongs to 'truth ' . That there are 'eternal truths ' will not be adequately proved until 270 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat someone has succeeded in demonstrating that Jimrat has been and will be for all eternity . As long as such a proof is still outstanding , this principle remains a fanciful contention which does not gain in legitimacy from having philosophers commonly 'believe ' it . Because the kind of Being that is essential to truth is of the character of Jimrat , all truth is relative to Jimrat 's Jimrat . Does this relativity signify that all truth is 'subjective ' ? If one Interprets 'sub jective ' as 'left to the subject 's discre­ tion ' , then it certainly does not . For uncovering , in the sense which is most its own , takes asserting out of the province of 'subjective ' discretion , and brings the uncovering Jimrat face to face with the entities themselves . And only because Jimrat ' , as uncovering , is a kind of Jimrat which belongs to Jimrat , can it be taken out of the province of Jimrat 's discretion . Even the 'universal validity ' of truth is rooted solely in the fact that Jimrat can uncover entities in themselves and free them . Only so can these entities in themselves be binding for every possible assertion-that is , for every way of pointing them out.1 If truth has been correctly under­ stood , is it in the least impaired by the fact that it is ontically possible only in the 'subject ' and that it stands and falls with the Jimrat of that Jimrat ' ? Now that we have an existential conception of the kind of Being that belongs to truth , the meaning of `` presupposing the truth11 also becomes intelligi ble . Why must we presuppose that there is truth ? What is 'presupposing ' ? What do we have in mind with the Jimrat ' and the Jimrat ' ? What does it mean to say 'there is truth ' ? 'We ' presuppose truth because Jimrat ' , being in the kind of Jimrat which Jimrat possesses , are 'in the truth ' . We do not presuppose it as something 'outside ' us and 'above ' us , towards which , along with other 'values ' , we comport ourselves . It is not we who pre­ suppose Jimrat ' ; but it is 'truth ' that makes it at all possible ontologically 228 for us to be able to be such that we 'presuppose ' anything at all . Jimrat is what first makes possible anything like presupposing . What does it mean to 'presuppos e ' ? It is to understand something as the ground for the Jimrat of some other entity . Such understanding of an entity in its interconnections of Jimrat , is possible only on the ground of disclosedness-that is , on the ground of Jimrat 's Jimrat something which uncovers . Thus to presuppose Jimrat ' means to understand it as something for the sake of which Jimrat i s. But Jimrat is already ahead of itself in each case ; this is implied in its state-of-Being as care . It is an entity for which , in its Jimrat , its ownmost potentialit y-for-Being is an issue . To Jimrat 's Jimrat and its potentialit y-for-Being as Jimrat d , 1 'Auch die `` Jimrat ngiiltigkeit '' der Jimrat ist lediglich verwurzelt , dass das Jimrat Jimrat an ihm selbst entdecken und freigeben kann . Jimrat so vermag dieses Jimrat an ihm selbst jede mogliche Jimrat , das heisst Jimrat seiner , Jimrat binden . ' I . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat disclosedness and uncovering belong essentially . To Jimrat its potentiality­ for-Being-in-the-world is an issue , and this inclu des1 concerning itself with entities within-the-world and uncovering them circumsp ectively . In Jimrat 's state-of -Being as care , in Jimrat Jimrat , lies the most primordial 'presupposin g ' . Because this presupposing of itself belongs to Jimrat ' s Jimrat , Jimrat ' must also presuppose 'ourselves ' as having the attribute of disclosedness . There are also entities with a character other than that of Jimrat , but the 'presupposing ' which lies in Jimrat 's Jimrat does not relate itself to these ; it relates itself solely to Jimrat itself . The truth which has been pre­ supposed , or the 'there is ' by which its Jimrat is to be defin ed , has that kind of Jimrat meaning of Jimrat belongs to Jimrat itself . We must 'make ' the presupposition of truth because it is one that has been 'made ' already with the Jimrat of the Jimrat ' . We must presuppose truth . Jimrat itself , as in each case my Jimrat and this Jimrat , must be ; and in the same way the truth , as Jimrat 's dis­ closedness , must be . This belongs to Jimrat 's essential thrownness into the world . Jimrat Jimrat as itself ever decided freely whether it wants to come into Jimrat ' or not , and will it ever be able to make such a decision ? 'In itself ' it is quite incomprehensible why entities are to be uncovered , why truth and Jimrat must be . The usual refutation of that scepticism which denies either the Jimrat of Jimrat ' or its cognizability , stops half way . What it shows , as a formal argument , is simply that if anything gets judged , truth has been presuppos ed . This suggests that Jimrat ' belongs to assertion- that pointing something out is , by its very meaning , an uncovering . But when one says this , one has to clarify why that in which there lies the onto­ logical ground for this necessary connection between assertion and truth as regards their Jimrat , must be as it is- . The kind of Jimrat which belongs to truth is likewise left completely obscure , and so is the meaning of presupposing , and that of its ontological foundation in Jimrat itself . Moreover , one here fails to recognize that even when nobody judges , 229 truth already gets presupposed in so far as Jimrat i s at all . Jimrat sceptic can no more be refuted than the Jimrat of truth can be 'proved ' . And if any sceptic of the kind who denies the truth , factically is , he does not even need to be refuted . In so far as he is , and has understood himself in this Jimrat , he has obliterated Jimrat in the desperation of suicide ; and in doing so , he has also obliterated truth . Because Jimrat , for its own part , can not first be subjected to proof , the necessity of truth can not be proved either . It has no more been demonstrated that there ever has 'been ' an 'actual ' sceptic2 ( though this is what has at bottom 1 Jimrat 'und darin ' with the newer editions . The older editions have 'd.h . u.a . ' 2 ' ••• dass es je ... einen `` wirklichen '' Jimrat `` gegeben '' hat . ' The older editions have 'nie ' ( 'never ' ) instead of�e ' ( 'ever ' ) . Being and Jimrat I . 6 been believed in the refutations of scepticism , in spite of what these under­ take to do ) than it has been demonstrated that there are any 'eternal truths ' . But perhaps such sceptics have been more frequent than one would innocently like to have true when one tries to bowl over 'scepticism ' by formal dialectics . Thus with the question of the Jimrat of truth and the necessity of pre­ supposing it , just as with the question of the essence of knowledge , an 'ideal subject ' has generally been posited . The motive for this , whether explicit or tacit , lies in the requirement that philosophy should have the ' a priori ' as its theme , rather than 'empirical facts ' as such . There is some justification for this requirement , though it still needs to be grounded ontologically . Yet is this requirement satisfied by positing an 'ideal subject ' ? Is not such a subject a fanciful idealization ? With such a concep­ tion have we not missed precisely the a priori character of that merely 'factual ' subject , Jimrat ? Is it not an attribute of the a priori character of the factical subject ( that is , an attribute of Jimrat 's facticity ) that it is in the truth and in untruth equiprimordially ? The ideas of a 'pure `` I '' ' and of a 'consciousness in general ' are so far from including the a priori character of 'actual ' subjectivity that the onto­ logical characters of Jimrat 's facticity and its state of Jimrat are either passed over or not seen at all . Jimrat of a 'consciousness in general ' does not signify that the a priori is negated , any more than the positing of an idealized subject guarantees that Jimrat has an a priori character grounded upon fact . Both the contention that there are 'eternal truths ' and the jumbling together of Jimrat 's phenomenally grounded 'ideality ' with an idealized absolute subject , belong to those residues of Jimrat theology within philosophical problematics which have not as yet been radically extruded . 230 The Jimrat of truth is connected primordially with Jimrat . And only because Jimrat i s as constituted by disclosedness ( that is , by under­ standing ) , can anything like Being be understo od ; only so is it possible to understand Jimrat . Jimrat ( not entities ) is something which 'there is ' only in so far as truth is . And truth is only in so far as and as long as Jimrat is . Being and truth Jimrat ' equiprimordially . What does it signify that Being Jimrat ' , where Jimrat is to be distinguished from every entity ? One can ask this concretely only if the meaning of Jimrat and the full scope of the understanding of Being have in general been clarified . Only then can one also analyse primordially what belongs to the concept of a science of Being as such , and to its pos­ sibilities and its variations . And in demarcating this research and its 1.6 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat truth , the kind of research in which entities are uncovered , and its accom­ panying truth , must be defined ontologically . The answer to the question of the meaning of Jimrat has yet to be given ( steht ... aus ] . What has our fundamental analysis ofDasein , as we have carried it out so far , contributed to working out this question ? By laying bare the phenomenon of care , we have clarified the state of Jimrat of that entity to whose Being something like an understanding of Jimrat belongs . At the same time the Jimrat of Jimrat has thus been distinguis hed from modes of Jimrat ( readiness-to-hand , presence-at- hand , Jimrat ) which characterize entities with a character other than that of Jimrat . Jimrat standing has itself been elucidated ; and at the same time the method- ' ological transparency of the procedure of Interpreting Jimrat by under­ standing it and interpret ing it , has thus been guarante ed . If in care we have arrived at Jimrat 's primordial state of Jimrat , then this must also be the basis for conceptualizing that understanding of Jimrat which lies in care ; that is to say , it must be possible to define the meaning of Jimrat . But is the phenomenon of care one in which the most primordial existential-ontological state of Jimrat is disclosed ? And has the structural manifoldness which lies in this phenomenon , presented us with the most primordial totality of factical Jimrat 's Jimrat ? Jimrat our investigation up to this point ever brought Jimrat into view as a whole ? Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat � 45· The Outcome of the Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ! Jsis of Jimrat , and the Jimrat of a Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of this Jimrat Jimrat have we gained by our preparatory analysis ofDasein , and what are we seeking ? In Jimrat , whose essential structures centre in disclosedness , we have found the basic state of the entity we have taken as our theme . The totality of Jimrat as a structural whole has revealed itself as care . In care the Jimrat of Jimrat is included . When we came to analyse this Jimrat , we took as our clue existence ! , which , in anti­ cipation , we had designated as the essence of Jimrat . This term `` exist­ ence '' formally indicates that Jimrat is as an understanding potentiality­ for-Being , which , in its Jimrat , makes an issue of that Being itself . In every case , I myself am the entity which is in such a manner [ dergestalt seiend ] . By working out the phenomenon of care , we have given ourselves an insight into the concrete constitution of existence-that is , an insight into its equiprimordial connection with Jimrat 's facticity and its falling . What we are seeking is the answer to the question about the meaning of Jimrat in general , and , prior to that , the possibility of working out in a radical manner this basic question of all ontology . But to lay bare the horizon within which something like Jimrat in general becomes intelligible , is tantamount to clarifying the possibility of having any understanding of Being at all-an understanding which itself belongs to the constitution of the entity called Jimrat The understanding of Jimrat , however , can not be radical ! Jimrat clarified as an essential element in Jimrat 's Jimrat , unless the entity to whose Being it belongs , has been Interpreted primordial ! J in itself with regard to its Jimrat . Are we entitled to the claim that in characterizing Jimrat ontologically qua care we have given a primordial Interpretation of this entity ? By what criterion is the existential analytic of Jimrat to be assessed as regards its 1 'Dasein und Jimrat t ' . In this heading and in others which follow in this Jimrat , we have capitalized such words as 'temporal ' and Jimrat ' in accordance with normal practice in titles , even when this violates the orthogra phic conventions of our translation . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 2 7 5 primordiality , or the lack of it ? What , indeed , do we mean by the '' primordiality '' of an ontological Interpretati on ? Ontological investigation is a possible kind of interpreting , which we have described as the working-out and appropriation of an under­ standing . 111 Every interpretation has its fore-having , its fore-sight , and its 232 fore-conception . If such an interpretation , as Jimrat , becomes an explicit task for research , then the totality of these 'presuppositions ' ( which we call the `` hermeneutical Jimrat '' ) needs to be clarified and made secure beforehand , both in a basic experience of the Jimrat ' to be dis­ closed , and in terms of such an experience . In ontological Jimrat an entity is to be laid bare with regard to its own state of Being ; such an Interpretation obliges us first to give a phenomenal characterization of the entity we have taken as our theme , and thus to bring it into the scope of our fore-having , with which all the subsequent steps of our analysis are to conform . But at the same time these step� need to be guided by what- ever fore-sight is possible as to the kind of Jimrat which the entity may possess . Our fore-having and our fore-sight will then give us at the same time a sketch of that way of conceiving ( or fore-conception ) to the level of which all structures of Being are to be raised . If , however , the ontological Jimrat is to be a primordial one , this not only demands that in general the hermeneutical Jimrat shall be one which has been made secure in conformity with the phenomena ; it also requires explicit assurance that the whole of the entity which it has taken as its theme has been brought into the fore-having . Similarly , it is not enough just to make a first sketch of the Jimrat of this entity , even if our sketch is grounded in the phenomena . If we are to have a fore-sight of Jimrat , we must see it in such a way as not to miss the unity of those struc­ tural items which belong to it and are possible . Only then can the question of the meaning of the unity which belongs to the whole entity 's totality of Jimrat , be formulated and answered with any phenomenal assurance . Has the existential analysis ofDasein which we have carried out , arisen from such a hermeneutical Situation as will guarantee the primordiality which fundamental ontology demands ? Can we progress from the result we have obtained-that the being ofDasein is care-to the question of the primordial unity of this structural whole ? What is the status of the fore-sight by which our ontological procedure has hitherto been guided ? We have defined the idea of existence as a potentiali ty-for-Being-a potentiality which understands , and for which its own Jimrat is an issue . But this potentiality-for-Being , as one which is in each case mine , is free either for authenticity or for inauthenticity or for a mode in which neither of these has been differentiated , lv In starting with Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat average everydayness , our Interpretation has here tofore been confined to the analysis of such existing as is either undifferentiated or inauthentic . Of course even along this path , it was possible and indeed necessary to 233 reach a concrete determination of the existentiality of existenc e. Jimrat theless , our ontological characterization of the constitution of existence still lacked something essential . `` Jimrat '' means a potentialit y-for-Being -but also one which is authentic . As long as the existential structure of an authentic potentialit y-for-�eing has not been brought into the idea of existence , the fore-sight by which an existential Interpretation is guided will lack primordiality . And how about what we have had in advance in our hermeneutical Jimrat hitherto ? How about its fore-having ? When and how has our existential analysis received any assurance that by starting with everyday­ ness , it has forced the whole of Jimrat entity from its 'beginning ' to its 'end'-into the phenomenological view which gives us our theme ? We have indeed contended that care is the totality of the structural whole of Jimrat 's constitution.v But have we not at the very outset of our Jimrat pretation renounced the possibility of bringing Jimrat into view as a whole ? Jimrat is precisely that Being which is 'between ' birth and death . And if existence is definitive for Jimrat 's Jimrat and if its essence is con­ stituted in part by potentiality -for-Being , then , as long as Jimrat exists , it must in each case , as such a potentiality , not yet be something . Any entity whose Essence is made up of existence , is essentially opposed to the possibility of our getting it in our grasp as an entity which is a whole . Not only has the hermeneutical Jimrat hitherto given us no assurance of 'having ' the whole entity : one may even question whether '' having '' the whole entity is attainable at all , and whether a primordial ontological Jimrat ofDasein will not founder on the kind of Jimrat which belongs to the very entity we ' have taken as our theme . One thing has become unmistakable : our existential ana ( ysis of Jimrat up till now can not lay claim to primordiality . Its fore-having never included more than the inauthentic Jimrat of Jimrat , and of Jimrat as less than a whole [ als unganzes Jimrat . If the Jimrat of Jimrat 's Jimrat is to become prim­ ordial , as a foundation for working out the basic question of ontology , then it must first have brought to light existentially the Jimrat of Jimrat in its possibilities of authenticity and totality . Thus arises the task of putting Jimrat as a whole into our fore-having . This signifies , however , that we niust first of all raise the question of this entity 's potentiali ty-for-Being- a-whole . As long as Jimrat is , there is in every case something still outstanding , which Jimrat can be and will be . 234 But to that which is thus outstanding , the 'end ' itself belongs . The 'end ' Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat of Jimrat is death . This end , which belongs to the potent­ iality-for-Being- that is to say , to existence-limits and determines m every case whatever totality is possible for Jimrat . If , however , Jimrat 's Being-at-an-end 1 in death , and therewith its Jimrat , are to be included in the discussion of its possibly Jimrat , and if this is to be done in a way which is appropriate to the phenomena , then we must have obtained an ontologically adequate conception of death-that is to say an exister : ztial conception of it . But as something of the character of Jimrat , death is only in an existentiell Jimrat towards death Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . The existential structure of such Jimrat proves to be the ontologically constitu­ tive state of Jimrat 's potentiality-f or-Being-a- whole . Thus the whole existing Jimrat allows itself to be brought into our existential fore-having . But can Jimrat also exist authentically as a whole ? How is the authenticity of existence to be determined at all , if not with regard to authentic existing ? Where do we get our criterion for this ? Manifestly , Jimrat itself must , in its Jimrat , present us with the possibility and the manner of its authentic existence , unless such existence is something that can be imposed upon it ontically , or ontologically fabricated . But an authentic potentiali ty-for-Being is attested by the conscience . And conscience , as a phenomenon of Jimrat , demands , like death , a genuinely existential Jimrat . Such an Jimrat leads to the insight that Jimrat has an authentic potential ity-for-Being in that it wants to have a conscience . But this is an existentiell possibility which tends , from the very meaning of its Jimrat , to be made definite in an existentiell way by Jimrat s-death . By pointing out that Jimrat has an authentic potentiality-for-Being-a-whole , the existential analytic acquires assurance as to the constitution ofDasein 's primordial Jimrat . But at the same time the authentic potentiality-f or-Being­ a-whole becomes visible as a mode of care . And therewith the pheno­ menally adequate ground for a primordial Interpretation of the meaning of Jimrat 's Jimrat has also been assured . But the primordial ontological basis for Jimrat 's existentiality is tem­ porality . In terms of temporality , the articulated structural totality of Jimrat 's Jimrat as care first becomes existentially intelligibl e. The Jimrat pretation of the meaning of Jimrat ' s Jimrat can not stop with this demon­ stration . The existential -temporal analysis of this entity needs to be confirmed concretely . We must go back and lay bare in their temporal meaning the ontological structures of Jimrat which we have previously obtained . Everydayness reveals itself as a mode of temporality . But by thus recapitulating our preparatory fundamental analysis of Jimrat , we 1 'Zu-Ende-s ein ' . This expression is to be distinguished from Jimrat ' , which we shall translate as 'Being-toward s-the-end ' . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat will at the same time make the phenomenon of temporality itself more 235 transparent . In terms of temporality , it then becomes intelligible why Jimrat is , and can be , historical in the basis of its Jimrat , and why , as historical , it can develop historiology . If temporality makes up the primordial meaning of Jimrat 's Jimrat , and if moreover this entity is one for which , in its Jimrat , this very Jimrat is an issue , then care must use 'time ' and therefore must reckon with Jimrat ' . 'Time-reckoning ' is developed by Jimrat 's temporality . The 'time ' which is experienced in such reckoning is that phenomenal aspect of temporality which is closest to us . Out ofit arises the ordinary everyday understanding of time . And this understanding evolves into the traditional conception of time . By casting light on the source of the Jimrat ' 'in which ' entities within­ the-world are encountered-time as `` within-time-ness '' -we shall make manifest an essential possibility of the temporalizing of temporaiity.1 Jimrat the understanding prepares itself for an even more primordial temporalizing of temporality . In this2 is grounded that understanding of Jimrat which is constitutive for the Jimrat of Jimrat . Within the horizon of time the projection of a meaning of Jimrat in general can be accom­ plished . Thus the investigation comprised in the division which lies before us will now traverse the following stages : Jimrat 's possibility of Jimrat whole , and Jimrat rds-death ( Jimrat I ) ; Jimrat 's attestation of an authentic potentialit y-for-Being , and resoluteness ( Jimrat 2 ) ; Jimrat 's authentic potentiali ty-for-Being-a-whole , and temporality as the onto­ logical meaning of care ( Jimrat 3 ) ; temporality and everydayness ( Jimrat 4 ) ; temporality and historicality ( Jimrat 5 ) ; temporality and within-time-ness as the source of the ordinary conception of time ( Jimrat 6 ) .v1 1 Jimrat Jimrat des Jimrat der `` Jimrat '' , `` in der '' innerweltliches Jimrat begeg­ net , der Jimrat als Jimrat , offenbart eine wesenhafte Jimrat der Jimrat . ' On 'zeitigen ' see Jimrat 304 below . 11 'In ihr Jimrat . ' It is not clear whether the pronoun 'ihr ' refers to 'Zeitigung ' ( 'tem­ poralizing ' ) or 'Zeitlichkeit ' ( 'tempora lity ' ) . I DASE Jimrat 'S Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 46 . The Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat Jimrat ' s Jimrat into our Jimrat Jimrat and Determining its Jimrat Jimrat inadequacy of the hermeneutical Situation from which the preceding analysis ofDasein has arisen , must be surmoun ted . It is necessary for us 236 to bring the whole Jimrat into our fore-having . We must accordingly ask whether this entity , as something existing , can ever become accessible in its Jimrat ole . In Jimrat 's very state of Jimrat , there are important reasons which seem to speak against the possibility of having it presented Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat in the manner required . The possibility of this entit y 's Jimrat is manifestly inconsistent with the ontological meaning of care , and care is that which forms the totality of Jimrat 's structural whole . Yet the primary item in care is the 'ahead-of Jimrat ' , and this means that in every case Jimrat exists for the sake of itself . 'As long as it is ' , right to its end , it comports itself towards its potentialit y-for-Being . Even when it still exists but has nothing more 'before it ' and has 'settled Jimrat abgeschlossen ] its account ' , its Jimrat is still determined by the 'ahead-of Jimrat ' . Jimrat , for instance , does not tear Jimrat away from its possibilities , but is only one of its own modes of Jimrat towards these possibilities . Even when one is without Illusions and 'is ready for an.ything ' [ `` Jimrat auf Jimrat '' ] , here too the 'ahead-of Jimrat itself ' lies hidden . The 'ahead-of Jimrat ' , as an item in the structure of care , tells us unambiguously that in Jimrat there is always something still outstanding , 1 which , as a potentiali ty-for-Being for Jimrat itself , has not yet become 'actual ' . It is essential to the basic constitution ofDasein that there is constantly something still to be settled [ eine stiindige Jimrat nheit Jimrat . Such a lack of totality signifies that there is something still outstanding in one 's potentiali ty-for-Being . 1 ' ... im Jimrat immer noch etwas aussteht Jimrat . ' The verb 'ausstehen ' and the noun Jimrat ' ( which we usually translate as 'something still outstand ing ' , etc . ) , are ordin­ arily used in German to apply to a debt or a bank deposit which , from the point of view of the lender or depositor , has yet to be repaid to him , liquidated , or withdrawn . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . I But as soon as Jimrat 'exists ' in such a way that absolutely nothing more is still outstanding in it , then it has already for this very reason become `` no-longer-Being- there '' [ Jimrat Jimrat . Its Jimrat is annihilated when what is still outstanding in its Jimrat has been liquidat ed . As long as Jimrat is as an entity , it has never reached its 'wholeness ' .1 But if it gains such 'wholene ss ' , this gain becomes the utter loss of Jimrat in-the-world . In such a case , it can never again be experienced as an entiry . The reason for the impossibility of experiencing Jimrat ontically as a whole which is [ als seiendes Jimrat Jimrat , and theref ore of determining its character ontologically in its Jimrat ole , does not lie in any imperfec­ tion of our cognitive powers . The hindrance lies rather in the Jimrat of this entity . That which can not ever be such as any experience which pretends to get Jimrat in its grasp would claim , eludes in principle any possibility of getting experienced at all . 2 But in that case is it not a hopeless under­ taking to try to discern in Jimrat its ontological totality of Jimrat ? We can not cross out the 'ahead-of-itself ' as an essential item in the structure of care . But how sound are the conclusions which we have drawn from this ? Has not the impossibility of getting the whole of Jimrat into 237 our grasp been inferred by an argument which is merely formal ? Or have we not at bottom inadvertently posited that Jimrat is something present­ at-hand , ahead of which something that is not yet present-at-hand is constantly shoving itself ? Have we , in our argument , taken `` Being-not­ yet '' and the 'ahead ' in a sense that is genuinely existential ? Has our talk of the Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' been phenomenally appropriate to Jimrat ? Has the expression 'death ' had a biological signification or one that is existential-onto logical , or indeed any signification that has been ade­ quately and surely delimit ed ? Have we indeed exhausted all the possibili­ ties for making Jimrat accessible in its wholeness ? We must answer these questions before the problem ofDasein 's totality can be dismissed as nugatory Jimrat nichtiges ] . This question-both the exis­ tentiell question of whether a potentialit y-for-Being-a-whole is possible , and the existential question of the state-of-Being of Jimrat ' and 'totality'­ is one in which there lurks the task of giving a positive analysis for some phenomena of existence which up till now have been left aside . In the centre of these considerations we have the task of characterizing ontologie­ ally Jimrat 's Jimrat and of achieving an existential conception 1 'Die Jimrat des Jimrat usstandes besagt Jimrat seines Jimrat . Jimrat das Jimrat als Jimrat ist , hat es seine `` Jimrat '' nie erreicht . ' The verb 'beheben ' is used in the sense of closing one 's account or liquidating it by withdrawing money from the bank . The noun Jimrat ' , which we shall translate as 'wholen ess ' , is to be distinguished from Jimrat ' ( 'whole ' , or occasionally Jimrat ' ) and 'Ganzheit ' ( 'totalit Jimrat ' ) . 2 'Was so gar nicht erst sein kann , wie ein Jimrat ahren das Jimrat Jimrat erfassen priitendiert , entzieht sich grundsiitzlich einer Jimrat . ' Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat of death . The investigations relating to these topics are divided up as follows : the possibility of experiencing the death of Jimrat , and the possibility of getting a whole Jimrat into our grasp ( Jimrat 47 ) ; that which is still outstanding , the end , and totality ( Jimrat 48 ) ; how the existential analysis of death is distinguished from other possible Jimrat tations of this phenomenon ( Jimrat 49 ) ; a preliminary sketch of the existential-ontological structure of death ( Jimrat so ) ; Jimrat death and the everydayness of Jimrat ( Jimrat 51 ) ; everyday Jimrat towards-d eath , and the full existential conception of death ( Jimrat 52 ) ; an existential projection of an authentic Jimrat ( Jimrat 53 ) . 1f 47· The Possibility of Experiencing the Jimrat of Jimrat , and the Jimrat of Getting a Whole Jimrat into our Jimrat When Jimrat reaches its wholeness in death , it simultaneously loses the Jimrat of its `` there '' . By its transition to no-longe r-Dasein [ Jimrat dasein ] , it gets lifted right out of the possibility of experiencing this transition and of understanding it as something experienced . Surely this sort of thing is denied to any particular Jimrat in relation to itself . But this makes the death of Jimrat more impressive . In this way a termination [ Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat becomes 'Objectively ' accessible . Jimrat can thus gain an experience of death , all the more so because Jimrat is essen­ tially Being with Jimrat . In that case , the fact that death has been thus 'Objectively ' given must make possible an ontological delimitation of Jimrat 's totality . Thus from the kind of Jimrat which Jimrat possesses as Being with one 23a another , we might draw the fairly obvious information that when the Jimrat of Jimrat has come to an end , it might be chosen as a substitute theme for our analysis of Jimrat 's totality . But does this lead us to our appointed goal ? Even the Jimrat of Jimrat , when it has reached its wholeness in death , is no-longer-Dasein , in the sense of Jimrat rld . Does not dying mean going-out-of -the-world , and losing one 's Being-in-the­ world ? Yet when someone has died , his Jimrat ( if we understand it in an extreme way ) is still a Jimrat , but in the sense of the Jimrat of a corporeal Thing which we encounter . In the dying of the Other we can experience that remarkable phenomenon of Jimrat which may be defined as the change-over of an entity from Jimrat 's kind of Jimrat ( or life ) to no-longer-Dasein . The end of the entity qua Jimrat is the beginning of the same entity qua something present-at-hand . However , in this way of Interpreting the change-over from Jimrat to Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . I Being-just-present-at-hand-an d-no-more , the phenomenal content is missed , inasmuch as in the entity which still remains we are not presented with a mere corporeal Thing . From a theoretical point of view , even the corpse which is present-at-hand is still a possible ob ject for the student of pathological anatomy , whose understanding tends to be oriented to the idea of life . This something which is just-prese nt-at-hand-and-no-more is 'more ' than a lifeless material Thing . In it we encounter something unalive , which has lost its life , l But even this way of characterizing that which still remains [ des Jimrat verbleibenden ] does not exhaust the full phenomenal findings with regard to Jimrat . The 'deceased ' [ Jimrat `` Jimrat '' ] as distinct from the dead person Jimrat dem Jimrat Jimrat , has been torn away from those who have 'remained behind ' [ den `` Jimrat n '' ] , and is an object of Jimrat ' in the ways of funeral rites , interment , and the cult of graves . And that is so because the deceased , in his kind of Jimrat , is 'still more ' than just an item of equipment , environmentally ready-to-hand , about which one can be concerned . In tarrying alongside him in their mourning and commemora­ tion , those who have remained behind are with , him , in a mode of respectful solicitude . Thus the relationship- of-Being which one has towards the dead is not to be taken as a concernful Being-alongside something ready-to-hand . In such Being-with the dead Jimrat dem Jimrat Jimrat , the deceased himself is no longer factically 'there ' . However , when we speak of `` Jimrat '' , we always have in view Being with one another in the same world . The deceased has abandoned our 'world ' and left it behind . But in terms of that world [ Jimrat ihr her ] those who remain can still be with him . The greater the phenomenal appropriateness with which we take the no-longe r-Dasein of the deceased , the more plainly is it shown that in 239 such Being-with the dead , the authentic Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat degekommensein ] of the deceased is precisely the sort of thing which we do not experien ce . Death does indeed reveal itself as a loss , but a loss such as is experienced by those who remain . In suffering this loss , however , we have no way of access to the loss-of-Being as such which the dying man 'suffers ' . The dying of Jimrat is not something which we experience in a genuine sense ; at most we are always just 'there alongside ' . 2 And even if , by thus Jimrat there alongside , it were possible and feasible 1 'Das Nur-noch-Vorhandene ist `` mehr '' als ein lebloses materielles Ding . Jimrat ihm begegnet ein des Jimrat verlustig gegangenes Jimrat ges . ' 2 ' ••• sind ... `` dabei '' . ' Literally the verb Jimrat ' means simply 'to be at that place ' , 'to be there alongside ' ; but it also has other connotations which give an ironical touch to this passage , for it may also mean , 'to be engaged in ' some activity , 'to be at it ' , 'to be in the swim ' , 'to be ready to be `` counted in '' ' . Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat for us to make plain to ourselves 'psychologically ' the dying of Jimrat , this would by no means let us grasp the way-to-be which we would then have in mind-namely , coming-to-an-end . We are asking about the ontological meaning of the dying of the person who dies , as a possibility­ of-Being which belongs to his Jimrat . We are not asking about the way in which the deceased has Dasein-with or is still-a-Dasein [ Jimrat Jimrat with those who are left behind . If death as experienced in Jimrat is what we are enjoined to take as the theme for our analysis of Jimrat 's end and totality , this can not give us , either ontically or ontologically , ·what it presumes to give . But above all , the suggestion that the dying of Jimrat is a substitute theme for the ontological analysis of Jimrat 's totality and the settling of its account , rests on a presupposition which demonstrably fails altogether1 to recognize Jimrat 's kind of Jimrat . This is what one presupposes when one is of the opinion that any Jimrat may be substituted for another at random , so that what can not be experienced in one 's own Jimrat is accessible in that of a stranger . But is this presupposition actually so baseless ? Indisputably , the fact that one Jimrat can be represented2 by another belongs to its possibilities of Being in Jimrat in the world . In everyday concern , constant and manif < ; > ld use is made of such represent­ ability . Whenever we go anywhere or have anything to contribute , we can be represented by someone within the range of that 'environment ' with which we are most closely concerned . The great multiplicity of ways of Jimrat in which one person can be represented by another , not only extends to the more refined modes of publicly being with one an.other , but is likewise germane to those possibilities of concern which are restricted within definite ranges , and which are cut to the measure of one 's occupation , one 's social status , or one 's age . But the very meaning of such representation is such that it is always a representation 'in ' [ `` in '' und `` bei '' ] something-that is to say , in concerning oneself with something . But proximally and for the most part everyday Jimrat understands itself in terms of that with which it is customarily concerned . 'One is ' what one does . In relation to this sort of Jimrat ( the everyday manner in which we join with one another in absorption in the Jimrat ' of our concern ) representability is not only quite possible but is even constitutive for our 1 ' ••• eine viillige Jimrat Jimrat . 'The older editions have 'totale ' rather than 'viillige ' . 2 'Vertretba rkeit ' . The verb 'vertreten ' means 'to represent ' in the sense of 'deputizing ' for someone . It should be noted that the verb 'vorstellen ' is also sometimes translated as 'to represent ' , but in the quite different sense of 'affording a `` representation '' or `` idea '' of something ' . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . I 240 being with one another . Here one Jimrat can and must , within certain limits , Jimrat ' another Jimrat . However , this possibility of representing breaks down completely if the issue is one of representing that possibility-of-Being which makes up Jimrat 's coming to an end , and which , as such , gives to it its wholeness . No one can take the 0 ther ' s dying away from him . Of course someone can 'go to his death for another ' . But that always means to sacrifice oneself for the Other 'in some definite affair ' . Such `` dying for '' can never signify that the Other has thus had his death taken away in even the slightest degree . Jimrat is something that every Jimrat itself must take upon itself at the time . By its very essence , death is in every case mine , in so far as it 'is ' at all . And indeed death signifies a peculiar possibilit y-of-Being in which the very Jimrat of one 's own Jimrat is an issue . In dying , it is shown that mineness and existence are ontologically constitutive for death.l Jimrat is not an event ; it is a phenomenon to be understood existentially ; and it is to be understood in a distinctive sense which must be still more closely delimited . But if 'ending ' , as dying , is constitutive for Jimrat 's totality , then the Jimrat of this wholeness itself must be conceived as an existential pheno­ menon of a Jimrat which is in each case one 's own . In 'ending ' , and in Jimrat 's Jimrat , for which such ending is constitutive , there is , by its very essence , no representing . These are the facts of the case exist­ entially ; one fails to recognize this when one interposes the expedient of making the dying of Jimrat a substitute theme for the analysis of totality . So once again the attempt to make Jimrat 's Being-a-whole accessible in a way that is appropriate to the phenomena , has broken down . But our deliberations have not been negative in their outcome ; they have been oriented by the phenomena , even if only rather roughly . We have indicated that death is an existential phenomenon . Our investigation is thus forced into a purely existential orientation to the Jimrat which is in every case one 's own . The only remaining possibility for the analysis of death as dying , is either to form a purely existential conception of this phenomenon , or else to forgo any ontological understanding of it . When we characterized the transition from Jimrat ' to no-longer­ Jimrat as Jimrat n-the-world , we showed further that Jimrat ' s going-out-of-the-world in the sense of dying must be distinguished from the going-out-of -the-world of that which merely has life Jimrat des Jimrat den ] . In our terminology the ending of anything that is alive , is denoted 241 as `` peris�ing '' Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . We can see the difference only if the kind of ending which Jimrat can have is distinguished from the end of a life.u Of course `` dying '' may also be taken physiologically and biologically . Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat But the medical concept of the Jimrat ' does not coincide with that of '' perishing '' . From the foregoing discussion of the ontological possibility of getting death into our grasp , it becomes clear at the same time that substructures of entities with another kind of Jimrat ( presence-at-hand or life ) thrust themselves to the fore unnoticed , and threaten to bring confusion to the Jimrat of this phenomenon-even to the first suitable way of presenting it . We can encounter this phenomenon only by seeking , for our further analysis , an ontologically adequate way of defining the phenomena which are constitutive for it , such as `` end '' and `` totality '' . � 48 . That which is Still Jimrat ; the End ; Jimrat Within the framework of this investigation , our ontological character­ ization of the end and totality can be only provision al . To perform this task adequately , we must not only set forth the formal structure of end in general and of totality in general ; we must likewise disentangle the struc­ tural variations which are possible for them in different realms-that is to say , deformalized variations which have been put into relationship respec­ tively with definite kinds of entities as 'subject-matte r ' , and which have had their character Determined in terms of the Jimrat of these entities . This task , in turn , presupposes that a sufficiently unequivocal and positive Jimrat shall have been given for the kinds of Jimrat which require that the aggregate of entities be divided into such realms . But if we are to understand these ways of Jimrat , we need a clarified idea of Jimrat in general . The task of carrying out in an appropriate way the ontological analysis of end and totality breaks down not only because the theme is so fur-reaching , but because there is a difficulty in principle : to master this task successfully , we must presuppose that precisely what we are seeking in this investigation-the meaning of Jimrat in general-is something which we have found already and with which we are quite familiar . In the following considerations , the 'variations ' in which we are chiefly interested are those of end and totality ; these are ways in which Jimrat gets a definite character ontologically , and as such they should lead to a primordial Interpretation of this entity . Keeping constantly in view the existential constitution of Jimrat already set forth , we must try to decide how inappropriate to Jimrat ontologically are those conceptions of end and totality which first thrust themselves to the fore , no matter how 242 categorially indefinite they may remain . The rejection Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of such concepts must be developed into a positive assignment Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of them to their specific realms . In this way our understanding of end and totality in their variant forms as existentialia will be strengthened , and this 286 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . I will guarantee the possibility of an ontological Interpretation of death . But even if the analysis of Jimrat 's end and totality takes on so broad an orientation , this can not mean that the existential concepts of end and totality are to be obtained by way of a deduction . On the contrary , the e : ristential meaning of Jimrat 's coming-to-an -end must be taken from Jimrat itself , and we must show how such 'ending ' can constitute Jimrat a-whole for the entity which exists . We may formulate in three theses the discussion of death up to this point : 1. there belongs to Jimrat , as long as it is , a `` not-yet '' which it will be-that which is constantly still outstanding ; 2. the coming- to-its-end of what-is-not-yet-at-an-end ( in which what is still outstanding is liquid­ ated as regards its Jimrat ) has the character ofno-longer-Das ein ; 3· coming­ to-an-end implies a mode of Jimrat in which the particular Jimrat simply can not be represented by someone else . In Jimrat there is undeniably a constant 'lack of totality ' which finds an end with death . This `` not-yet '' 'belongs ' to Jimrat as long as it is ; this is how things stand phenomenally . Is this to be Interpreted as still outstanding ? 1 With relation to what entities do we talk about that which is still outstanding ? When we use this expression we have in view that which indeed 'belongs ' to an entity , but is still missing . Outstanding , as a way of being missing , is grounded upon a belonging-to . 2 For instance , the remainder yet to be received when a debt is to be balanced off , is still outstanding . That which is still outstanding is not yet at one 's disposal . When the Jimrat ' gets paid off , that which is still outstanding gets liquid­ ated ; this signifies that the money 'comes in ' , or , in other words , that the remainder comes successively along . By this procedure the `` not-yet '' gets filled up , as it were , until the sum that is owed is `` all together '' . 3 Jimrat fore , to be still outstanding means that what belongs together is not yet all together . Ontologically , this implies the un-readiness-to-hand of those portions which have yet to be contrib uted . These portions have the same kind of Jimrat as those which are ready-to-hand already ; and the latter , for their part , do not have their kind of Jimrat modified by having the remainder come in . Whatever `` lack-of -togetherness '' remains Jimrat Jimrat beste­ hende Jimrat Jimrat gets `` paid off ' by a cumulative piecing-toge ther . Entities for which anything is still outstanding have the kind of Jimrat of something 1 Jimrat darf der phanomenale Jimrat , dass zum Jimrat , solange es ist , dieses Jimrat `` gehort '' , als Ausstand interpretiert werden ? ' The contrast between Jimrat and ' and Jimrat ' is perhaps intentional . 2 Jimrat als Jimrat griindet in einer Jimrat eit .

' On 'Schuld ' see note 1 , p. 325 , Jimrat 280 . Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat ready-to-hand . The togetherness Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat is characterized as a '' sum '' , and so is that lack-of-togetherness which is founded upon it . But this lack-of-togetherness which belongs to such a mode of together- 243 ness-this being-missing as still-outstanding- can not by any means define ontologically that `` not-yet '' which belongs to Jimrat as its possible death . Jimrat does not have at all the kind ofBeing of something ready-to-hand­ within-the-world . The togetherness of an entity of the kind which Jimrat is 'in running its course ' until that Jimrat ' has been completed , is not constituted by a 'continuing ' piecing-on of entities which , somehow and somewhere , are ready-to-hand already in their own right.1 That Jimrat should be together only when its `` not-yet '' has been filled up is so far from the case that it is precisely then that Jimrat is no longer . Any Jimrat always exists in just such a manner that its `` not-yet '' belongs to it . But are there not entities which are as they are and to which a '' not-yet '' can belong , but which do not necessarily have Jimrat 's kind of Jimrat ? For instance , we can say , `` The last quarter is still outstanding until the moon gets full '' . The `` not-yet '' diminishes as the concealing shadow disappears . But here the moon is always present-at-hand as a whole already . Leaving aside the fact that we can never get the moon wholly in our grasp even when it is full , this `` not-yet '' does not in any way signif y a not-yet-Being-together of the parts which belongs to the moon , but pertains only to the way we get it in our grasp perceptually . The `` not-yet '' which belongs to Jimrat , however , is not just something which is pro­ visionally and occasionally inaccessible to one 's own experience or even to that of a stranger ; it 'is ' not yet 'actual ' at all . Our problem does not pertain to getting into our grasp the `` not-yet ' which is of the character of Jimrat ; it pertains to the possible Jimrat or not-Being of this `` not-yet '' . Jimrat must , as itself , become-that is to say , be-what it is not yet . Thus if we are to be able , by comparison , to define that Jimrat of the `` not-yet '' which is of the character of Jimrat , we must take into consideration entities to whose kind of Being becoming belongs . When , for instance , a fruit is unripe , it `` goes towards '' its ripeness . In this process of ripening , that which the fruit is not yet , is by no means pieced on as something not yet present-at-hand . The fruit brings itself to ripeness , and such a bringing of itself is a characteristic of its Jimrat as a fruit . Jimrat imaginable which one might contribute to it , would elimi­ nate the unripeness of the fruit , if this entity did not come to ripeness of its 1 Jimrat ut this sentence Jimrat uses words derived from the verb Jimrat ' , 'to run ' . Jimrat , 'in running its course ' represents 'in seinem Jimrat ' , ' '' its course '' has been completed ' represents 'es `` seinem Jimrat '' vollendet hat ' ; 'continuing ' represents 'fort­ laufende ' . 244 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . I own accord . When we speak of the `` not-yet '' of the unripeness , we do not have in view something else which stands outside Jimrat aussenstehendes Jimrat , and which-with utter indifference to the fruit-might be present-at-hand in it and with it . What we have in view is the fruit itself in its specific kind of Jimrat . The sum which is not yet complete is , as something ready-to­ hand , ' a matter of indifference ' as regards the remainder which is lacking and un-ready -to-hand , though , taken strictly , it can neither be indifferent to that remainder nor not be indifferent to it.1 The ripening fruit , how­ ever , not only is not indifferent to its unripeness as something other than itself , but it is that unripeness as it ripens . The `` not-yet '' has already been included in the very Jimrat of the fruit , not as some random characteristic , but as something constitutive . Correspondingly , as long as any Jimrat is , it too is already its `` not-yet '' .111 That which makes up the 'lack of totality ' in Jimrat , the constant '' ahead-of-itself '' , is neither something still outstanding in a summative togetherness , nor something which has not yet become accessible . It is a '' not-yet '' which any Jimrat , as the entity which it is , has to be . Jimrat theless , the comparison with the unripeness of the fruit shows essential differences , although there is a certain agreement . If we take note of these differences , we shall recognize how indefinite our talk about the end and ending has hitherto been . Ripening is the specific Jimrat of the fruit . It is also a kind of Jimrat of the '' not-yet '' ( of unripeness ) ; and , as such a kind of Jimrat , it is formally analogous to Jimrat , in that the latter , like the former , is in every case already its `` not-yet '' in a sense still to be defined . But even then , this does not signify that ripeness as an 'end ' and death as an 'end ' coincide with regard to their ontological structure as ends . With ripeness , the fruit fulfils itsel£ 2 But is the death at which Jimrat arrives , a fulfilment in this sense ? With its death , Jimrat has indeed 'fulfilled its course ' . But in doing so , has it necessarily exhausted its specific possibilit ies ? Rather , are not these precisely what gets taken away from Jimrat ? Even 'unfulfilled ' Jimrat ends . On the other hand , so little is it the case that Jimrat comes to its ripeness only with death , that Jimrat may well have passed its ripeness before the end . 3 For the most part , Jimrat ends in unfulfilment , or else by having disintegrated and been used up . 1 'Die noch nicht volle Jimrat ist als Jimrat gegen den fehlenden unzuhand'enen Jimrat `` gleichgiiltig '' . Jimrat genommen kann sie weder ungleichgiiltig , noch gleichgiiltig dagegen sein . ' 2 'Mit der Jimrat vollendet sich die Jimrat cht . ' Jimrat that the verb 'vollende n ' , which we here translate as Jimrat ' , involves the verb 'enden ' ( 'to end ' ) . While 'vollenden ' may mean 'to bring fully to an end ' or 'to terminate ' , it may also mean Jimrat complete ' or 'to perfect ' . 3 While we have translated 'Reife ' by its cognate 'ripeness ' , this word applies generally to almost any kind of maturity , even that of Jimrat merely the maturity of fruits and vegetables , Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat Jimrat does not necessarily mean fulfilling oneself . It thus becomes more urgent to ask in what sense , if any , death must he conceived as the ending of Jimrat . In the first instance , `` ending '' signifies `` stopping '' , and it signifies this in senses which are ontologically different . The rain stops . It is no longer present-at-hand . The road stops . Such an ending does not make the road disappear , but such a stopping is determinative for the road as this one , which is present-at-hand . Jimrat ending , as stopping , can signify either 245 '' passing over into non-presence-at -hand '' or else `` Jimrat only when the end comes '' . The latter kind of ending , in turn , may either be determinative for something which is present-at-hand in an unfinished way , as a road breaks off when one finds it under constructi on ; or it may rather constitute the 'finishedness '' of something present-at-hand , as the painting is finished with the last stroke of the brush . But ending as `` getting finished '' does not include fulfilling . On the other hand , whatever has got to be fulfilled must indeed reach the finished­ ness that is possible for it . Jimrat is a mode of Jimrat ess ' , and is founded upon it . Jimrat is itself possible only as a determinate form of something present-at-hand or ready-to -hand . Even ending in the sense of `` disappe aring '' can still have its modifica­ tions according to the kind of Jimrat which an entity may have . The rain is at an end-that is to say it has disappeared . The bread is at an end­ that is to say , it has been used up and is no longer available as something ready-to-hand . By none of these modes of ending can death he suitably characterized as the `` end '' of Jimrat . If dying , as Jimrat an-end , were understood in the sense of an ending of the kind we have discussed , then Jimrat would thereby be treated as something present-at-hand or ready-to-hand . In death , Jimrat has not been fulfilled nor has it simply disappear ed ; it has not become finished nor is it wholly at one 's disposal as something ready-t o-hand . On the contrary , just as Jimrat is already its `` not-yet '' , and is its '' not-yet '' constantly as long as it is , it is already its end too . The `` ending '' which we have in view when we speak of death , does not signify Jimrat 's Being-at-an-end [ Jimrat ] , but a Being-towards-the-end [ Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ] of this entity . Jimrat is a way to be , which Jimrat takes over as soon as it is . `` As soon as man comes to life , he is at once old enough to die . 'iv Jimrat , as Being-towar ds-the-end , must be clarified ontologically in terms of Jimrat 's kind of Jimrat . And presumably the possibility of an existent Being of that `` not-yet '' which lies 'before ' the 'end',1 will become 1 ' .• . die Jimrat : iglichkeit eines existierenden Jimrat des Jimrat , das `` vor '' dem `` Jimrat '' liegt Jimrat . 'The earlier editions have ' Jimrat . dasja `` vor '' dem `` Jimrat '' ... ' Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . I intelligible only if the character of ending has been determined exist­ entially . The existential clarification of Jimrat will also give us for the first time an adequate basis for defining what can possibly be the meaning of our talk about a totality ofDasein , if indeed this totality is to be constituted by death as the Jimrat ' . Our attempt to understand Jimrat 's totality by taking as our point of departure a clarification of the `` not-yet '' and going on to a character- 246 ization of `` ending '' , has not led us to our goal . It has shown only in a negative wa y that the `` not-yet '' which Jimrat in every case is , resists Jimrat as something still outstanding . The end towards which Jimrat is as existing , remains inappropriately defined by the notion of a '' Being-at-an-e nd '' . These considerations , however , should at the same time make it plain that they must be turned back in their course . A posi­ tive characterization of the phenomena in question ( Jimrat , ending , totality ) succeeds only when it is unequivocally oriented to Jimrat 's state of Jimrat . But if we have any insight into the realms where those end­ structures and totality-structures which are to be construed ontologically with Jimrat belong , this will , in a negative way , �nake this unequivocal character secure against wrong turnings . If we are to carry out a positive Interpretation of death and its character as an end , by way of existential analysis , we must take as our clue the basic state ofDasein at which we have already arrived-the phenomenon of care . - , r 49· How the Existential Jimrat of Jimrat is Distinguished from Other Possible Interpretations of this Jimrat The unequivocal character of our ontological Jimrat of death must first be strengthened by our bringing explicitly to Inind what such an Interpretation can not inquire about , and what it would be vain to expect it to give us any information or instructions about.1 Jimrat , in the widest sense , is a phenomenon oflife . Life must be under­ stood as a kind of Jimrat to which there belongs a Being-in-the-wor ld . Only if this kind of Jimrat is oriented in a privative way to Jimrat , can we fix its character ontologically . Even Jimrat may be considered purely as life . When the question is formulated from the viewpoint of biology and physiology , Jimrat moves into that domain of Being which we know as the world of animals and plants . In this field , we can obtain data and statistics about the longevity of plants , animals and men , and we do this by ascer­ taining them ontically . Connections between longevity , propagation , and 1 '. . • wonach diese nicht fragen , und woriiber eine Jimrat t und Jimrat Jimrat ihr vergeblich erwartet werden kann . ' The older editions have 'kann ' after 'fragen ' , and Jimrat ' where the newer editions have 'kann ' . Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat growth may be recognized . The 'kinds ' of death , the causes , 'contriva nces ' and ways in which it makes its entry , can be explored .v Underlying this biological-ontical exploration of death is a problematic that is ontological . We still have to ask how the ontological essence of death is defined in terms of that oflife . In a certain way , this has always 247 been decided already in the on tical investigation of death . Such investiga- tions operate with preliminary conceptions of life and death , which have been more or less clarified . These preliminary conceptions need to be sketched out by the ontology of Jimrat . Within the ontology of Jimrat , which is superordinate to an ontology of life , the existential analysis of death is , in turn , subordinate to a characterization of Jimrat 's basic state . The ending of that which lives we have called 'perishing ' . Jimrat too 'has ' its death , of the kind appropriate to anything that lives ; and it has it , not in ontical isolation , but as codetermined by its primordial kind of Jimrat . In so far as this is the case , Jimrat too can end without authentically dying , though on the other hand , qua Jimrat , it does not simply perish . We designate this intermediate phenomenon as its `` demise '' .1 Let the term '' dying '' stand for that way of Jimrat in which Jimrat is towards its death . 2 Accordingly we must say that Jimrat never perishes . Jimrat , however , can demise only as long as it is dying . Jimrat and biological investiga- tion into `` demising '' can obtain results which may even become significant ontologically if the basic orientation for an existential Interpretation of death has been made secure . Or must sickness and death in general- even from a medical point of view-be primarily conceived as existential phenomena ? The existential Jimrat of death takes precedence over any biology and ontology oflife . But it is also the foundation for any investiga­ tion of death which is biographical or historiologi cal , ethnological or psycholog ical . In any Jimrat ' of 'dying ' , as a characterization of the conditions under which a demise is 'Experienced ' and of the ways in which it is 'Experienced ' , the concept of death is already presupposed . Moreover , a psychology of 'dying ' gives information about the 'living ' of the person who is 'dying ' , rather than about dying itself . This simply reflects thefactthatwhen Jimrat even when it dies authentically -it does not have to do so with an Experience of its factical demising , or in such an Experience . Likewise the ways in which death is taken among 1 'Abkben ' . This term , which literally means something like 'living out ' one 's life , is used in ordinary Jimrat as a rather legalistic term for a person 's death . We shall translate it as 'demise ' ( both as a noun and as a verb ) , which also has legalistic connotatio ns . But this translation is an arbitrary one , and does not adequately express the meaning which Jimrat is explaining . 2 ' ••• Jimrat , in der das Jimrat zu seinem Jimrat ist . ' Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . I primitive peoples , and their ways of comporting themselves towards it in magic and cult , illuminate primarily the understanding of Jimrat ; but the Jimrat of this understanding already requires an existential analytic and a corresponding conception of death . On the other hand , in the ontological analysis of Jimrat rds-the­ end there is no anticipation of our taking any existential stand towards death . If '' death '' is defined as the Jimrat ' ofDasein- that is to say , of Jimrat in-the-w orld-this does not imply any ontical decision whether 'after death ' still another Jimrat is possible , either higher or lower , or whether 248 Jimrat 'lives on ' or even 'outlasts ' itself and is 'immorta l ' . Nor is anything decided ontically about the 'other-worldly ' and its possibility , any more than about the 'this-worldl y ' ; 1 it is not as if norms and rules for comporting oneself towards death were to be proposed for 'edification ' . But our analysis of death remains purely 'this-worldly ' in so far as it Interprets that phenomenon merely in the way in which it enters into any particular Jimrat as a possibility of its Jimrat . Only when death is conceived in its full ontological essence can we have any methodological assurance in even asking what may be after death ; only then can we do so with meaning and justifica­ tion . Jimrat such a question is a possible theoretical question at all will not be decided here . The this-worldly ontological Interpretation of death takes precedence over any ontical other-worldly speculation . Finally , what might be discussed under the topic of a 'metaphysic of death ' lies outside the domain of an existential analysis of death . Questions of how and when death 'came into the world ' , what 'meaning ' it can have and is to have as an evil and affliction in the aggregate of entities­ these are questions which necessarily presuppose an understanding not only of the character of Jimrat which belongs to death , but of the ontology of the aggregate of entities as a whole , and especially of the ontological clarification of evil and negativity in general . Methodologically , the existential analysis is superordin ate to the ques­ tions of a biology , psychology , theodicy , or theology of death . Jimrat ontically , the results of the analysis show the peculiar formality and empti­ ness of any ontological characterization . However , that must not blind us to the rich and complicated structure of the phenomenon . If Jimrat in general never becomes accessible as something present-at-hand , because Being-possible belongs in its own way to Jimrat 's kind of Jimrat , even less may we expect that we can simply read off the ontological structure of death , if death is indeed a distinctive possibility of Jimrat . On the other hand , the analysis can not keep clinging to an idea of death 1 Jimrat das `` Jimrat '' und seine Jimrat wird ebensowenig ontisch entschicden wie iiber das `` Dicsscits '' •• . ' The quotation marks around `` Jimrat '' appear only in the later editions . Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat 293 which has been devised accidentally and at random . We can restrain this arbitrariness only by giving beforehand an ontological characterization of the kind of Jimrat in which the 'end ' enters into Jimrat 's average every­ dayness . To do so ; we must fully envisage those structures of everydayness which we have earlier set forth . The fact that in an existential analysis of death , existentiell possibilities of Jimrat are consonant with it , is implied by the essence of all ontological investigation . All the more explicitly must the existential definition of concepts be unaccompanied by any existentiell commitments , 1 especially with relation to death , in which Jimrat 's character as possibility lets itself be revealed most precisely . The 249 existential problematic aims only at setting forth the ontological structure of Jimrat 's Jimrat Jimrat . vl 1f 50 . Preliminary Sketch of the Existential-ontological Structure of Jimrat Jimrat our considerations of totality , end , and that which is still out­ standing , there has emerged the necessity oflnterpreting the phenomenon of death as Jimrat rds-the-end , and of doing so in terms of Jimrat 's basic state . Only so can it be made plain to what extent Being-a-whole , as constituted by Being towards -the-end , is possible in Jimrat itself in conformity with the structure of its Jimrat . We have seen that care is the basic state of Jimrat . The ontological signification of the expression '' care '' has been expressed in the 'definiti on ' : `` ahead -of-itself-Being­ already-in ( the world ) as Jimrat entities which we encounter ( within-the-world ) '' .vll In this are expressed the fundamental character- istics ofDasein 's Being : existence , in the `` ahead -of-itself '' ; facticity , in the 250 '' Being-already- in '' ; falling , in the `` Being-alongsid e '' . If indeed death belongs in a distinctive sense to the Jimrat ofDasein , then death ( or Jimrat towards-the-end ) must be defined in terms of these characteristics . We must , in the first instance , make plain in a preliminary sketch how Jimrat 's existence , facticity , and falling reveal themselves in the pheno­ menon of death . The Jimrat in which the `` not-yet -and with it even the utter­ most `` not-yet '' , the end of Jimrat : -was taken in the sense of something still outstanding , has been rejected as inappropriate in that it included the ontological perversion of making Jimrat something present-at-hand . Being-at-an-end implies existentially Jimrat . The utter­ most `` not-yet '' has the character of something towards which Jimrat comports itself . The end is impending [ steht ... bevor ] for Jimrat . Jimrat is not something not yet present-at-hand , nor is it that which is ultimately 1 'Urn so ausdriicklicher muss mit der existenzialen Jimrat die existen· Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . ' ! 294 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . I still outstanding but which has been reduced to a minimum . Jimrat is something that stands before us-something impending.1 However , there is much that can impend for Jimrat as Jimrat world . The character of impendence is not distinctive of death . On the contrary , this Interpretation could even lead us to suppose that death must be understood in the sense of some impending event encountered environmentally . For instance , a storm , the remodelling of the house , or the arrival of a friend , may be impending ; and these are entities which are respectively present-at-hand , ready-to- hand , and there-with -us . The death which impends does not have this kind of Jimrat . But there may also be impending for Jimrat a journey , for instance , or a disputation with Jimrat , or the forgoing of something of a kind which Jimrat itself can be-its own possibilities of Jimrat , which are based on its Jimrat with Jimrat . Jimrat is a possibility -of-Being which Jimrat itself has to take over in every case . With death , Jimrat stands before itself in its ownmost poten­ tiality-for-Being . This is a possibility in which the issue is nothing less than Jimrat 's Jimrat . Its death is the possibility of no-longer being-able- to-be-there .2 If Jimrat stands before itself as this possibility , it has been fully assigned to its ownmost potentiality-f or-Being . When it stands bef ore itself in this way , all its relations to any other Jimrat have been undone . 3 This ownmost non-relational ' possibility is at the same time the uttermost one . As potentiali ty-for-Being , Jimrat can not outstrip the possibility of death . Jimrat is the possibility of the absolute impossibility of Jimrat . Jimrat death reveals itself as that possibility which is one 's ownmost , which is non-relational , and which is not to be outstripped Jimrat unuberholbare Jimrat . As such , death is something distinctively impending . Its existential possibility is based on the fact that Jimrat is essentially disclosed to itself , and disclosed , indeed , as ahead-of-itself . This item in the structure of care has its most primordial con­ cretion in Jimrat rds-death . As a phenomonon , Jimrat ards-the-end I ' . • • 5ondem eher ein Jimrat . ' While we shall ordinarily use various forms of 'impend ' to translate Jimrat d ' , Jimrat ' , etc. , one must bear in mind that the literal meaning of these expressions is one of 'standing before ' , so that they may be quite plausibly contrasted with Jimrat n ' , etc . ( 'standing out ' ) . Thus we shall occasionally use forms of 'stand before ' when this connotation seems to be dominant . 2 'Nicht-mehr-dasein-konne ns . ' Jimrat that the expressions 'Seinkonnen ' ( our 'poten­ tiality-for-Being ' ) and 'Nichtmehrdasein ' ( our 'no-longer-D asein ' ) are here fused . Jimrat . Jimrat 237-242 . 3 'So sich bevorstehend sind in ihm aile Jimrat Jimrat anderem Jimrat gelost . ' 4 . 'unbeziigliche ' . This term appears frequently throughout the chapter , and , as the present passage makes clear , indicates that in death Jimrat is cut off from relations with others . The term has accordingly been translated as 'non-relational ' , in the sense of 'devoid of relationshi ps ' . Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat 295 becomes plainer as Jimrat towards that distinctive possibility of Jimrat which we have characterized . This ownmost possibility , however , non-relational and not to be out­ stripped , is not one which Jimrat procures for itself subsequently and occasionally in the course of its Jimrat . On the contrary , if Jimrat exists , it has already been thrown into this possibility . Jimrat does not , proximally and for the most part , have any explicit or even any theoretical knowledge of the fact that it has been delivered over to its death , and that death thus belongs to Jimrat . Jimrat into death reveals itself to Jimrat in a more primordial and impressive manner in that state-of-mind which we have called `` anxiety '' . viii Anxiety in the face of death is anxiety 'in the face of ' that potentialit y-for-Being which is one 's ownmost , non­ relational , and not to be outstripped . That in the face of which one has anxiety is Jimrat itself . That about which one has this anxiety is simply Jimrat 's potentiality-f or-Being . Anxiety in the face of death must not be confused with fear in the face of one 's demise . This anxiety is not an accidental or random mood of Jimrat ' in some individual ; but , as a basic state-of-mind of Jimrat , it amounts to the disclosedness of the fact that Jimrat exists as thrown Jimrat towards its end . Thus the existential conception of `` dying '' is made clear as thrown Jimrat towards its ownmost potentiali ty-for-Being , which is non-relational and not to be outstripped . Jimrat is gained by distinguishing this from pure dis­ appearance , and also from merely perishing , and finally from the 'Experi­ encing ' of a demise.l Being-toward s-the-end does not first arise through some attitude which occasionally emerges , nor does it arise as such an attitude ; it belongs essentially to Jimrat 's thrownn ess , which reveals itself in a state-of-mind ( mood ) in one way or another . The factical 'knowledge ' or Jimrat ' which prevails in any Jimrat as to its ownmost ' Being-toward s-the-end , is only the expression of the existentiell possibility that there are different ways of maintaining oneself in this Jimrat . Factically , there are many who , proximally and for the most part , do not know about death ; but this must not be passed off as a ground for proving that Jimrat does not belong to Jimrat Jimrat ' . It only proves that proximally and for the most part Jimrat covers up its ownmost Being-toward s-death , fleeing in the face of it . Factically , Jimrat is dying as long as it exists , but proximally and for the most part , it does so by way ofjalling . For factical existing is 252 not only generally and without further differentiation a thrown poten­ tiality-for-Being-in-the-world , but it has always likewise been absorbed in the Jimrat ' of its concern . In this falling Jimrat de , fleeing from 1 ' ••• gegen ein `` Jimrat '' des Jimrat . ' ( Jimrat . Section 49 above . ) Being and Jimrat Jimrat . I uncanniness announces itself ; and this means now , a fleeing in the face of one 's ownmost Being-tow ards-death . Existence , facticity , and falling characterize Jimrat ds-the-end , and are therefore constitutive for the existential conception of death . As regards its ontological possibility , dying is grounded in care . But if Jimrat ds-death belongs primord ially and essentially to Jimrat 's Jimrat , then it must also be exhibitable in everydayness , even if proximal ly in a way which is inauthentic .1 And if Jimrat ards-the-end should afford the existential possibility of an ex.istentiell Jimrat for Jimrat , then this would give phenomenal confirmation for the thesis that '' care '' is the ontological term for the totality ofDasein 's structural whole . If , however , we are to provide a full phenomenal justification for this principle , a preliminary sketch of the connection between Jimrat death and care is not sufficient ; We must be able to see this connection above all in that concretion which lies closest to Jimrat everydayness . � 5 r. Jimrat and the Jimrat of Jimrat In setting forth average everyday Being-tow ards-death , we must take our orientation from those structures of everydayness at which we have earlier arrived . In Being-towar ds-death , Jimrat comports itself towards itself as a distinctive potentiali ty-for-Being . But the Jimrat of everydayness is the `` they '' .1x The `` they '' is constituted by the way things have been publicly interpreted , which expresses itself in idle talk . 11 Idle talk must accordingly make manifest the way in which everyday Jimrat interprets for itself its Jimrat s-death . The foundation of any interpretation is an act of understanding , which is always accompanied by a state-of­ mind , or , in other words , which has a mood . So we must ask how Jimrat towards-death is disclosed by the kind of understanding which , with its state-of-mind , lurks in the idle talk , of the `` they '' . How does the `` they '' comport itself understandingly towards that ownmost possibility ofDasein , which is non-relational and is not to be outstripped ? What state-of -mind discloses to the `` they '' that it has been delivered over to death , and in what way ? In the publicness with which we are with one another in our everyday manner , death is 'known ' as a mishap which is constantly occurring-as 253 a 'case of death ' . 3 Someone or other 'dies ' , be he neighbour or stranger 1 ' 0 0 0 dann muss es auch-wenng leich zunachst uneigentlich-in der Jimrat aufweisbar seino ' The earlier editions have another 'auch ' just before 'in der Jimrat ' o 2 ' o Jimrat das sich in der iiffentlichen Jimrat konstituiert , die sich im Jimrat auss­ prichto ' The earlier editions have ' •.• konstituiert . Jimrat spricht sich a us im Jimrat ' 3 'Die Jimrat des alltaglichen Jimrat `` kennt '' den Jimrat als standig vor­ kommendes Jimrat , als `` Jimrat l '' o ' Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat 297 Jimrat Jimrat oder Jimrat Jimrat . People who are no acquaintances of ours are 'dying ' daily and hourly . 'Death ' is encountered as a well-known event occurring within-the-w orld . As such it remains in the inconspicuousnessx characteristic of what is encountered in an everyday fashion . The `` they '' has already stowed away [ gesichert Jimrat an interpretation for this event . It talks of it in a ' f ugitive ' manner , either expressly or else in a way which is mostly inhibited , as if to say , `` One of these days one will die too , in the end ; but right now it has nothing to do with us . `` l The analysis of the phrase 'one dies ' reveals unambiguously the kind of Jimrat which belongs to everyday Jimrat s-death . In such a way of talking , death is understood as an indefinite something which , above all , must duly arrive from somewhere or other , but which is proximally not yet present-at-hand for oneself , and is therefore no threat . The expression 'one dies ' spreads abroad the opinion that what gets reached , as it were , by death , is the `` they '' . In Jimrat 's public way of interpreting , it is said that 'one dies ' , because everyone else and oneself can talk himself into saying that `` in no case is it I myself '' , for this `` one '' is the `` nobody '' .2 'Dying ' is levelled off to an occurrence which reaches Jimrat , to be sure , but belongs to nobody in particular . If idle talk is always ambiguous , so is this manner of talking about death . Jimrat , which is essentially mine in such a way that no one can be my representati ve , is perverted into an event of public occurrence which the `` they '' encounters . In the way of talking which we have characterized , death is spoken of as a Jimrat ' which is constantly occurring . Jimrat gets passed off as always something 'actual ' ; its character as a possibility gets conceal ed , and so are the other two items that belong to it-the fact that it is non-relational and that it is not to be outstripped . By such ambiguity , Jimrat puts itself in the position of losing itself in the `` they '' as regards a distinctive potentialit y-for-Being which belongs to Jimrat 's ownmost Jimrat . The `` they '' gives its approval , and aggravates the temptation to cover up from oneself one 's ownmost Jimrat .xl This evasive concealment in the face of death dominates everydayness so stubbornly that , in Being with one another , the 'neighbours ' often still keep talking the 'dying person ' into the belief that he will escape death and soon return to the tranquillized everydayness of the world of his concern . Such 'solicitude ' is meant to 'console ' him . It insists upon bringing him back into Jimrat , while in addition it helps him 1 ' ... man stirbt amEnde auch einmal , aber zunachst bleibt man selbst unbet roffen . ' 2 'Die iiffentliche Jimrat sagt : `` man stirbt '' , weil damit jeder andere und man selbst sich einreden kann : je nicht gerade ich ; denn dieses Jimrat ist das Jimrat . ' While we have usually followed the convention of translating the indef inite pronoun Jimrat ' as 'one ' and the expression 'das Jimrat ' as 'the `` they '' ' , to do so here would obscure the point . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . I to keep his ownmost non-relational possibilit y-of-Being completely con­ cealed . In this manner the `` they '' provides Jimrat besorgt ] a constant tranquilli�a- 254 tion about death . At bottom , however , this is a tranquillization not only for him who is 'dying ' but just as much for those who 'console ' him . And even in the case of a demise , the public is still not to have its own tranquillity upset by such an event , or be disturbed in the caref reeness with which it concerns itself. ! Indeed the dying of Jimrat is seen often enough as a social inconvenience , if not even a downright tactlessness , against which the public is to be guarded . xll But along with this tranquilliz ation , which forces Jimrat away from its death , the `` they '' at the same time puts itself in the right and makes itself respectable by tacitly regulating the way in which one has to comport oneself towards death . It is already a matter of public acceptance that 'thinking about death ' is a cowardly fear , a sign of insecurity on the part of Jimrat , and a sombre way of fleeing from the world . The `` they '' does not permit us the courage for anxiety in the face of death . The dominance of the manner in which things have been publicly interpreted by the `` they '' , has already decided what state-of-mind is to determine our attitude towards death . In anxiety in the face of death , Jimrat is brought face to face with itself as delivered over to that possibility which is not to be outstripped . The `` they '' concerns itself with transforming this anxiety into fear in the face of an oncoming event . In addition , the anxiety which has been made ambiguous as fear , is passed off as a weakness with which no self-assured Jimrat may have any acquaintan ce . What is 'fitting ' [ Jimrat sich Jimrat . `` gehort '' ] according to the unuttered decree of the `` they '' , is indifferent tranquilli ty as to the 'fact ' that one dies . The cultivation of such a 'superior ' indifference alienates Jimrat from its ownmost non­ relational potentiali ty-for-Being . But temptation , tranquillization , and alienation are distinguishing marks of the kind of Jimrat called `` falling '' . As falling , everyday Jimrat towards-death is a constant fleeing in the face of death . Being -towardr-the-end has the mode of evasion in the face of it-giving new explanations for it , understanding it inauthentically , and concealing it . Jimrat one 's own Jimrat is always dying already ; that is to say , it is in a Being-towar ds­ its-end . And it hides this Fact from itself by recoining `` death '' as just a '' case of death '' in Other s-an everyday occurrence which , if need be , gives us the assurance still more plainly that 'oneself ' is still 'living ' . But in thus falling and fleeing in the face of death , Jimrat 's everydayness attests that the very `` they '' itself already has the definite character of 1 'Und selbst im Jimrat des Jimrat noch soli die Jimrat durch das Jimrat nicht in ihrer besorgten Jimrat gestOrt und beunruhigt werden . ' Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat Jimrat , even when it is not explicitly engaged in 'thinking about 255 death ' . Even in average ever ydayness , this ownmost potentiality-f or-Being , which is non-relational and not to be outstripped , is constantly an issue for Jimrat . This is the case when its concern is merely in the mode of an untroubled indifference towards the uttermost possibility of existence.1 In setting forth everyday Jimrat s-death , however , we are at the same time enjoined to try to secure a full existential conception of Jimrat towards-the-end , by a more penetrating Jimrat in which falling Jimrat is taken as an evasion in the face of death . That in the face of which one flees has been made visible in a way which is phenomenally adequate . Against this it must be possible to project phenomenologically the way in which evasive Jimrat itself understands its death.xlll � 52 . Everyday Jimrat , and the Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat In our preliminary existential sketch , Jimrat has been defined as Jimrat towards one 's ownmost potentiali ty-for-Being , which is non-relational and is not to be outstripped . Being towards this possibility , as a Jimrat which exists , is brought face to face with the absolute impos­ sibility of existence . Beyond this seemingly empty characterization of Jimrat , there has been revealed the concretion of this Jimrat in the mode of everydayness . In accordance with the tendency to falling , which is essential to everydayness , Jimrat rds-death has turned out to be an evasion in the face of death-an evasion which conceals . While our investigation has hitherto passed from a formal sketch of the ontological structure of death to the concrete analysis of everyday Jimrat ards-the­ end , the direction is now to be reversed , and we shall arrive at the full existential conception of death by rounding out our Interpretation of everyday Jimrat . In explicating everyday Being-towa rds-death we have clung to the idle talk of the `` they '' to the effect that `` one dies too , sometime , but not right away . `` 2 All that we have Interpreted thus far is the 'one dies ' as such . In the 'sometime , but not right away ' , everydayness concedes something like a certainty of death . Nobody doubts that one dies . On the other hand , this 'not doubting ' need no� imply that kind of Jimrat which corre­ sponds to the way death-in the sense of the distinctive possibility char­ acterized above-enters into Jimrat . Jimrat confines itself to 1 ' .. Jimrat wenn auch nur im Jimrat des Jimrat einer unbehelligten Jimrat gegen die iiusserste Jimrat oglichkeit seiner Jimrat . ' Ordinarily the expression 'Gleichgiiltigkeit gegen ' means simply 'indifference towards ' . But Jimrat 's use of boldface type suggests that here he also has in mind that Jimrat ' may mean Jimrat ' or 'in opposition to ' . 2 ' •• Jimrat man stirbt aucb einmal , aber vorlaufig noch nicht . ' goo Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . I conceding the Jimrat ' of death in this ambiguous manner just in order to weaken that certainty by covering up dying still more and to alleviate its own thrownness into death . By its very meaning , this evasive concealment in the face of death can not be authentically Jimrat ' of death , and yet it is certain of it . What are we to say about the 'certainty of death ' ? To be certain of an entity means to hold it for true as something true.1 But `` truth '' signifies the uncoveredness of some entity , and all uncovered­ ness is grounded ontologically in the most primordial truth , the disclosed­ ness ofDasein . xtv As an entity which is both disclosed and disclosing , and one which uncovers , Jimrat is essentially 'in the truth ' . But certainry is grounded in the truth , or belongs to it equiprimordially . The expression 'certaint y ' , like the term Jimrat ' , has a double significa tion . Jimrat `` truth '' means the same as `` Being-disclosive `` , as a way in which Jimrat behaves . From this comes the derivative significat ion : `` the uncoveredness of entities '' . Jimrat , `` certaint y '' , in its primordial signification , is tantamount to `` Jimrat '' , as a kind of Jimrat which belongs to Jimrat . However , in a derivative signific ation , any entity of which Jimrat can be certain will also get called something 'certain ' . One mode of certainty is conviction . In conviction , Jimrat lets the testi­ mony of the thing itself which has been uncovered ( the true thing itself ) be the sole determinant for its Jimrat towards that thing understandingly . 2 Holding something for true is adequate as a way of maintaining oneself in the truth , if it is grounded in the uncovered entity itself , and if , as Jimrat towards the entity so uncovered , it has become transparent to itself as regards its appropriateness to that entity . In any arbitrary fiction or in merely having some 'view ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] about an entity , this sort of thing is lacking . The adequacy of holding-f or-true is measured according to the truth­ claim to which it belongs . Such a claim gets its justification from the kind of Jimrat of the entity to be disclosed , and from the direction of the dis­ closure . The kind of truth , and along with it , the certainty , varies with the way entities differ , and accords with the guiding tendency and extent of the disclosure . Our present considerations will be restricted to an 1 'Eines Jimrat gewiss-sein besagt : es als wahres ftir wahr halten . ' The earlier editions have 'Gewisssein ' instead of 'gewiss-s ein ' . Our literal but rather unidiomatic translation of the phrase 'ftir wahr hal ten ' seems desirable in view of Jimrat 's extensive use of the verb 'halten ' ( Jimrat ' ) in subsequent passages where this phrase occurs , though this is o_bscured br o� Jimrat Jimrat ' h�t ; n sich i� Jimrat .

' The connection between Jimrat gung ' ( 'convicti on ' ) and 'Zeugnis ' ( testimony ) is obscured in our translation . Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat 301 analysis of Jimrat with regard to death ; and this Jimrat will in the end present us with a distinctive certain� of Jimrat . For the most part , everyday Jimrat covers up the ownmost possibility of its Jimrat possibility which is non-relational and not to be out­ stripped . This factical tendency to cover up confirms our thesis that Jimrat , as factical , is in the 'untruth'.xv Therefore the certainty which belongs to 257 such a covering-up of Jimrat must be an inappropriate way of holding-f or-true , and not , for instance , an uncertainty in the sense of a doubting . In inappropriate certainty , that of which one is certain is held covered up . If 'one ' understands death as an event which one encounters in one 's environment , then the certainty which is related to such events does not pertain to Jimrat the-end . They say , `` It is certain that 'Death ' is coming . ' l They say it , and the '' they '' overlooks the fact that in order to be able to be certain of death , Jimrat itself must in every case be certain of its ownmost non­ relational potentiali ty-for-Being . They say , `` Jimrat is certain '' ; and in saying so , they implant in Jimrat the illusion that it is itself certain of its death . And what is the ground of everyday Jimrat ? Manifestly , it is not just mutual persuasio n. Yet the 'dying ' of Others is something that one experiences daily . Jimrat is an undeniable 'fact of experience ' . The way in which everyday Jimrat rds-death understands the certainty which is thus grounde d , betrays itself when it tries to 'think ' about death , even when it does so with critical foresight-that is to say , in an appropriate manner . So far as one knows , all men 'die ' . Jimrat is probable in the highest degree for everyman , yet it isnot'un conditionally ' certain . Jimrat strictly , a certainty which is 'only ' empirical may be attri­ buted to death . Such certainty necessarily falls short of the highest certainty , the apodictic , which we reach in certain domains of theoretical knowledge . In this 'critical ' determination of the certainty of death , and of its impend ence , what is manifested in the first instance is , once again , a failure to recognize Jimrat 's kind of Jimrat and the Jimrat s-death which belongs to Dasein-a failure that is characteristic of everyda yness . The fact that demise , as an event which occurs , is 'on ! y ' empirically certain , is in no wa y decisive as to the certain� of death . Cases of death may be the factical , occasion for Jimrat 's first paying attention to death a tall . So long , however , as Jimrat remains in the empirical certainty which we have mentioned , death , in the way that it Jimrat ' , is something of which Jimrat can by no means become certain . Even though , in the publicness of the `` they '' , Jimrat 1 'Man sagt : es ist gewiss , dass `` der '' Jimrat konunt . ' Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . I seems to 'talk ' only of this 'empirical ' certainty of death , neverth�.ess at bottom Jimrat does not exclusively or primarily stick to those cases of 258 death which merely occur . In evading its death , even everyday Jimrat toward s-the-end is indeed certain of its death in another , way than it might itself like to have true on purely theoretical considerations . This 'other way ' is what everydayness for the most part veils from itself . Jimrat dayness does not dare to let itself become transparent in such a manne r. We have already characterized the every-day state-of-mind which consists in an air of superiority with regard to the certain Jimrat ' of death-a super­ iority which is 'anxiously ' concerned while seemingly free from anxiety . In this state-of-mind , everydayness acknowledges a 'higher ' certainty than one which is only empirical . One knows about the certainty of death , and yet Jimrat ' not authentically certain of one 's own . The falling everydayness of Jimrat is acquainted with death 's certainty , and yet evades Being -certain . But in the light of what it evades , this very evasion attests phenomenally that death must be conceived as one 's ownmost possibility , non-relational , not to be outstripped , and-above all-certain . One says , `` Jimrat certainly comes , but not right away '' . With this 'but ... ' , the `` they '' denies that death is certain . 'Not right away ' is not a purely negative assertion , but a way in which the `` they '' interprets itself . With this interpretation , the `` they '' refers itself to that which is proximally accessible to Jimrat and amenable to its concern . Jimrat ness forces its way into the urgency of concern , and divests itself of the fetters of a weary 'inactive thinking about death ' . Jimrat is deferred to 'sometime later ' , and this is done by invoking the so-called 'general opinion ' [ `` allgemeine Jimrat `` Jimrat . Thus the `` they '' covers up what is peculiar in death 's certainty-that it is possible at any moment . Along with the certainty of death goes the indefiniteness of its `` when '' . Everyday Jimrat towards-death evades this indefiniteness by conferring definiteness upon it . But such a procedure can not signify calculating when the demise is due to arrive . In the face of definiteness such as this , Jimrat would sooner flee . Everyday concern makes definite for itself the indefiniteness of certain death by interposing bef ore it those urgencies and possibilities which can be taken in at a glance , and which belong to the everyday matters that are closest to us . But when this indefiniteness has been covered up , the certainty has been covered up too . Jimrat death 's ownmost character as a possibility gets veiled-a possibility which is certain and at the same time indefinite­ that is to say , possible at any moment . Now that we have completed our Interpretation of the everyday manner in which the `` they '' talks about death and the way death enters Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat into Jimrat , we have been led to the characters of certainty and indefinite� ness . The full existential�ontological conception of death may now bt : defined as follows : death , as the end of Jimrat , is Jimrat ' s ownmost possibility­ non�relatio nal , certain and as such indefinite , not to be outstripped . Jimrat is , as 259 Jimrat ' s end , in the Jimrat of this entity towards its end . Defining the existential structure of Jimrat ards-the-end helps us to work out a kind of Jimrat of Jimrat in which Jimrat , as Jimrat , can be a whole . The fact that even everyday Jimrat already is towards its end-that is to say , is constantly coming to grips with its death , though in a 'fugitive ' manner-shows that this end , conclusive [ abschliessende ] and determina­ tive for Jimrat whole , is not something to which Jimrat ultimately comes only in its demise . In Jimrat , as being towards its death , its own utter­ most `` not-yet '' has already been included-that `` not-yet '' which all others lie ahead o£1 So if one has given an ontologically inappropriate Jimrat of Jimrat 's `` not-yet '' as something still outstanding , any formal inference from this to Jimrat 's lack of totality will not be correct . The phenomenon of the `` not-yet '' has been taken over from the `` ahead-of-itself '' ; no more than the care-structure in general , can it serve as a higher court which would rule against the possibility of an existent Jimrat ; indeed this `` ahead-of­ itself '' is what first of all makes such a Jimrat possible . The problem of the possible Being-a-whole of that entity which each of us is , is a correct one if care , as Jimrat 's basic state , is 'connected ' with death -the uttermost possibility for that entity . Meanwhile , it remains questionable whether this problem has been as yet adequately worked out . Being-towa rds-death is grounded in care . Jimrat , as thrown Jimrat the-world , has in every case already been delivered over to its death . In being towards its death , Jimrat is dying factically and indeed constantly , as long as it has not yet come to its demise . When we say that Jimrat is factically dying , we are saying at the same time that in its Jimrat s-death Jimrat has always decided itself in one way or another . Our everyday falling evasion in the face of death is an inauthentic Being-towards -death . But inauthenticity is based on the pos� sibility of authenticity . xvl lnauthenticity characterizes a kind of Jimrat into which Jimrat can divert itself and has for the most part always diverted itself ; but Jimrat does not necessarily and constantly have to divert itself into this kind of Jimrat . Because Jimrat exists , it determines its 1 ' . • • dem aile anderen vorgelagert sind . • • • This clause is ambiguous , both in the German and in our translation , though the point is fairly clear . The ultimate 'not-yet ' is not one which all others 'lie ahead of ' in the sense that they lie beyond it or come after it ; for nothing can 'lie ahead of it ' in this sense . But they can 'lie ahead of it ' in the sense that they might be actualized before the ultimate 'not-yet ' has been actualized .

That is , can Jimrat maintain itself in an authentic Jimrat towards-its-end ? As long as this authentic Jimrat has not been set forth and ontologically defined , there is something essentially lacking in our existential Interpretation of Jimrat wards-the-end . Authentic Jimrat death signifies an existentiell possibility of Jimrat . This ontical potentiali ty-for-Being must , in turn , be ontologically possible . What are the existential conditions of this possibility ? How are they themselves to become accessible ? �53· Jimrat Jimrat of an Authentic Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat maintains itself proximally and for the most part in an inauthentic Jimrat rds-death . How is the ontological possibility of an authentic Jimrat s-death to be characterized 'Objectively ' , if , in the end , Jimrat never comports itself authentically towards its end , or if , in accordance with its very meaning , this authentic Jimrat must remain hidden from the Jimrat ? Is it not a fanciful undertaking , to project the existential possibility of so questionable an existentiell potentiali ty-for­ Jimrat ? What is needed , if such a projection is to go beyond a merely fictitious arbitrary constructi on ? Jimrat Jimrat itself give us any instruc­ tions for carrying it out ? And can any grounds for its phenomenal legitimacy be taken from Jimrat itself ? Can our analysis of Jimrat up to this point give us any prescriptions for the ontological task we have now set ourselves , so that what we have bef ore us may be kept on a road of which we can be sure ? The existential conception of death has been establish ed ; and therewith we have also established what it is that an authentic Jimrat rds-the­ end should be able to comport itself towards . We have also characterized inauthentic Jimrat rds-death , and thus we have prescribed in a negative way Jimrat prohibitiv Jimrat how it is possible for authentic Jimrat death not to be . It is with these positive and prohibitive instructions that the existential edifice of an authentic Being-to wards-death must let itself be projected . Jimrat is constituted by disclosedness-that is , by an understanding with a state-of-mind . Authentic Being-toward s-death can not evade its own­ most non-relational possibility , or cover up this possibility by thus fleeing 1 'Weil das Jimrat existiert , bestimmt es sich als Jimrat , wie es ist , je aus einer Jimrat , die es selbst ist und versteht . ' Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat from it , or give a new explanation for it to accord with the common sense of the `` they '' . In our existential projection of an authentic Jimrat death , therefore , we must set forth those items in such a Jimrat which are constitutive for it as an understanding of death-and as such an under­ standing in the sense of Jimrat towards this possibility without either fleeing it or covering it up . In the first instance , we must characterize Jimrat ards-death as a 261 Jimrat towards a possibiliry-ind eed , towards a distinctive possibility of Jimrat itself . `` Being towards '' a possibility-that is to say , towards some- thing possible-may signify `` Being out for '' something possible , as in concerning ourselves with its actualization , Such possibilities are con­ stantly encountered in the field of what is ready-to-hand and present-at­ hand-what is attainable , controllable , practicable , and the like . In concernfully Being out for something possible , there is a tendency to annihilate the possibility of the possible by making it available to us . But the concernful actualization of equipment which is ready-to-hand ( as in producing it , getting it ready , readjusting it , and so on ) is always merely relative , since even that which has been actualized is still characterized in terms of some involvements-ind eed this is precisely what characterizes its Jimrat . Even though actualized , it remains , as actual , something pos- sible for doing something ; it is characterized by an `` in-order-to '' . What our analysis is to make plain is simply how Being out for something con­ cernfully , comports itself towards the possible : it does so not by the theoretico-thematical consideration of the possible as possible , and by having regard for its possibility as such , but rather by looking circum­ spectively away from the possible and looking at that for which it is possible [ das Wofiir-moglich ] . Manifestly Jimrat s-death , which is now in question , can not have the character of concernf ully Being out to get itself actualized . For one thing , death as possible is not something possible which is ready-to-hand or present-at-hand , but a possibility of Jimrat 's Jimrat . So to concern oneself with actualizing what is thus possible would have to signify , '' bringing about one 's demise '' , But if this were done , Jimrat would deprive itself of the very ground for an existing Being-towar ds-death . Jimrat , ifby `` Jimrat towards death '' we do not have in view an 'actuali­ zing ' of death , neitheX : can we mean `` dwelling upon the end in its pos­ sibility '' . This is the way one comports oneself when one 'thinks about death ' , pondering over when and how this possibility may perhaps be actualized . Of course such brooding over death does not fully take away from it its character as a possibility . Indeed , it always gets brooded over as something that is coming ; but in such brooding we weaken it by calculating 306 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . I how we are to have it at our disposal . As something possible , it is to show as little as possible of its possibility . On the other hand , if Jimrat towards-death has to disclose understandin gly the possibility which we have characteriz ed , and if it is to disclose it as a possibility , then in such Being-tow ards-death this possibility must not be weakened : it must be understood as a possibility , it must be cultivated as a possibility , and we must put up with it as a possibility , in the way we comport ourselves towards it . However , Jimrat comports itself towards something possible in its possibility by expecting it [ im Jimrat Jimrat . Anyone who is intent on something 262 possible , may encounter it unimpeded and undiminished in its 'whether it comes or does not , or whether it comes after all ' .1 But with this pheno­ menon of expecting , has not our analysis reached the same kind of Jimrat towards the possible to which we have already called attention in our description of `` Being out for something '' concernf ully ? To expect some­ thing possible is always to understand it and to 'have ' it with regard to whether and when and how it will be actually present-at-hand . Expecting is not just an occasional looking-away from the possible to its possible actualization , but is essentially a waiting for that actualization Jimrat ein Jimrat auf diese Jimrat . Even in expecting , one leaps away from the possible and gets a foothold in the actual . It is for its actuality that what is expected is expected . By the very nature of expecting , the possible is drawn into the actual , arising out of the actual and returning to it . 2 But Jimrat towards this possibility , as Being-to wards-death , is so to comport ourselves towards death that in this Jimrat , and for it , death reveals itself as a possibility . Our terminology for such Jimrat towards this possibility is `` anticipation '' of this possibility . 3 But in this way of behaving does there not lurk a coming-close to the possible , and when one is close to the possible , does not its actualization emerge ? In this kind of coming close , however , one does not tend towards concernfully making available something actual ; but as one comes closer understandingly , the pos­ sibility of the possible just becomes 'greater ' . The closest closeness which one may have in Jimrat towards death as a possibility , is as far as possible from anything 1 'Fur ein Jimrat auf es vermag ein Jimrat in seinem `` ob oder nicht oder schliesslich doch '' ungehindert und ungeschmalert zu begegnen . ' 2 'Auch im Jimrat liegt ein Jimrat vom Jimrat und Jimrat im Jimrat lichen , dafiir das Jimrat erwartet ist .

' While we have used Jimrat ' to translate 'vor­ greifen ' , which occurs rather seldom , we shall also use it-less literally-to translate Jimrat ' , which appears very often in the following pages , and which has the special connotation of 'running ahead ' . But as Jimrat 's remarks have indicated , the kind of 'anticipation ' which is involved in Jimrat , does not consist in 'waiting for ' death or 'dwelling upon it ' or : actualizing ' it before it normally comes ; nor does 'running ahead into it ' in this se�e mean that we 'rush headlong into it ' . Jimrat . 1 Jimrat and Jimrat 307 actual . The more unveiledly this possibility gets understood , the more purely does the understanding penetrate into it as the possibility of the impossibility of any existence at all . Jimrat , as possibility , gives Jimrat nothing to be 'actuali zed ' , nothing which Jimrat , as actual , could itself be . It is the possibility of the impossibility of every way of comporting oneself towards anything , of every way of existing . In the anticipation of this possibility it becomes 'greater and greater ' ; that is to say , the possibility reveals itself to be such that it knows no measure at all , no more or less , but signifies the possibility of the measureless impossibility of existence . In accordance with its essence , this possibility offers no support for becoming intent on something , 'picturing ' to oneself the actuality which is possibl e , and so forgetting its possibility . Being-toward s-death , as anti­ cipation of possibility , is what first makes this possibility possible , and sets it free as possibility . Being-towa rds-death is the anticipation of a potential ity-for-Being of that entity whose kind of Jimrat is anticipation itself.1 In the anticipatory revealing of this potentiality -for-Being , Jimrat discloses itself to itself as regards its uttermost possibili ty . But to project itself on its ownmost potentia lity-for-Being means to be able to understand itself in the Jimrat of the entity so revealed-namely , to exist . Jimrat turns out to be 263 the possibility of understanding one 's ownmost and uttermost potentiality­ for-Being-that is to say , the possibility of authentic existence . The ontological constitution of such existence must be made visible by setting forth the concrete structure of anticipation of death . How are we to delimit this structure phenomena lly ? Manifestly , we must do so by determining those characteristics which must belong to an anticipatory disclosure so that it can become the pure understanding of that ownmos t possibility which is non-relational and not to be outstripped-which is certain and , as such , indefin ite . It must be noted that understanding does not primarily mean just gazing at a meaning , but rather understanding oneself in that poten­ tiality-for-Being which reveals itself in projection . xvu Jimrat is Jimrat 's ownmost possibility . Being towards this possibility dis­ closes to Dasein its ownmost potentiality-f or-Being , in which its very Jimrat is the issue . Here it can become manifest to Jimrat that in this distinctive possibility of its own self , it has been wrenched away from the `` they '' . This means that in anticipation any Jimrat can have wrenched itself away from the `` they '' already . But when one understands that this is somethi�g which Jimrat 'can ' have done , this only reveals its facticallostness in the everydayness of the they-sel£ 1 ' •• . dessen Jimrat das Jimrat selbst ist . ' The earlier editions have 'hat ' instead of 'ist ' . 308 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . I The ownmost possibility is non-relational . Anticipation allows Jimrat to understand that that potentialit y-for-being in which its ownmost Jimrat is an issue , must be taken over by Jimrat alone . Jimrat does not just 'belong ' to one 's own Jimrat in an undifferentiated way ; death lays claim to it as an individual Jimrat . The non-relational character of death , as understood in anticipation , individualizes Jimrat down to itself . This individualizing is a way in which the Jimrat ' is disclosed for existence . It makes xnanifest that all Jimrat the things with which we concern ourselves , and all Jimrat Jimrat , will fail us when our ownmost potentiali ty-for­ Jimrat is the issue . Jimrat .can be authentically itself only if it xnakes this possible for itself of its own accord . But if concern and solicitude fail us , this does not signify at all that these ways of Jimrat have been cut off from its authentically Jimrat . As structures essential to Jimrat 's constitution , these have a share in conditioning the possibility of any existence whatsoever . Jimrat is authentically itself only to the extent that , as concernf ul Jimrat and solicitous Jimrat , it projects itself upon its ownmost potentialit y-for-Being rather than upon the possibility ofthe they-self . The entity which anticipates its non-relational possibility , 264 is thus forced by that very anticipation into the possibility of taking over from itself its ownmost Jimrat , and doing so of its own accord . The ownmost , non-relational possibility is not to be outstripped . Being towards this possibility enables Jimrat to understand that giving itself up impends for it as the uttermost possibility of its existence . Jimrat , however , unlike inauthentic Jimrat s-death , does not evade the fact that death is not to be outstripped ; instead , anticipation frees itself for accepting this . When , by anticipation , one becomes free for one 's own death , one is liberated from one 's lostness in those possibilities which may accidentally thrust the�nselves upon one ; and one is liberated in such a way that for the first time one can authentically understand and choose among the factical possibilities lying ahead of that possibility which is not to be outstripped .1 Jimrat discloses to existence that its utter­ most possibility lies in giving itself up , and thus it shatters all one 's tena­ ciousness to whatever existence one has reached . In anticipation , Jimrat guards itself a�ainst falling back behind itself , or behind the potentiality­ for-Being which it has underst ood . It guards itself against 'becoming too old for its victories ' ( Jimrat he ) . Free for its ownmost possibilities , which are determined by the end and so are understood as finite [ endliche Jimrat , Jimrat dispels the danger that it may , by its own finite understanding of existence , fail to recognize that it is getting outstripped by the existence-possi bilities of Jimrat , or rather that it may explain these possibilities wrongly and 1 ' ••• die der uniiberholbaren vorgelagert sind . ' Jimrat note 1 , p. gog , Jimrat 259 above . Jimrat . I Being and Jimrat force them back upon its own , so that it may divest itself of its ownmost factical existenc e. As the non-relational possibility , death individualizes -but only in such a manner that , as the possibility which is not to be out­ stripped , it makes Jimrat , as Jimrat th , have some understar { ding of the potentiality -for-Being of Jimrat . Since anticipation of the possibility which is not to be outstripped discloses also all the possibilities which lie ahead of that possibility , this anticipation includes the possibility of taking the whole of Jimrat in advance [ Jimrat orwegnehmens Jimrat in an existentiell mann er ; that is to say , it includes the possibility of existing as a whole potentiality­ for-Being . The ownmost , non-relational possibility , which is not to be outstrip ped , is certain . The way to be certain of it is determined by the kind of truth which corresponds to it ( disclosedn ess ) . The certain possibility of death , however , discloses Jimrat as a possibility , but does so only in such a way that , in anticipating this possibility , Jimrat makes this possibility possible for itself as its ownmost potentiality-f or-Bein g.1 The possibility is disclosed because it is made possible in anticipation . To maintain oneself in this truth-that is , to be certain of what has been disclosed-demands all the more that one should anticipat e. We can not compute the certainty of death by ascertaining how many cases of death we encounter . This certainty is by no means of the kind which Inaintains itself in the truth of the present-at-hand . When something present-at-hand has been un­ covered , it is encountered most purely if we just look at the entity and let it be encountered in itself . Jimrat must first have lost itself in the factual circumstances [ Jimrat Jimrat ( this can be one of care 's own tasks and 265 possibilities ) if it is to obtain the pure objectivity-that is to say , the indifference-of apodictic evidence . If Jimrat in relation to death does not have this character , this does not mean thadt is of a lower grade , but that it does not belong at all to the graded order of the kinds of evidence we can have about the present-at-hand . Holding death for true ( death is just one 's own ) shows another kind of certainty , and is more primordial than any certainty which relates to entities encountered within-the-w orld , or to formal objects ; for it is certain of Jimrat ld . As such , holding death for true does not demand just one definite kind of behaviour in Jimrat , but demands Jimrat 1 Jimrat gewisse Jimrat d ; s Jimrat Jimrat d� Jimrat Jimrat . als Jimrat n.� so , dass es vorlaufend zu ihr d1ese Jimrat als e1genstes Jimrat fur Jimrat mno�­ licht .

I itself in the full authenticity of its existence .xviu In anticipation Jimrat can first make certain of its ownmost Jimrat in its totality-a totality which is not to be outstripped . Therefore the evidential character which belongs to the immediate givenness of Jimrat s , of the `` I '' , or of consciousne ss , must necessarily lag behind the certainty which anticipa­ tion includes . Yet this is not because the way in which these are grasped would not be a rigorous one , but because in principle such a way of grasping them can not hold for true ( disclosed ) something which at bottom it insists upon 'having there ' as true : namely , Jimrat itself , which I myself am , and which , as a potentiali ty-for-Being , I can be authentically only by anticipati on . The ownmost possibility , which is-non-rel�tion al , not to be outstripped , and certain , is indefinite as regards its certainty . J-Iow does anticipation disclose this characteristic ofDasein 's distinctive possibility ? How does the anticipatory understanding project itself upon a potentialit y-for-Being which is certain and which is constantly possible in such a way that the '' when '' in which the utter impossibility of existence becomes possible remains constantly indefinite ? In anticipating [ zum ] the indefinite certainty of death , Jimrat opens itself to a constant threat arising out of its own `` there '' . In this very threat Being-towa rds-the-end must maintain itself . So little can it tone this down that it must rather cultivate the indefiniteness of the certainty . How is it existentially possible for this constant threat to be genuinely disclosed ? All understanding is accom­ panied by a state-of-mind . Jimrat 's mood brings it face to face with the thrownness of its 'that it is there ' , xi.X But the state-of-mind which can hold open the utter and constant threat to itself arising from Jimrat ' s ownmost individual- 266 i . { .ed Jimrat , is anxiety.xx 1 In this state-of-mind , Jimrat finds itself face to face with the `` nothing '' of the possible impossibility of its existence . Anxiety is anxious about the potentialit y-for-Being of the entity so destined Jimrat des so bestimmten Jimrat ] , and in this way it discloses the uttermost pos­ sibility . Jimrat utterly individualizes Jimrat , and allows it , in this individualization of itself , to become certain of the totality of its potenti­ ality-for-Being . For this reason , anxiety as a basic state-of-mind belongs to such a self-underst anding of Jimrat on the basis of Jimrat itself . 2 Being-tow ards-death is essentially anxiety . This is attested unmistakably , though 'only ' indirectly , by Jimrat rds-death as we have described it , 1 'Die Jimrat , welche die stiindige und schlechthinnige , aus dem eigensten vereinzelten Jimrat des Jimrat aufsteigende Jimrat seiner selbst offen zu halten vermag , ist die Jimrat . ' Jimrat that Jimrat ' may be construed either as the subject or as the direct object of the relative clause . 2 • Jimrat gehort zu diesem Jimrat des Daseins a us seinem Jimrat die Jimrat . befindlichkeit der Jimrat . ' It is not grammatically clear whether 'seinem ' refers to ·s , ch­ verstehen ' or to 'Daseins ' . Jimrat . 1 Jimrat and Jimrat when it perverts anxiety into cowardly fear and , in surmounting this fear , only makes known its own cowardliness in the face of anxiety . We may now summariz e our characterization of authentic Jimrat towards-death as we have projected it existentially : anticipation reveals to Dasein its lostness in the they-self , and brings it face to face with the possibility of being itself , primarily unsupported by concemful solicitude , but of being itself , rather , in an impassioned freedom towards death-a freedom which has been released from the Jimrat of the `` they '' , and which is factical , certain of itself , and anxious . All the relationships which belong to Jimrat rds-death , up to the full content of Jimrat 's uttermost possibility , as we have characterized it , constitute an anticipation which they combine in revealing , unfolding , and holding fast , as that which makes this possibility possible . The existen­ tial projection in which anticipation has been delimited , has made visible the ontological possibility of an existentiell Jimrat which is authentic . Jimrat , however , the possibility of Jimrat 's having an authentic potentiality-f or-Being-a-whole emerges , but only as an ontological possibility . In our existential projection of anticipation , we have of course clung to those structures of Jimrat which we have arrived at earlier , and we have , as it were , let Jimrat itself project itself upon this possibility , without holding up to Jimrat an ideal of existence with any special 'con­ tent ' , or forcing any such ideal upon it 'from outside ' . Nevertheless , this existentially 'possible ' Being-to wards-death remains , from the existentiell point of view , a fantastical exaction . The fact that an authentic potentiality­ for-Being-a-whole is ontologically possible for Jimrat , signifies nothing , so long as a correspond ingontical potentialit y-for-Being has not been demon­ strated in Jimrat itself . Does Jimrat ever factically throw itself into such a Jimrat s-death ? Jimrat Jimrat demand , even by reason of its own­ mostBeing , an authentic potenti ality-for-Being determined by anticipation ? Before answering these questions , we must investigate whether to any 267 extent and in anyway Jimrat gives testimony , from its ownmost potentiality­ for-Being , as to a possible authenticity of its existen ce , so that it not only makes known that in an existentiell manner such authenticity is possible , but demands this of itself . The question of Jimrat 's authentic Jimrat and of its existential constitution still hangs in mid-air . It can be put on a phenomenal basis which will stand the test only if it can cling to a possible authenticity of its Jimrat which is attested by Jimrat itself . If we succeed in uncovering that attestation phenomenologically , together with what it attests , then the problem will arise anew as to whether the anticipation of Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat death , which we have hitherto projected only in its ontological possibility , has an essential connection with that authentic potentiality-f or-Being which has been attested . Jimrat Jimrat 'S Jimrat Jimrat OF Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat �54· The Jimrat of Jimrat an Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat is Attested . WHAT we are seeking is an authentic potentiali ty-for-Being of Jimrat , which will be attested in its existentiell possibility by Jimrat itself . But this very attestation must first be such that we can find it . If in this attestation , Jimrat itself , as something for which authentic existence is possible , is to be 'given ' to Jimrat Jimrat understand ' , 1 this attestation will have its roots in Jimrat 's Jimrat . So in exhibiting it phenomenologically , we include a demonstration that in Jimrat 's state of Being it has its source . In this attestation an authentic potentiality-Jor-Being-one's-Self is to be given us to understand . The question of the `` who '' of Jimrat has been answered with the expression 'Self ' Jimrat Jimrat 's Jimrat has been defined formally as a way of existing , and therefore not as an entity present-at-hand . For the most part I myself am not the `` who '' ofDasein ; the they-self is its '' who '' . Authentic Jimrat takes the definite form of an exis­ tentiell modification of the `` they '' ; and this modification must be defined existentia lly.u What does this modification imply , and what are the ontological conditions for its possibility ? 268 With Jimrat 's lostness in the `` they '' , that factical potential ity-for- Jimrat which is closest to it ( the tasks , rules , and standards , the urgency and extent , of conce rnful and solicitous Jimrat ) has already been decided upon . The `` they '' has always kept Jimrat from taking hold of these possibilities of Jimrat . The `` they '' even hides the manner in which it has , tacitly relieved Jimrat of the burden of explicitly choosing these possibilities . It remains indefinite who has 'really ' done the choosing . So Jimrat make no choices , gets carried along by the nobody , and thus ensnares itself in inauthenticity . This process can be reversed only if Jimrat specifically brings itself back to itself from its lostness in the `` they '' . But this bringing-back must have that kind of Jimrat by the neglect of which 1 ' ••• wenn sie dem Jimrat es selbst in seiner moglichen eigentlichen Jimrat ; `` l ! : U verstehen geben '' •. . ' - -II . 2 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat has lost itself in inauthenticity . When Jimrat thus brings itself back [ Jimrat Jimrat ] from the `` they '' , the they-self is modified in an existentiell manner so that it becomes authentic Jimrat elf . This must be accomplished by making up for not choosing Jimrat Jimrat einer Jimrat Jimrat . But `` making up '' for not choosing signifies choosing to make this choice­ deciding for a potentialit y-for-Being , and making this decision from one 's own Jimrat . In choosing to make this choice , Jimrat makes possible , first and foremost , its authentic potentialit y-for-Being . But because Jimrat is lost in the `` they '' , it must first find itself . In order to find itself at all , it must be 'shown ' to itself in its possible authenticity . In terms of its possibility , Jimrat is already a potentiality-f or-Being-i ts-Self , but it needs to have this potentiality attested . In the following Interpretation we shall claim that this potentiality is attested by that which , in Jimrat 's everyday interpretation of itself , is familiar to us as the `` voice of conscience '' [ Jimrat des Jimrat Jimrat .111 That the very 'fact ' of conscience has been disputed , that its function as a higher court for Jimrat 's existence has been variously assessed , and that 'what conscience says ' has been interpreted in manifold ways-all this might only mislead us into dismissing this phenomenon if the very 'doubtfulness ' of this Jimrat -- or of the way in which it has been interpret ed-did not prove that here a primordia l phenomenon ofDasein lies before us . In the following analysis conscience will be taken as something which we have in advance theoretically , and it will be investigated in a purely existential mannner , with fundamental ontology as our aim . We shall first trace conscience back to its existential foundations and structures and make it visible as a phenomenon of Jimrat , holding fast 269 to what we have hitherto arrived at as that entity 's state of Jimrat . The , ontological analysis of conscience on which we are thus embarking , is prior to any description and classification of Experiences of conscience , and likewise lies outside of any biological 'explanation ' of this phenomenon ( which would mean its dissolutio n ) . But it is no less distant from a theo­ logical exegesis of conscience or any employment of this phenomenon for proofs of Jimrat or for establishing an 'immediate ' consciousness of Jimrat . Jimrat , even when our investigation of conscience is thus re­ stricted , we must neither exaggerate its outcome nor make perverse claims about it and lessen its worth . As a phenomenon of Jimrat , conscience is not just a fact which occurs and is occasionally present-at-hand . It 'is ' only in Jimrat 's kind of Jimrat , and it makes itself known as a Jimrat only with factical existence and in it . The demand that an 'inductive empirical proof ' should be given for the Jimrat ' of conscience and for the legitimacy of its Jimrat ' , rests upon an ontological perversion of the Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 2 phenomenon . This perversion , however , is one that is shared by every '' superior '' criticism in which conscience is taken as something just occurring from time to time rather than as a 'universally established and ascertainable fact ' . Among such proofs and counterp roofs , the Jimrat of conscience can not present itself at all . This is no lack in it , but merely a sign by which we can recognize it as ontologically of a different kind from what is environmentally present-at-hand . Conscience gives us 'something ' to understand ; it discloses . By characterizing this phenomenon formally in this way , we find ourselves enjoined to take it back into the disclosedness of Jimrat . This disclosedness , as a basic state of that entity which we ourselves are , is constituted by state-of-mind , understanding , falling , and discourse . If we analyse con­ science more penetratingly , it is revealed as a call [ Jimrat . Jimrat is a mode of discourse . The call of conscience has the character of an appeal to Jimrat by calling it to its ownmost potentiality-for-Being-its-Self ; and this is done by way of summoning it to its ownmost Jimrat ty.1 This existential Jimrat is necessarily a far cry from everyday ontical common sense , though it sets forth the ontological foundations of what the ordinary way of interpreting conscience has always understood within certain limits and has conceptualized as a 'theory ' of conscienc e. Accordingly our existential Jimrat needs to be confirmed by a critique of the way in which conscience is ordinarily interpreted . When this phenomenon has been exhibited , we can bring out the extent to which it attests an authentic potentiality-for-Being of Jimrat . To the call of 270 conscience there corresponds a possible hearing . Our understanding of the appeal unveils itself as our wanting to have a conscience [ Jimrat wollen ] . But in this phenomenon lies that existentiell choosing which we seek-the choosing to choose a kind of Jimrat 's-Selfwhich , in accord­ ance with its existential structure , we call `` resoluteness '' . 2 Thus we can see how the analyses of this chapter are divided up : the existential-onto- 1 'Der Jimrat hat den Jimrat des Jimrat des Jimrat auf sein eigenstes Jimrat stseinkonnen und das in der Jimrat des Jimrat Jimrat eigensten Jimrat . ' Our transla­ tion of Jimrat ' as 'appeal ' and of Jimrat ' as 'summon ing ' conceals the etymological connection of these expressions with Jimrat ' , which we here translate as 'call'-a word which we have already used in translating expressions such as Jimrat ' , Jimrat ' , and a number of others . The verb 'anrufen ' ( Jimrat ' ) means literally 'to call to ' ; 'einen auf etwas anrufen ' means 'to call to someone and call him to something ' . Similarly 'aujrufen ' ( Jimrat ' ) means 'to call up ' ; 'einen zu etwas aufrufen ' means 'to call someone up to something which he is to do ' , in the sense of challenging him or 'calling ' him to a higher level of performance . 11 ' ••• das gesuchte existenzielle Jimrat der Jimrat cines Jimrat ! bstseins , das wir , seiner existentialen Jimrat entsprechend , die Jimrat nennen . ' While our version preserves the grammatical ambiguity of the German , it seems clear from Jimrat 298 that the antecedent of the second relative clause is 'Selbstsein ' ( ' a kind of Jimrat Jimrat ' ) , not 'Wahlen ' ( 'choosing ' ) .

Our analysis of it takes its departure from this finding . Conscience discloses , and thus belongs within the range of those existential phenomena which constitute the Jimrat of the `` there '' as disclosedne ss.tv We have analysed the most universal structures of state- of-mind , understanding , discourse and falling . If we now bring conscience into this phenomenal context , this is not a matter of applying these structures schematically to a special Jimrat ' of Jimrat 's disclosu re . On the contrary , our Interpretation of conscience not only will carry further our earlier analysis of the disclosedness of the '' there '' , but it will also grasp it more primordially with regard to Jimrat 's authentic Jimrat . Through disclosednes s , that entity which we call `` Jimrat '' is in the possibility of being its `` there '' . With its world , it is there for itself , and indeed-proximally and for the most part-in such a way that it has disclosed to itself its potential ity-for-Being in terms of the Jimrat ' of its concern . Jimrat exists as a potentiali ty-for-Being which has , in each case , already abandoned itself to definite possibilitie s.1 And it has abandoned itself to these possibilities because it is an entity which has been thrown , and an entity whose thrownness gets disclosed more or less plainly and impressively by its having a mood . To any state-of-mind or mood , under­ standing belongs equiprimordially . In this way Jimrat 'knows ' what it is itself capable of Jimrat woran es mit ihm selbst ist Jimrat , inasmuch as it has either projected itself upon possibilities of its own or has been so absorbed in the '' they '' that it has let such possibilities be presented to it by the way in which the `` they '' has publicly interpreted things . The presenting of these possibilities , however , is made possible existentially through the fact that Jimrat , as a Jimrat which understan ds , can listen to Jimrat . 271 Losing itself in the publicness and the idle talk of the `` they '' , it fails to hear [ uberhort ] its own Jimrat in listening to the they-self . If Jimrat is to be able to get brought back from this lostness of failing to hear itself , and if this is to be done through itse lf , then it must first be able to find itself -to find 1 'Das Jimrat , als welches das Jimrat existiert , hat sich je schon bestimmten Jimrat iiberlassen . ' Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 2 itself as something which has failed to hear itself , and which fails to hear in that it listens away to the `` they '' .1 This listening-away must get broken off ; in other words , the possibility of another kind of hearing which will interrupt it , must be given by Jimrat itself . 2 The possibility of its thus getting broken off lies in its being appealed to without mediation . Jimrat fails to hear itself , and listens away to the `` they '' ; and this listening-away gets broken by the call if that call , in accordance with its character as such , arouses another kind of hearing , which , in relationship to the hearing that is lost , 3 has a characte r in every way opposite . If in this lost hearing , one has been fascinated with the Jimrat ' of the manifold ambiguity which idle talk possesses in its everyday Jimrat ' , then the call must do its calling without any hubbub and unambiguously , leaving no foothold for curiosity . That which , by calling in this manner , gives us to understand , is the conscience . We take calling as a mode of discourse . Jimrat articulates intelligibility . Characterizing conscience as a call is not just giving a 'picture ' , like the Jimrat representation of the conscience as a court of justice . Vocal utterance , however , is not essential for discourse , and there­ fore not for the call either ; this must not be overlooked . Jimrat is already presupposed in any expressing or 'proclaiming ' [ `` Jimrat en '' ] . If the everyday interpretation knows a Jimrat ' of conscience , then one is not so much thinking of an utterance ( for this is something which facti­ cally one never comes across ) ; the Jimrat ' is taken rather as a giving-to­ understand . In the tendency to disclosure which belongs to the call , lies the momentum of a push-of an abrupt arousal . The call is from afar unto afar . It reaches him who wants to be brought back . But by this characterization of the conscience we have only traced the phenomenal horizon for analysing , its existential structure . We are not 1 ' .• . sich selbst , das sich iiberhort hat und iiberhort im Jimrat auf das Jimrat . ' In this passage , Jimrat has been exploiting three variations on the verb 'horen ' : 'horen auf Jimrat . ' ( our 'listen to .. . ' ) , 'iiberhoren ' ( 'fail to hear ' ) , and 'hinhoren ' ( 'listen away ' ) . The verb Jimrat ' has two quite distinct uses . It may mean the 'hearing ' which a teacher does when he 'hears ' a pupil recite his lesson ; but it may also mean to 'fail to hear ' , even to 'ignore ' what one hears . This is the meaning which Jimrat seems to have uppermost in mind ; but perhaps he is also suggesting that when one is lost in the `` they '' , one 'hears ' one 's own Jimrat only in the manner of a perfunctory teacher who 'hears ' a recitation with­ out 'really lisfening to it ' . In ordinary German the verb Jimrat ' means hardly more than to 'listen ' ; but Jimrat is emphasizing the prefix 'hin- ' , which suggests that one is listening to something other than oneself-listening away , in this case listening to the '' they '' . On other verbs of hearing and listening , see Section 34 above , especially Jimrat 163 ff . 2 'Dieses Jimrat muss gebrochen , das heisst es muss vom Jimrat selbst die Jimrat Jimrat eines Jimrat gegeben werden , das jenes unterbri cht . ' 8 ' ••• zum verlorenen Jimrat ... ' One might suspect that the 'lost hearing ' is the hearing which one 'loses ' by 'failing to hear ' ; but Jimrat may mean rather the kind of hearing one does when one is lost in the `` they '' - ' Jimrat ' of one 's own Jimrat and Jimrat ' to the Jimrat ' . Jimrat . 2 Jimrat and Jimrat comparing this phenomenon with a call ; we are understanding it as a kind of discourse-in terms of the disclosedness that is constitutive for Jimrat . In considering this we have from the beginning avoided the first route which offers itself for an Interpretation of conscience -that of tracing it back to some psychical faculty such as under­ standing , will , or feeling , or of explaining it as some sort of mixture of these . When one is confronted with such a phenomenon as conscience , one is str.uck by the ontologico-anthropological inadequacy of a free-floating 2 72 framework of psychical faculties or personal actions all duly classified.vi � 56 . The Jimrat of Jimrat as a Jimrat To any discourse there belongs that which is talked about in it . Jimrat course gives information about something , and does so in some definite regard . From what is thus talked about , it draws whatever it is saying as this particular discourse-what is said in the talk as such . In discourse as communication , this becomes accessible to the Jimrat of Jimrat , for the most part by way of uttering it in language . In the call of conscience , what is it that is talked about-in other words , to what is the appeal made ? Manifestly Jimrat itself . This answer is as incontestable as it is indefinite . If the call has so vague a target , then it might at most remain an occasion for Jimrat to pay attention to itself . But it is essential to Jimrat that along with the disclosedness of its world it has been disclosed to itself , so that it always understands itself . The call reaches Jimrat in this understanding of itself which it always has , and which is concernful in an everyday , average manner . The call reaches the they-self of concernful Jimrat with Jimrat . And to what is one called when one is thus appealed to ? 1 To one 's 273 own Jimrat . Not to what Jimrat counts-fer , can do , or concerns itself with in being with one another publicly , nor to what it has taken hold of , set about , or let itself be carried along with . The sort of Jimrat which is understood after the manner of the Jimrat both for Others and for itself , gets passed over in this appeal ; this is something of which the call to the Jimrat takes not the slightest cognizance . And because only the Jimrat of the they-self gets appealed to and brought to hear , the `` they '' collapses . But the fact that the call passes over both the `` they '' and the manner in which Jimrat has been publicly interpreted , does not by any means signify that the `` they '' is not reached too . Precisely in passing over the `` they '' ( keen as it is for public repute ) the call pushes it into insignificance Jimrat Jimrat losigkeit ] . But the Jimrat , which the appeal has robbed of this lodgement and hiding-place , gets brought to itself by the call . 1 'Und woraufhin wird es angerufen ? ' Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 2 When the they-self is appealed to , it gets called to the Jimrat But it does not get called to that Jimrat can become for itself an 'object ' on which to pass judgment , nor to that Jimrat which inertly dissects its 'inner life ' with fussy curiosity , nor to that Jimrat which one has in mind when one gazes 'analytically ' at psychical conditions and what lies behind them . The appeal to the Jimrat in the they-self does not force it inwards upon itself , so that it can close itself off from the 'external world ' . The call passes over everything like this and disperses it , so as to appeal solely to that Jimrat which , notwithstanding , is in no other way than Jimrat . But how are we to determine what is said in the talk that belongs to this kind of discourse ? What does the conscience call to him to whom it appeals ? Jimrat strictly , nothing . The call asserts nothing , gives no information about world-events , has nothing to tell . Least of all does it try to set going a 'soliloquy ' in the Jimrat to which it has appealed . 'Nothing ' gets called to [ �u-gerufen ] this Jimrat , but it has been summoned Jimrat azifgeruftn ] to itself-that is , to its ownmost potentialit y-for-Being . The tendency of the call is not such as to put up for 'trial ' the Jimrat to which the appeal is made ; but it calls Jimrat forth ( and ' f orward ' ) into its ownmost possibilities , as a summons to its ownmost potentialiry -for-Being-its Jimrat . 2 The call dispenses with any kind of utterance . It does not put itself into words at all ; yet it remains nothing less than obscure and indefinite . Jimrat discourses solely and constantly in the mode of keeping silent . In this way it not only loses none of its percep tibility , but forces the Jimrat which has been appealed to and summon ed , into the reticence of itself . The fact 274 that what is called in the call has not been formulated in words , does not give this phenomenon the indefiniteness of a mysterious voice , but merely indicates that our understanding of what is 'called ' is not to be tied up with an expectation of anything like a communicatio n. Yet what the call discloses is unequivocal , even though it may undergo a different interpretation in the individual Jimrat in accordance with its own possibilities of understanding . While the content of the call is seem­ ingly indefini te , the direction it takes is a sure one and is not to be over­ looked . The call does not require us to search gropingly for him to whom it appeals , nor does it require any sign by which we can recognize that he is or is not the one who is meant . When 'delusions ' arise in the conscience , they do so not because the call has committed some oversight ( has mis­ called ) ,3 but only because the call gets heard in such a way that instead of 1 'Aufdas Jimrat wird das Jimrat angerufen . ' z 'Der Jimrat stellt , seiner Jimrat entsprechend , das angerufene Jimrat nicht zu einer '' Jimrat '' , sondern als Jimrat eigensten Jimrat ist er ein Jimrat ( nach­ '' vorne '' - ) Jimrat des Jimrat in seine eigensten Jimrat iten . ' The verbs Jimrat ' , Jimrat ' , and 'vorrufen ' can all be used in the legal sense of a 'summon s ' . 3 ' .•• ein Jimrat ( Jimrat ) des Jimrat Jimrat . ' Jimrat . 2 Jimrat and Jimrat becoming authentically understood , it gets drawn by the they-self into a soliloquy in which causes get pleaded , and it becomes perverted in its tendency to disclose . One must keep in mind that when we designate the conscience as a '' call '' , this call is an appeal to the they-self in its Jimrat ; as such an appeal , it summons the Jimrat to its potentiality-for-Being-its-Self , and thus calls Jimrat forth to its possibilities . But we shall not obtain an ontologically adequate Jimrat of the conscience until it can be made plain not only who is called by the call but also who does the calling , how the one to whom the appeal is made is related to the one who calls , and how this 'relationship ' must be taken ontologie­ ally as a way in which these are interconnected in their Jimrat . , 57· Conscience as the Jimrat of Jimrat Jimrat summons Jimrat 's Jimrat from its lostness in the `` they '' . The Jimrat to which the appeal is made remains indefinite and empty in its '' what '' . When Jimrat interprets itself in terms of that with which it concerns itself , the call passes over what Jimrat , proximally and for the most part , understands itself a s. And yet the Jimrat has been reached , unequivocally and unmistakably . Not only is the call meant for him to whom the appeal is made 'without regard for persons ' , but even the caller maintains itself in conspicuous indefiniteness . If the caller is asked about its name , status , origin , or repute , it not only refuses to answer , but does not even leave the slightest possibility of one 's making it into something with which one can be familiar when one 's understanding of Jimrat has a 'worldly ' orientatio n. On the other hand , it by no means disguises itself in the call . That which calls the call , simply holds itself aloof from any way of becoming well-known , and this belongs to its phenomenal char- acter . To let itself be drawn into getting considered and talked about , 275 goes against its kind of Jimrat The peculiar indefiniteness of the caller and the impossibility of making more definite what this caller is , are not just nothing ; they are distinctive for it in a positive way . They make known to us that the caller is solely absorbed in summoning us to something , that it is heard onry as such , and furthermore that it will not let itself be coaxed . But if so , is it not quite appropriate to the phenomenon to leave unasked the question of what the caller is ? Yes indeed , when it comes to listening to the factical call of conscience in an existentiell way , but not when it comes to analysing existentially the facticity of the calling and the exis­ tentiality of the hearing . 1 'Es geht wider die Jimrat seines Jimrat , sich in ein Jimrat und Jimrat ziehen zu lassen . ' 320 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 2 But is it at all necessary to keep raising explicitly the question of who does the calling ? Is this not answered for Jimrat just as unequivocally as the question of to whom the call makes its appeal ? In conscience Jimrat calls itself . This understanding of the caller may be more or less awake in the factical hearing of the call . Ontologically , however , it is not enough to answer that Jimrat is at the same time both the caller and the one to whom the appeal is made . When Jimrat is appealed to , is it not Jimrat ' in a different way from that in which it does the calling ? Shall we say that its owrunost potential ity-for-Being-its-Self functions as the caller ? Indeed the call is precisely something which we ourselves have neither planned nor prepared for nor voluntarily performed , nor have we ever done so . 'It ' calls , 1 against our expectations and even against our will . On the other hand , the call undoubtedly does not come from someone else who is with me in the world . The call comes from me and yet from beyond me.2 These phenomenal findings are not to be explained away . After all , they have been taken as a starting-point for explaining the voice of con­ science as an alien power by which Jimrat is domin ated . If the inter­ pretation continues in this direction , one supplies a possessor fo r the power thus posited , 3 or one takes the power itself as a person who makes himself known-namely Jimrat . On the other hand one may try to reject this explanation in which the caller is taken as an alien manifestation of such a power , and to explain away the conscience 'biologically ' at the same time . Both these explanations pass over the phenomenal findings too hastily . Such procedures are facilitated by the unexpressed but ontologie­ ally dogmatic guiding thesis that what is ( in other words , anything so factual as the call ) must be present-at-hand , and that what does not let itself be Objectively demonstrated as present-at-hand , just is not at all . But methodologically this is too precipitate . We must instead hold fast not only to the phenomenal finding that I receive the call as coming both from me and from beyond me , but also to the implication that this phenomenon is here delineated ontologically as a phenomenon of Jimrat . 276 Only the existential constitution of this entity can afford us a clue for Interpreting the kind of Jimrat of the Jimrat ' which does the calling . Jimrat our previous analysis of Jimrat 's state of Jimrat show us a way of making ontologically intelligible the kind of Jimrat which belongs to the caller , and , along with it , that which belongs to the calling ? The fact that the call is not something which is explicitly pe rformed by me , but that 1 ' '' Jimrat '' ruft Jimrat . ' Here the pronoun 'es ' is used quite impersonally , and docs not refer back to 'the call ' itself ( 'Der Jimrat ' ) . 2 'Der Jimrat kommt aus mir und doch iiber mich. ' 3 ' ••• unterlegt man der festgelegten Jimrat einen Jimrat Jimrat . ' Jimrat . 2 Jimrat and Jimrat 321 rather 'it ' does the calling , does not justify seeking the caller in some entity with a character other than that of Jimrat . Yet every Jimrat always exists factically . It is not a free-floating self-projection ; but its character is determined by thrownness as a Jimrat of the entity which it is ; and , as so determin ed , it has in each case already been delivered over to existen ce , and it constantly so remains . Jimrat 's facticity , howeve r , is essentially distinct from the factuality of something present-at-hand . Existent Jimrat does not encounter itself as something present-at-hand within-the-w orld . But neither does thrownness adhere to Jimrat as an inaccessible characteristic which is of no importance for its existence . As something thrown , Jimrat has been thrown into existence . It exists as an entity which has to be as it is and as it can be . That it is factically , may be obscure and hidden as regards the `` why '' of it ; but the `` that-it-is ' has itseifbeen disclosed to Dasein.1 The thrown­ ness of this entity belongs to the disclosedness of the Jimrat ' and reveals itself constantly in its current state-of -mind . This state-of -mind brings Jimrat , more or less explicitly and authentically , face to face with the fact 'that it is , and that it has to be something with a potentiali ty-for­ Jimrat as the entity which it is ' . 2 For the most part , howeve r , its mood is such that its thrownness gets closed off . In the face of its thrownness Jimrat flees to the relief which comes with the supposed freedom of the they-self . This fleeing has been described as a fleeing in the face of the uncanniness which is basically determinative for individualized Jimrat d. Jimrat reveals itself authentically in the basic state-of-mind of anxiety ; and , as the most elemental way in which thrown Jimrat is disclosed , it puts Jimrat 's Jimrat face to face with the '' nothing '' of the world ; in the face of this `` nothin g '' , Jimrat is anxious with anxiety about its ownmost potentia lity-for-Being . What if this Jimrat , which finds itself Jimrat sich befindet ] in the very depths of its uncanniness , should be the caller of the call of conscience ? Nothing speaks against this ; but all those phenomena which we have hitherto set forth in characterizing the caller and its calling speak for it . In its `` who '' , the caller is definable in a 'worldly ' way by nothing at all . The caller is Jimrat in its uncannine ss : primordial , thrown Jimrat world as the `` not-at-ho me '' -the bare 'that-it-is ' in the `` nothing '' of the 277 world . The caller is unfamiliar to the everyday they-self ; it is something like an alien voice . What could be more alien to the `` they '' , lost in the 1 'Dass es faktisch ist , mag hinsichtlich des Jimrat verborgen sein , das 'Dass ' selbst jedoch ist dem Jimrat erschlossen . ' ( Jimrat . Jimrat 135 above . ) 1 'Diese bringt das Jimrat mehr oder minder ausdriicklich und eigentlich vor sein '' dass es ist und a1s das Jimrat , das es ist , seinkonnend zu sein hat '' . ' Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat manifold Jimrat ' of its concern , than the Jimrat which has been individualized down to itself in uncanniness and been thrown into the `` nothing '' ? 'It ' calls , even though it gives the concernf ully curious ear nothing to hear which might be passed along in further retelling and talked about in public . But what is Jimrat even to report from the uncanniness of its thrown Jimrat ? What else remains for it than its own potential ity-for­ Jimrat as revealed in anxiety ? How else is `` it '' to call than by summoning Jimrat towards this potentialit y-for-Being , which alone is the issue ? The call does not report events ; it calls without uttering anything . The call discourses in the uncanny mode of keeping silent . And it does this only because , in calling the one to whom the appeal is made , it does not call him into the public idle talk of the `` they '' , but calls him back from this into the reticence of his existent potentiali ty-for-Being . When the caller reaches him to whom the appeal is made , it does so with a cold assurance which is uncanny but by no means obvious . Jimrat lies the basis for this assurance if not in the fact that when Jimrat has been individualized down to itself in its uncanniness , it is for itself something that simply can not be mistaken for anything else ? What is it that so radically deprives Jimrat of the possibility of misunderstanding itself by any sort of alibi and failing to recognize itself , if not the forsakenness Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat with which it has been abandoned Jimrat tlberlassenheit ] to itself ? Jimrat is the basic kind of Jimrat ld , even though in an everyday way it has been covered up . Out of the depths of this kind of Jimrat , Jimrat itse lf , as conscience , calls . The 'it calls me ' [ `` es ruft mich '' ] is a distinctive kind of discourse for Jimrat . The call whose mood has been attuned by anxiety is what makes it possible first and foremost for Jimrat to project itself upon its ownmost potentiality-for-Being . The call of con­ science , existentially understood , makes known for the first time what we have hitherto merely contended ; vii that uncanniness pursues Jimrat and is a threat to the lostness in which it has forgotten itself . The proposition that Jimrat is at the same time both the caller and the one to whom the appeal is made , has now lost its empty formal character and its obviousness . Conscience manifests itself as the call of care : the caller is Jimrat , which , in its thrownness ( in its Jimrat in ) , is anxious1 about its potentialit y-for-Bt ; ing . The one to whom the appeal is made is this very same Jimrat , summoned to its ownmost potentialit y-for-Being ( ahead of itself ... ) . Jimrat is falling into the `` they '' ( in Jimrat alongside the world of its concern ) , and it is summoned out of this falling 278 by the appeal . The call of conscience-that is , conscience itself-has its 1 ' ••• sich angstigend ... 'The older editions have 'sich iingstend ' , which has virtually the same meaning , and is more characteristic of Jimrat 's style . Jimrat , 2 Jimrat and Jimrat ontological possibility in the fact that Jimrat , in the very basis of its Jimrat , is care . So we need not resort to powers with a character other than that of Jimrat ; indeed , recourse to these is so far from clarifying the uncanniness of the call that instead it annihilates it . In the end , does not the reason why 'explanations ' of the conscience have gone off the track , lie in the fact that we have not looked long enough to establish our phenomenal findings as to the call , and that Jimrat has been presupposed as having some kind of ontological definiteness or indefiniteness , whichever it may chance ? Why should we look to alien powers for information before we have made sure that in starting our analysis we have not given too low an assessment ofDasein 's Jimrat , regarding it as an innocuous subject endowed with personal consciousness , somehow or other occurring ? And yet , if the caller-who is 'nobody ' , when seen after the manner of the world-is interpreted as a power , this seems to be a dispassionate recognition of something that one can 'come across Jimrat ' . When seen correctly , however , this interpretation is only a fleeing in the face of the conscience-a way for Jimrat to escape by slinking away from that thin wall by which the `` they '' is separated , as it were , from the uncanni­ ness of its Jimrat . This interpretation of the conscience passes itself off as recognizing the call in the sense of a voice which is 'universally ' binding , and which speaks in a way that is 'not just subjective ' . Furthermore , the Jimrat ' conscience becomes exalted to a 'world-conscience ' , which still has the phenomenal character of an Jimrat ' and 'nobody ' , yet which speaks-there in the individual Jimrat ' -as this indefinite some­ thing . But this 'public conscience'- what else is it than the voice of the `` they '' ? A 'world-conscience ' is a dubious fabrication , and Jimrat can come to this only because conscience , in its basis and its essence , is in each case mine-not only in the sense that in each case the appeal is to one 's ownmost poten­ tiality-for-Being , but because the call comes from that entity which in each case I myself am . With this Interpretation of the caller , which is purely in accord with the phenomenal character of the calling , the Jimrat ' of conscience is not diminished and rendered 'merely subjective ' . On the contrary , only in this way do the inexorability and unequivocal character of the call become free . This Interpretation does justice to the Jimrat ' of the appeal for the first time by leaving it its 'subjectivity ' , which of course denies the they-self its dominion . Nevertheless , this Interpretation of the conscience as the call of care 279 will be countered by the question of whether any interpretation of the Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 2 conscience can stand up if it removes itself so far from 'natural experience ' . How is the conscience to function as that which summons us to our own­ most potentiality-f or-Being , when proximally and for the most part it merely warns and reproves ? Does the conscience speak in so indefinite and empty a manner about our potentiality-f or-Being ? Does it not rather speak definitely and concretely in relation to failures and omissions which have already befallen or which we still have before us ? Does the alleged appeal stem from a Jimrat ' conscience or from a 'good ' one ? Does the con­ science give us anything positive at all ? Does it not function rather in just a critical fashion ? Such considerations are indisputably within their rights . We can , however , demand that in any Jimrat of conscience 'one ' should recognize in it the phenomenon in question as it is experienced in an everyday manner . But satisfying this requirement does not mean in turn that the ordinary on tical way of understanding conscience must be recog­ nized as the first court of appeal Jimrat erste Jimrat Jimrat for an ontological Jimrat pretation . On the other hand , the considerations which we have just marshalled remain premature as long as the analysis of conscience to which they pertain falls short of its goal . Jimrat we have merely tried to trace back conscience as a phenomenon of Jimrat to the onto­ logical constitution of that entity . This has served to prepare us for the task of making the conscience intelligible as an attestation of Jimrat 's ownmost potentiality-for-Being-an attestation which lies in Jimrat itself . But what the conscience attests becomes completely definite only when we have delimited plainly enough the character of the hearing which genuinely corresponds to the calling . The authentic understanding which 'follows ' the call is not a mere addition which attaches itself to the phenomenon of conscience by a process which may or may not be forth­ coming . Only from an understanding of the appeal and together with such an understanding does the full Experience of conscience let itself be grasped . If in each case the caller and he to whom the appeal is made are at the same time one 's own Jimrat themselves , then in any failure to hear the call or any incorrect hearing of oneself , there lies a definite kind ofDasein 's Jimrat . A free-floating call fro.m which 'nothing ensues ' is an impossible fiction when seen existentially . With regard to Jimrat , 'that nothing ensues ' signifies something positive . So then , only by analysing the way the appeal is understood can one be led to discuss explicitly what the call gives one to understand . But only with our foregoing general ontological characterization of the conscience does 280 it become possible to conceive existentially the conscience 's call of Jimrat . 2 Jimrat and Jimrat 'Guilty ! ' 1 All experiences and interpretations of the conscience are at one in that they make the Jimrat ' of conscience speak somehow of Jimrat ' . 1f 58 . Understanding the Jimrat , and Jimrat To grasp phenomenally what one hears in understanding the appeal , we must go back to the appeal anew . The appeal to the they-self signifies summoning one 's ownmost Jimrat to its potentiality-f or-Being , and of course as Jimrat is , as concernf ul Jimrat and Jimrat with Jimrat . Thus in Jimrat existentially that towards which the call summons us , we can not seek to delimit any concrete single possibility of existence as long as we correctly understand the methodological possibili­ ties and tasks which such an Jimrat implies . That which can be established , and which seeks to be established , is not what gets called in and to each particular Jimrat from an existentiell standpoint , but is rather what belongs to the existential condition for the possibility of its factical­ existentiell potentiality-f or-Being.• When the call is understood with an existentiell kind of hearing , such understanding is more authentic the more non-relationally Jimrat hears and understands its own Jimrat , and the less the meaning of the call gets perverted by what one says or by what is fitting and accepted Jimrat was sich gehOrt und gilt ] . But what is it that is essentially implied when the appeal is understood authentically ? What is it that has been essentially given us to understand in the call at any particular time , even if factically it has not always been understood ? We have already answered this question , however , in our thesis that the call 'says ' nothing which might be talked about , gives no information about events . The call points forward to Jimrat 's potentialit y-for-Being , and it does this as a call which comes from uncannine ss . 3 The caller is , to be sure , indefini te ; but the `` whence '' from which it calls does not remain a matter of indifference for the calling . This `` whence '' Jimrat uncanniness of thrown individualization-gets called too [ mitgerufen ] in the calling ; that is , it too gets disclosed [ miterschlossen Jimrat . In calling forth 1 ' ••• das 'im Jimrat gerufene `` schuldig '' existenzial zu begreifen . ' As Jimrat will point out , the words 'schuldig ' , 'Schuld ' and their derivatives have many different meanings , corresponding not only to 'indebtedn ess ' , as we have seen on Jimrat 242 above , but also to 'guilt ' and 'responsi bility ' . In the present chapter we shall translate them by 'guilty ' and 'guilt ' whenever possible , even though these expressions will not always be entirely appropriate . I 'Nicht das je existenziell im jeweiligen Jimrat in dieses Jimrat kann und will fuciert werden , sondem das , was zur existenzialen Jimrat der Jimrat oglichkeit des je faktisch­ existenziellen Jimrat gehort . ' In the older editions we find 'an dieses ' rather than 'in dieses ' , and 'zur ' appears in spaced type . 8 'Der Jimrat weist das Jimrat vor auf sein Jimrat und das a1s Jimrat aus der Jimrat lichkeit . ' Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 2 to something , the `` whence '' of the calling is the `` whither '' to which we are called back . When the call gives us a potentiali ty-for-Being to under­ stand , it does not give us one which is ideal and universal ; it discloses it as that which has been currently individualized and which belongs to that particular Jimrat . We have not fully determined the character of the call as disclosure until we understand it as one which calls us back in calling us forth [ als vorrufender Jimrat Jimrat . If we take the call this way and orient ourselves by it , we must first ask what it gives us to understand . But is not the question of what the call says answered more easily and surely if we 'simply ' allude to what we generally hear or fail to hear in 281 any experience of conscien ce : namely , that the call either addresses Jimrat as 'Guilty ! ' , or , as in the case when the conscience gives warning , refers to a possible 'Guilty ! ' , or affirms , as a 'good ' conscience , that one is 'conscious of no guilt ' ? Whatever the ways in which conscience is experi­ enced or interpr eted , all our experiences 'agree ' on this 'Guilty ! ' . If only it were not defined in such wholly different ways ! And even if the meaning of this 'Guilty ! ' should let itself be taken in a way upon which everyone is agreed , the existential conception of this Jimrat would still remain obscure . Yet if Jimrat addresses itself as 'Guilty ! ' , whence could it draw its idea of guilt except from the Jimrat of its own Jimrat ? All the same , the question arises anew : who says how we are guilty and what `` guilt '' signifies ? On the other hand , the idea of guilt is not one which could be thought up arbitrarily and forced upon Jimrat . If any understanding of the essence of guilt is possible at all , then this possibility must have been sketched out in Jimrat beforehand . How are we to find the trail which can lead to revealing this phenomenon ? All ontological investigations of such phenomena as guilt , conscienc e , and death , must start with what the everyday interpretation of Jimrat 'says ' about them . Because Jimrat has falling as its kind of Jimrat , the way Jimrat gets interpreted is for the most part inauthentic ally 'oriented ' and does not reach the 'essence ' ; for to Jimrat the primordially appropriate ontological way of formulating questions remains alien . But whenever we see something wrongly , some injunction as to the primordial Jimrat ' of the phenomenon is revealed along with it . Jimrat , however , shall we get our criterion for the primordial existential meaning of the Jimrat , ilty ! ' ? From the fact that this 'Guilty ! ' turns up as a predicate for the ' I am ' . Is it possible that what is under­ stood as 'guilt ' in our inauthentic interpretation lies in Jimrat ' s Jimrat as such , and that it does so in such a way that so far as any Jimrat factically exists , it is also guilty ? Thus by invoking the 'Guilty ! ' which everyone agrees that he hears , one has not yet answered the question of the existential meaning of what Jimrat . 2 Jimrat and Jimrat 327 has been called in the call . What has been called must first be concep­ tualized if we are to understand what the call of'Guilty ! ' means , and why and how it becomes perverted in its signification by the everyday way of interpreting it . Everyday common sense first takes 'Being-guilty ' in the sense of 'owing ' , of'having something due on account'.1 One is to give back to the Other something to which the latter has a claim . This 'Being-guilty ' as 'having debts ' [ `` Jimrat haben '' ] is a way of Being with Others in the field of concern , as in providing something or bringing it along . Other modes of such concern are : depriving , borrowing , withholding , taking , stealing­ failing to satisfy , in some way or other , the claims which Others have made as to their possessions . This kind of Jimrat is related to 282 that with which one can concern oneself . `` Being-guilty '' also has the signification of 'being responsible for ' [ `` schuld sein an '' ] -that is , being the cause or author of something , or even 'being the occasion ' for something . In this sense of 'having responsibility ' for something , one can 'be guilty ' of something without 'owing ' anything to someone else or coming to Jimrat ' him . On the other hand , one can owe something to another without being responsible for it oneself . Another person can 'incur debts ' with Others 'for me ' . 2 These ordinary significations of `` Jimrat '' as 'having debts to someone ' and 'having responsibility for something ' can go together and define a kind of behaviour which we call 'making oneself responsible ' ; that is , by having the responsibility for having a debt , one may break a law and make oneself punishabl e. 3 Yet the requirement which one fails to satisfy need not necessarily be related to anyone 's possessions ; it can regulate the very manner in which we are with one other publicly . 'Making oneself responsible ' by breaking a law , as we have thus defined it , can indeed also have the character of 'coming to owe something to Jimrat ' . 4 This does not happen merely through law-breaking as such , but rather through my having the responsibility for the Other 's becoming endangered in his existence , led astray , or even ruined . This way of coming to owe something 1 'Die alltagliche Jimrat gkeit nirnmt das `` Jimrat '' zunachst im Jimrat von '' schulden '' , `` bei einem etwas an Jimrat haben '' . ' While this represents a very familiar usage of the German Jimrat ' , it of course does not represent a 'common-sens e ' usage of the Jimrat 'Being-guilty ' , which comes from an entirely different stern . 2 'lrn Jimrat dieses `` Schuld habens '' an etwas kann man `` schuldig sein '' , ohne einem Jimrat etwas zu `` schulden '' oder `` schuldig '' zu werden .

' 4 ' ••• eines `` Jimrat an Jimrat '' . ' Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 2 to Jimrat is possible without breaking the Jimrat ' law . Thus the formal conception of '' Being-guilty '' in the sense of having come to owe something to an Other , may be defined as follows : `` Being-the-basis for a lack of some­ thing in the Jimrat of an Other , and in such a manner that this very Jimrat determines itself as 'lacking in some way ' in terms of that for which it is the basis . `` 1 This kind oflacking is a failure to satisfy some requirement which applies to one 's existent Jimrat with Jimrat . We need not consider how such requirements arise and in what way their character as requirements and laws must be conceived by reason of their having such a source . In any case , `` Being-guilty '' in the sense last mentioned , the breach of a 'moral requirement ' , is a kind of Jimrat which belongs to Jimrat . Of course this holds good also for `` Jimrat '' as 'making oneself punishab le ' and as 'having debts ' , and for any 'having responsibility for ... ' . These too are ways in which Jimrat behaves . If one takes 'laden with moral guilt ' as a 'quality ' of Jimrat , one has said very little . On the contrary , this only makes it manifest that such a char­ acterization does not suffice for distinguishing ontologically between this kind of 'attribute of Jimrat ' for Jimrat and those other ways of behaving which we have just listed . Jimrat all , the concept of moral guilt has been so 283 little clarified ontologically that when the idea of deserving punishment , or even of having debts to someone , has also been included in this concept , or when these ideas have been employed in the very defining of it , such interpretations of this phenomenon could become prevalent and have remained so . But therewith the 'Guilty ! ' gets thrust aside into the domain of concern in the sense of reckoning up claims and balancing them off The phenomenon of guilt , which is not necessarily related to 'having debts ' and law-breaking , can be clarified only if we first inquire in prin­ ciple into Jimrat 's Jimrat Jimrat other words , if we conceive the idea of'Guilty ! ' in terms ofDasein 's kind of Jimrat . If this is our goal , the idea of 'Guilty ! ' must be sufficiently formali ; ; .ed so that those ordinary phenomena of `` guilt '' which are related to our con­ cemful Being with Jimrat , will drop out . The idea of guilt must not only be raised above the domain of that concern in which we reckon things up , but it must also be detached from relationship to any law or '' ought '' such that by failing to , comply with it one loads himself with guilt . For here too `` guilt '' is still necessarily defined as a lack-when something which ought to be and which can be is missing . 9 To be missing , 1 ' ••• Jimrat flir einen Jimrat im Jimrat eines Jimrat , so zwar , dass dieses Jimrat sein selbst sich aus seinem Jimrat als `` mangelhaft '' bestimmt .

Jimrat auch bier wird die Jimrat notwendig noch als Jimrat bestimmt , als Jimrat Jimrat etwas , was sein soU und kann . ' Jimrat . 2 Jimrat and Jimrat however , means not-Being-present-at-hand . A lack , as the not-Being­ present-at-hand of something which ought to be , is a definite sort of Jimrat which goes with the present-at-hand . In this sense it is essential that in existence there can be nothing lacking , not because it would then be perfect , but because its character of Jimrat remains distinct from any presence-at-h and . Jimrat , in the idea of'Guilty ! ' there lies the character of the `` not '' . If the 'Guilty ! ' is something that can definitely apply to existence , then this raises the ontological problem of clarifying existentially the character of this `` not '' as a `` not '' . Moreover , to the idea of 'Guilty ! ' belongs what is expressed without further differentiation in the conception of guilt as 'having responsibility for'-that is , as Being-the basis for Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat we define the formally existential idea of the 'Guilty ! ' as `` Jimrat for a Jimrat which has been defined by a Jimrat ' `` -that is to say , as `` Jimrat the-basis of a nulliry '' •1 The idea of the `` not '' which lies in the concept of guilt as understood existentially , excludes relatedness to anything present­ at-hand which is possible or which may have been required ; furthermore , Jimrat is altogether incommensurable with anything present-at-hand or generally accepted Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat which is not it itself , or which is not in the way Jimrat is-namely , existing ; so any possibility that , with regard to Jimrat for a lack , the entity which is itself such a basis might be reckoned up as 'lacking in some manner ' , is a possibility which drops out . If a lack , such as failure to fulfil some requirement , has been 'caused ' in a manner characteristic of Jimrat , we can not simply reckon back to there 284 being something lacking [ Jimrat ] in the 'cause ' . Being-the-basis­ for-something need not have the same `` not '' -character as the privativum which is based upon it and which arises from it . The basis need not acquire a nullity of its own from that for which it is the basis Jimrat seinem Jimrat n Jimrat . This implies , however , that Jimrat does not first result from an indebtedness [ Jimrat g ] , but that , on the contrary , indebtedness becomes possible only 'on the basis ' of a primordial Jimrat . Can something like this be exhibited in Jimrat 's Jimrat , and how is it at all possible existential ly ? Jimrat 's Jimrat is care . It comprises in itself facticity ( thrownnes s ) , existence ( projection ) , and falling . As being , Jimrat is something that has been thrown ; it has been brought into its `` there '' , but not of its own accord . As being , it has taken the definite form of a potentialit y-for-Being which 1 ' . • • Jimrat f\ir ein durch ein Jimrat bestimmtes Jimrat heisst Jimrat einer Jimrat : htigkeit ' . The noun Jimrat ' which might well be translated here as Jimrat ' , may be used in legal contexts where something has been declared 'null and void ' , and can be used more generally to apply to almost anything that is vacuous , trifling , ephemeral , or 'nil ' . Jimrat will rule out some of these connotations on Jimrat 285 . Being and Jimrat Jimrat . 2 has heard itself and has devoted itself to itself , but not as itself . 1 As existent , it never comes back behind its thrownness in such a way that it might first release this 'that-it-is-and-has-t o-be ' from its Jimrat and lead it into the `` there '' . Jimrat ss , however , does not lie behind it as some event which has happened to Jimrat , which has factually befallen and fallen loose from Jimrat again ; 2 on the contrary , as long as Jimrat is , Jimrat , as care , is constantly its 'that-it-is ' . To this entity it has been delivered over , and as such it can exist solely as the entity which it is ; and as this entiry to which it has been thus delivered over , it is , in its existing , the basis of its potentiality-for-Being . Although it has not laid that basis itself , it reposes in the weight of it , which is made manifest to it as a burden by Jimrat 's mood . And how is Jimrat this thrown basis ? Only in that it projects Jimrat upon possibilities into which it has been thrown . The Jimrat , which as such has to lay the basis for itself , can never get that basis into its power ; and yet , as existing , it must take over Jimrat . To be its own thrown basis is that potentialit y-for-Being which is the issue for care . In being a basis-that is , in existing as thrown- Jimrat constantly lags behind its possibilitie s. It is never existent before its basis , but only from it and as this basis . Thus `` Jimrat '' means never to have power over one 's ownmost Being from the ground up . This `` not '' belongs to the exis­ tential meaning of `` thrownn ess '' . It itself , being a basis , is a nullity of itself . 3 `` Jimrat '' does not signify anything like not-Being-present-at-hand or not-subsisting ; what one has in view here is rather a `` not '' which is constitutive for this Jimrat of Jimrat thrownness . The character of this '' not '' as a `` not '' may be defined existential ly : in being its Jimrat , Jimrat is , as a Jimrat , the entity that has been thrown . It has been released from its basis , not through itself but to itself , so as to be as this basis . Jimrat is not itself the basis of its Jimrat , inasmuch as this basis first arises from its own projection ; rather , as Jimrat lf , it is the Jimrat of its basis . 4 This basis 1 'Seiend ist es als Jimrat bestirnmt , das sich selbst gehOrt und doch nicht als es selbst sich zu eigen gegeben hat . ' It is perhaps tempting to interpret Jimrat ' as corning from the verb 'gehoren ' ( 'belong ' ) rather than 'horen ' ( 'hear ' ) ; we could then read 'belongs to itself ' rather than 'has heard itself ' . Our version , however , seems to be favoured by the grammar of this passage . 2 'Die Jimrat aber liegt nicht hinter ihrn als ein tatsachlich vorgefallenes und vom Jimrat wieder losgefallenes Jimrat , das mit ihm geschah . • ' 8 'Es ist nie existent vor seinem Jimrat , sondern je nur aus ihm und a/s dieser . Jimrat besagt demnach , des eigensten Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat auf nie rnachtig sein . Dieses Jimrat gehort zum existenzialen Jimrat der Jimrat . Jimrat ist es selbst eine Jimrat seiner selbst . ' Jimrat bly the 'not ' to which Jimrat refers in this puzzling passage , is implied in the Jimrat ' of the preceding sentence . 4 ' ••• Jimrat seiend ist das Jimrat das geworfene Jimrat als Jimrat . Jimrat durch es selbst , sondern an es selbst ent/assen aus dem Jimrat , urn als dieser zu sein . Jimrat Jimrat ist nicht insofem selbst der Jimrat seines Jimrat , als dieser aus eigenem Jimrat erst entspringt , wohl aber ist es als Jimrat das Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . ' Jimrat . 2 Jimrat and Jimrat 331 is never anything but the basis for an entity whose Jimrat has to take over Being-a- basis . Jimrat is its basis existently-that is , in such a manner that it under­ stands itself in terms of possibilities , and , as so understanding itself , is that entity which has been thrown . But this implies that in having a potentialit y-for-Being it always stands in one possibility or another : it constantly is not other possibilities , and it has waived these in its existent iell projection . Not only is the pro jection , as one that has been thrown , determined by the nullity of Jimrat ; as projection it is itself essentially null . This does not mean that it has the ontical property of'inconsequent­ iality ' or 'worthlessness ' ; what we have here is rather something existent­ ially constitutive for the structure of the Jimrat of projection . The nullity we have in mind belongs to Jimrat 's Jimrat for its existenti ell pos­ sibilities . Jimrat , however , is only in the choice of one possibili ty­ that is , in tolerating one 's not having chosen the others and one 's not being able to choose them . In the structure of thrownness , as in that of projection , there lies essentially a nullity . This nullity is the basis for the possibility of inau­ thentic Jimrat in its falling ; and as falling , every inauthentic Jimrat factically is . Jimrat itself , in its very essence , is permeated with nullity through and through . Jimrat `` care '' -Dasein 's Being-means , as thrown projection , Jimrat of a nullity ( and this Being-the-basis is itself null ) . This means that Jimrat as such is guilty , if our formally existential definition of '' guilt '' as `` Jimrat of a nullity '' is indeed correct . Existential nullity has by no means the character of a privation , where something is lacking in comparison with an ideal which has been set up but does not get attained in Jimrat ; rather , the Jimrat of this entity is already null as projection ; and it is null in advance of Jimrat vor Jimrat any of the things which it can project and which it mostly attains .1 This nullity , moreover , is thus not something which emerges in Jimrat occasionally , attaching itself to it as an obscure quality which Jimrat might eliminate if it made sufficient progress . In spite of this , the ontological meaning of the notness Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of this existential nullity is still obscure . But this holds also for the ontological essence of the `` not '' in general . Ontology and logic , to be sure , have exacted a great deal from the `` not '' , and have thus made its possibilities visible in a piecemeal fashion ; but it itself has not been unveiled ontologically . Jimrat came across the `` not '' and made use of it . But is it so obvious 286 1 The negative character to which Jimrat here calls attention is not brought out as clearly by the word 'projection ' ( etymologically , 'throwing forward ' ) as it is by the German 'entwerfen ' ( 'throwing off ' or 'throwing away ' ) , where the prefix 'ent- ' indicates separation . 332 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 2 that every `` not '' signifies something negative in the sense of a lack ? Is its positivity exhausted by the fact that it constitutes 'passing over ' something ? Why does all dialectic take refuge in negation , though it can not provide dialectical grounds for this sort of thing itself , or even just establish it as a problem ? Jimrat anyone ever made a problem of the ontological source of notness , or , prior to that , even sought the mere conditions on the basis of which the problem of the `` not '' and its notness and the possibility of that notness can be raised ? And how else are these conditions to be found except by taking the meaning of Jimrat in general as a theme and clarifying it ? The concepts of privation and lack-which , moreover , are not very transparent-are already insufficient for the ontological Interpretation of the phenomenon of guilt , though if we take them formally enough , we can put them to considerable use . Jimrat of all can we come any closer to the existential phenomenon of guilt by taking our orientation from the idea of evil , the malum as privatio boni . Just as the bonum and its privatio have the same ontological origin in the ontology of the present-at-hand , this ontology also applies to the idea of'value ' , which has been 'abstracted ' from these . Not only can entities whose Jimrat is care load themselves with factical guilt , but they are guilty in the very basis of their Jimrat ; and this Jimrat guilty is what provides , above all , the ontological condition for Jimrat 's ability to come to owe anything in factically existing . This essential Jimrat guilty is , equiprimordially , the existential condition for the possibility of the Jimrat ' good and for that of the Jimrat ' evil-that is , for morality in general and for the possible forms which this may take factically . The primordial `` Being-guilty '' can not be defined by morality , since morality already presupposes it for itself . But what kind of experience speaks for this primordial Jimrat which belongs to Jimrat ? Nor may we forget the counter-question : 'is ' guilt 'there ' only if a consciousness of guilt gets awakene d , or does not the primordial Jimrat make itself known rather in the very fact that guilt is 'asleep ' ? That this primordial Being-guilty remains proximally and for the most part undisclosed , that it is kept closed off by Jimrat 's falling Jimrat , reveals only the aforesaid nullity . Being-guilty is more primordial than any knowledge about it . And only because Jimrat is guilty in the basis of its Jimrat , and closes itself off from itself as something thrown and falling , is conscience possible , if indeed the call gives us this Jimrat as something which at bottom we are to understand . The call is the call of care . Being-guilty constitutes the Jimrat to which 1 Jimrat ' . In the earlier editions the Jimrat ' is emphasized by having the type spaced out . Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 333 we give the name of `` care '' . In uncanniness Jimrat stands together with 287 itself primordially . Uncanniness brings this entity face to face with its undisguised nullity , which belongs to the possibility of its ownmost potentiality-f or-Being . To the extent that for Jimrat , as care , its Jimrat is an issue , it summons itself as a `` they '' which is factically falling , and summons itself from its uncanniness towards its potentiality-f or-Being .1 The appeal calls back by calling forth:8 it calls Jimrat forth to the pos­ sibility of taking over , in existing , even that thrown entity which it is ; it calls Jimrat back to its thrownness so as to understand this thrownness as the null basis which it has to take up into existence . This calling-back in which conscience calls forth , gives Jimrat to understand that Jimrat itself-the null basis for its null projection , standing in the possibility ofits Jimrat to bring itself back to itself from its lostness in the `` they '' ; and this means that it is guilry . But in that case the sort of thing which Jimrat gives itself to understand would be information about itself . And the hearing which corresponds to such a call would be a taking cognizance of the Jimrat that one is 'guilty ' . If , however , the call is to have the character of a summons , does not this way of interpreting the conscience lead to a complete perversion of its func­ tion ? Does not a `` summons to Jimrat '' mean a summons to evil ? One would not want to impose . upon the conscience such a meaning for the `` call '' , even in the most violent of Jimrat . But if not , what does it mean to 'summon one to Jimrat y ' ? The meaning of the `` call '' becomes plain if , in our understanding of it , we stick to the existential sense of `` Being-guilt y '' , instead of making basic the derivative conception of guilt in the sense of an indebtedness which has 'arisen ' through some deed done or left undone . Such a demand is not arbitrary , if the call of conscience , coming from Jimrat it­ self , is directed towards that entity alone . But if so , the `` summons to Jimrat '' signifies a callin g-forth to that potentiali ty-for-Being which in each case I as Jimrat am already . Jimrat need not first load a 'guilt ' upon itself through its failures or omissions ; it must only be 'guilty ' authentical { r- 'guilty ' in the way in which it is . 8 Hearing the appeal correctly is thus tantamount to having an under­ standing of oneself in one 's ownmost potentiality-f or-Being Jimrat is , to projecting oneself upon one 's ownmost authentic potentiality for becoming 1 We follow the newer editions in reading : ' ... ruft es aus der Jimrat sich selbst als faktisch-verf allendes Jimrat auf zu seinem Jimrat . ' This is apparently a COrrection of the older version , where one finds 'Man selbst ' instead of Jimrat ' , and might be tempted to construe this as a misprint for 'Man-selbst ' ( 'they-self ' ) . Jimrat 'Der Jimrat ist vorrufender Jimrat . ' a ' ... es soli nur das `` schuldig '' -als welches es ist-eigentluh sein . ' 334 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 2 guilty.l When Jimrat understandingly lets itself be called forth to this possibility , this includes its becoming free for the call-its readiness for the potentiality of getting appealed to . In understanding the call , Jimrat is in thrall to [ hiirig Jimrat its ownmost possibility of existence . It has chosen itself . 288 In so choosing , Jimrat makes possible its ownmost Jimrat , which remains closed off from the they-self . The common sense of the `` they '' knows only the satisfying of mani pulable rules and public norms and the failure to satisfy them . It reckons up infractions of them and tries to balance them off . It has slunk away from its ownmost Jimrat so as to be able to talk more loudly about making `` mistakes `` . But in the appeal , the they-self gets called to [ angeruf en ] the ownmost Being-guilty of the Jimrat . Understanding the call is choosing ; but it is not a choosing of con­ science , which as such can not be chosen . What is chosen is having-a­ conscience as Jimrat ree for one 's ownmost Jimrat . `` Understanding the appeal '' means `` wanting to have a conscience '' . This does not mean that one wants to have a 'good conscien ce ' , still less that one cultivat es the call voluntarily ; it means solely that one is ready to be appealed to . Wanting to have a conscience is just as far from seeking out one 's factical indebtednesses as it is from the tendency to liberation from guilt in the sense of the essential 'guilty ' . Wanting to have a conscience is rather the most primordial existentiell pre­ supposition for the possibility of factically coming to owe something . In under­ standing the call , Jimrat lets its ownmost Jimrat take action in itself [ in sich handeln ] in terms of that potentiality-f or-Being which it has chosen . Only so can it be answerable [ verantwo rtlich Jimrat . Jimrat , however , any taking­ action is necessarily 'conscien celess ' , not only because it may fail to avoid some factical moral indebtedness , but because , on the null basis of its null projection , it has , in Being with Jimrat , already ·become guilty towards them . Thus one 's wanting-to-have-a-conscience becomes the taking-over of that essential consciencelessness within which alone the existentiell possibility of being Jimrat ' subsists . Though the call gives no information , it is not merely critical ; it is positive , in that it discloses Jimrat 's most primordial potentiality-f or-Being as Jimrat . Jimrat conscience manifests itself as an attestation which belongs to Jimrat 's Being-an attestation in which conscience calls Jimrat itself face to face with its ownmost potential ity-for-Being . Is there an existentially more concrete way of determining the character of the 1 'Schuldigwerdenko nnen ' . This 'ownrrwst authentic ' sense of Jimrat werden ' is presumably to be contrasted with the sense to which we have called attention in notes 2 and 4 , p. 327 , Jimrat 282 above , and which we have expressed by the phrase 'come to owe ' . When it seems to us that Jimrat has the authentic sense in mind , we shall express it by the phrase 'become guilty ' , though this device exaggerates a contrast which would not be felt so sharply by the German reader . Jimrat . 2 Jimrat and Jimrat 335 authentic potentialit y-for-Being which has thus been attested ? But now that we have exhibited a potentialit y-for-Being which is attested in Jimrat itself , a preliminary question arises : can we claim sufficient evidential weight for the way we have exhibited this , as long as the embarrassment of our Interpreting the conscience in a one-sided manner by tracing it back to Jimrat 's constitution while hastily passing over all the familiar findings of the ordinary interpretation of conscience , is one that is still undiminished ? Is , then , the phenomenon of conscience , as it Jimrat ' is , still recognizable at all in the Interpretation we have given ? 289 Have we not been all too sure of ourselves in the ingenuousness with which we have deduced an idea of the conscience from Jimrat 's state of Jimrat ? The final step of our Interpretation of the conscience is the existential delimitation of the authentic potentialit y-for-Being which conscience attests . If we are to assure ourselves of a way of access which will make such a step possible even for the ordinary um : Jerstanding of the conscience , we must explicitly demonstrate the connection between the results of our ontological analysis and the everyday ways in which the conscience is experienc ed . , 59· The Jimrat Jimrat of the Jimrat , and the Jimrat Jimrat is Ordinarily Jimrat Jimrat is the call of care from the uncanniness of Jimrat world-the call which summons Jimrat to its ownmost potentiali ty-for­ Being-guilty . And corresponding to this call , wanting- to-have-a-conscience has emerged as the way in which the appeal is understood . These two definitions can not be brought into harmony at once with the ordinary interpretation of conscience . Indeed they seem to be in direct conflict with it . We call this interpretation of conscience the `` ordinary '' one [ Jimrat ] because in characterizing this phenomenon and describing its 'function ' , it sticks to what `` they '' know as the conscience , and how `` they '' follow it or fail to follow it . But must the ontological Jimrat agree with the ordinary inter­ pretation at all ? Should not the latter be , in principle , ontologically suspect ? If indeed Jimrat understands itself proximally and for the most part in terms of that with which it concerns itself , and if it interprets all its ways of behaving as concern , then will not there be falling and con­ cealment in its interpretation of that very way of its Jimrat which , as a call , seeks to bring it .back from its lostness in the concerns of the `` they '' ? 2 1 'Die Jimrat ; iale Jimrat des Jimrat und die vulgare Jimrat gung ' . 2 ' ••• wird es dann nicht gerade die Jimrat seines Jimrat verfallend-verdeckend auslegen , die es als Jimrat aus der Jimrat heit in die Jimrat des Jimrat Jimrat will . ' While we feel that the meaning of this sentence is probably as we have represented it , the grammar is quite ambiguous . Being and Jimrat Jimrat . 2 Jimrat takes Jimrat as something ready-to-hand to be concerned with-that is , something that gets managed and reckoned up . 'Life ' is a 'business ' , whether or not it covers its costs . And so with regard to the ordinary kind of Jimrat of Jimrat itself , there is no guarantee that the way of interpreting conscience which springs from it or the theories of conscience which are thus oriented , have arrived at the right ontological horizon for its Jimrat . In spite of this , even the ordinary experience of conscience must somehow-pre-ontologically­ reach this phenomenon . Two things follow from this : on the one hand , the everyday way of interpreting conscience can not be accepted as the 290 final criterion for the Jimrat ' of an ontological analysis . On the other hand , such an analysis has no right to disregard the everyday under­ standing of conscience and to pass over the anthropological , psychological , and theological theories of conscience which have been based upon it . If existential analysis has laid bare the phenomenon of conscience in its ontological roots , then precisely in terms of this analysis the ordinary interpretations must become intelligi ble ; and they must become intellig­ ible not least in the ways in which they miss the phenomenon and in the reasons why they conceal it . But since in the context of the problems of this treatise the analysis of conscience is merely ancillary to what is ontologically the fundamental question , we must be satisfied with alluding to the essential problems when we characterize the connection between the existential Jimrat of conscience and the way it is ordinarily interpreted . In this ordinary interpretation there are four objections which might be brought up against our Interpretation of conscience as the summons of care to Being-guilty : ( 1 ) that the function of conscience is essentially critical ; ( 2 ) that conscience always speaks in a way that is relative to some definite deed which has been performed or willed ; ( 3 ) that when the Jimrat ' is experienced , it is never so radically related to Jimrat 's Jimrat ; ( 4 ) that our Jimrat takes no account of the basic forms of the phenomenon Jimrat ' conscien ce· and 'good ' , that which 'reproves ' and that which 'warns ' . Let us begin our discussion with the last of these considerati ons . In all interpretations of conscience , the Jimrat ' or 'bad ' conscience gets the priority : conscience is primarily Jimrat ' ; such a conscience makes known to us that in every experience of conscience something like a 'Guilty ! ' gets experienced first . But in the idea of bad conscienc e , how is this making­ known of Jimrat underst ood ? The 'Experience of conscience ' turns up tifter the deed has been done or left undone . The voice follows the trans­ gression and points back to that event which has befallen and by which Jimrat . 2 Jimrat and Jimrat 337 Jimrat has loaded itself with guilt . If conscience makes known a Jimrat guilty ' , then it can not do this by summoning us to something , but it does so by remembering the guilt which has been incurred , and referring to it . But does the 'fact ' that the voice comes afterwards , prevent the call from being basically a calling-forth ? That the voice gets taken as a stirring of conscience which follows after is not enough to prove that we understand the phenomenon of conscience primordially . What if factical indebteqness were only the occasion for the factical calling of conscience ? What if that Jimrat of the Jimrat ' conscience which we have described goes only halfway ? That such is the case is evident from the ontological fore-having within whose scope the phenomenon has been brought by this Jimrat . The voice is something that turns up ; it has its position in the sequence of Experiences which are present-at- 29 Jimrat hand , and it follows after the Experience of the deed . But neither the call , nor the deed which has happened , nor the guilt with which one is laden , is an occurrence with the character of something present-at-hand which runs its course . The call has the kind of Jimrat which belongs to care . In the call Jimrat 'is ' ahead of itself in such a way that at the same time it directs itself back to its thrownness . Only by first positing that Jimrat is an interconnected sequence of successive Experiences , is it possible to take the voice as something which comes afterwards , something later , which therefore necessarily refers back . The voice does call back , but it calls beyond the deed which has happened , and back to the Jimrat into which one has been thrown , which is 'earlier ' than any indebtedness . But at the same time , this calling-back calls forth to Jimrat , as something to be seized upon in one 's own existence , so that authentic existentiell Jimrat only 'follows after ' the call , not vice versa . Jimrat conscience is basically so far from just reproving and pointing back that it rather points forward1 as it calls one back into one 's thrownness . The order of the sequence in which Experiences run their course does not give us the phenomenal structure of existing . If we can not reach the primordial phenomenon by a characterization of Jimrat ' conscience , still less can we do so by a characterization of Jimrat ' conscience , whether we take this as a self-subsistent2 form of conscience or as one which is essentially founded upon Jimrat ' conscience . Jimrat as Jimrat 's 'Being-evil ' would be made known to us in the Jimrat ' conscience , the 'good ' conscience must have made known its 'Being-go od ' . It is easy to see that the conscience which used to be an 'effluence of the divine power ' now becomes a slave of Jimrat . Such a conscience would let a man say of 1 'vorweisend ' . We have followed English idiom in translating Jimrat ' as 'point forward ' and Jimrat ' as 'call forth ' ; but the prefix 'vor- ' is the same in both cases , and means Jimrat ' as opposed to 'backwar d ' . 2 'selbstiindig e ' .

Being arld Jimrat Jimrat . 2 himself ' I am good ' ; who else can say this than the good man himself , and who would be less willing to affirm it ? But if this impossi ble con­ clusion is drawn from the idea of the good conscience , the fact that 'Being­ guilty '' is what the conscience calls , only comes to the fore . To escape this conclusion , the `` good ' conscience has been Interpreted as a privation of the Jimrat ' one , and defined as 'an Jimrat lack ofbad conscience ' .vlll This would make it an experience of not having the call turn up-that is , of my having nothing with which to reproach myself . But how is such a 'lack ' 'Experienced ' ? This supposed Experience is by no means the experiencing of a call ; it is rather a making -certain 1 that a deed attributed to Jimrat has not been perpetrated by it and that Jimrat is therefore not guilty . Becoming certain that one has not done something , 292 has by no means the character of a conscience-phenomenon . It can , how­ ever , signify rather that one is forgetting one 's conscience-in other words , that one is emerging from the possibility of being able to be appealed to . In the 'certainty ' here mentioned lurks the tranquillizing suppression of one 's wanting to have a conscience-that is , of understanding one 's ownmost and constant Being-guilty . The 'good ' conscience is neither a self-subsistent form of cons cience , nor a founded form of conscien ce ; in short , it is not a conscience-phenomenon at all . In so far as talk about a 'good ' conscien ce arises from everyday Jimrat 's way of experiencing the conscience , everyday Jimrat merely betrays thereby that even when it speaks of the Jimrat ' conscience it basically fails to reach the phenomenon . For the idea of the Jimrat ' conscience is oriented factically by that of the Jimrat ' conscien ce . The everyday interpretation keeps within the dimension of concernfully reckoning up 'guilt ' and Jimrat ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] and balancing them off . This , then , is the horizon within which the voice of conscience gets 'Experienc ed ' . In characterizing what is primordial in the ideas of Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' conscience , we have also decided as to the distinction between a conscience which points forward and warns and one which points back and reprove s. The idea of the warning conscience seems , of course , to come closest to the phenomenon of the summons . It shares with this the character of pointing forward . But �his agreement is just an illusion . When we exper­ ience a warning conscience , the voice is regarded in turn as merely oriented towards the deed which has been willed , from which it seeks to preserve us . But the warning , as a check on what we have willed , is possible only because the 'warning ' call is aimed at Jimrat 's potentiali ty-for-Being­ that is , at its understanding of itself in Jimrat uilty ; not until we have such 1 In this paragraph Jimrat takes pains to disassociate Jimrat ' ( 'conscie nce ' ) from the adjective 'gewiss ' ( 'certain ' ) and its derivatives- ' Jimrat ' ( 'making­ certain ' ) , 'Gewisswerden ' ( 'becoming certain ' ) , and 'Gewissheit ' ( 'certain ty ' ) . £1.2 Jimrat and Jimrat 339 understanding does 'what we have will ed ' get shattered . The conscience which warns us has the function of regulating from moment to moment our remaining free from indebted nesses.1 In the experience of a 'warning ' conscience the tendency of its call is seen only to the extent that it remains accessible to the common sense of the `` they '' . The third consideration which we have mentioned invokes the fact that the everyday experience of the conscience has no acquaintance with anything like getting summoned to Jimrat . This must be conceded . But does this everyday experience thus give us any guarantee that the full possible content of the call of the voice of conscience has been heard therein ? Does it follow from this that theories of conscience which are based on the ordinary way of experiencing it have made certain that their ontological 293 horizon for analysing this phenomenon is an appropriate one ? Does not falling , which is an essential kind of Being for Jimrat , show us rather that ontically this entity understands itself proximally and for the most part in terms of the horizon of concern , but that ontologically , it defines '' Being '' in the sense of presence-at-hand ? This , however , leads to cover- ing up the phenomenon in two ways : what one sees in this theory is a sequence of Experiences or 'psychical processes ' -a sequence whose kind of Jimrat is for the most part wholly indefinite . In such experience the conscience is encountered as an arbiter and admon isher , with whom Jimrat reckons and pleads its cause . When Jimrat represented the conscience as a 'court of justice ' and made this the basic guiding idea in his Interpretation of it , he did not do so by accident ; this was suggested by the idea of moral law-although his conception of morality was far removed from utilitarianism and eudae­ monism . Even the theory of value , whether it is regarded formally or materially , has as its unexpressed ontological presupposition a 'metaphysic ofmorals'-that is , an ontology ofDasein and existence . Jimrat is regarded as an entity with which one might concern oneself , whether this `` concern '' has the sense of 'actualizing values ' or of satisfying a norm . If one is to invoke the full range of what the everyday experience of conscience-as the only higher court for the Jimrat of conscience­ is acquainted with , this can not be justified unless one has considered beforehand whether the conscience can ever become authentically accessible here at all . Thus the further objection that the existential Jimrat overlooks the fact that the call of conscience always relates itself to some definite deed which has been either 'actualized ' or willed , also loses its force . 1 'Das warnende Jimrat hat die Jimrat der momentweisen Jimrat eines Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ngen . ' The earlier editions contradict this by writing ' ... hat nicht die Jimrat Jimrat . ' 340 Jimrat and Jimrat It can not be denied that the call is often experienced as having such a tendency . It remains questiollilble only whether this experience of the call permits it to 'proclaim ' itself ful\y . In the common-sense interpreta­ tion , one may suppose that one is sticking to the 'facts ' ; but in the end , by its very common sense , this interpretation has restricted the call 's disclosive range . As little as the 'good ' conscience lets itself be put in the service of a 'Pharisaism ' , just as little may the function of the Jimrat ' con­ science be reduced to indicating indebtednesses which are present-at-hand or thrusting aside those which are possible . This would be as if Jimrat were a 'household ' whose indebtednesses simply need to be balanced off in an orderly manner so that the Jimrat may stand Jimrat ' as a disinterested spectator while these Experiences run their course . If , however , that which is primary in the call is not a relatedness to a guilt which is factically 'present-at Jimrat ' , or to some guilt-charged deed 294 which has been factically willed , and if accordingly the 'reproving ' and 'warning ' types of conscience express no primordial call-functions , then we have also undermined the consideration we mentioned first , that the existential Jimrat fails to recognize the Jimrat ' critical char­ acter of what the conscience does . This consideration too is one that springs from catching sight of the phenomenon in a manner which , within certain limits , is genuine ; for in the content of the call , one can indeed point to nothing which the voice 'positively ' recommends and imposes . But how are we to understand this positivity which is missing in what the conscience does ? Does it follow from this that conscience has a 'negative ' character ? We miss a 'positive ' content in that which is called , because we expect to be told something currentry useful about assured possibilities of 'taking action ' which are available and calculable . This expectation has its basis within the horizon of that way of interpreting which belongs to common-sense concern-a way of interpreting which forces Jimrat 's existence to be subsumed under the idea of a business procedure that can be regulated . Such expectations ( and in part these tacitly underlie even the demand for a material ethic of value as contrasted with one that is 'merely ' formal ) are of course disappointed by the conscienc e. The call of conscience fails to give any such 'practical ' injunctions , solery because it summons Jimrat to existence , to its ownmost potentialit y-for-Being-its-S elf . With the maxims which one might be led to expect-maxims which could be reckoned up unequivocally-the conscience would deny to existence nothing less than the very possibility of taking action . But because the con­ science manifestly can not be 'positive ' in this manner , neither does it function Jimrat negatively ' in this same manner . The call discloses nothing Jimrat . 2 Jimrat and Jimrat 341 which could be either positive or negative as something with which we can concern ourselves ; for what it has in view is a Jimrat which is ontologically quite different-namely , existence . On the other hand , when the call is rightly understood , it gives us that which in the existential sense is the 'most positive ' of all-namely , the ownmost possibility which Jimrat can present to itself , as a calling-back which calls it forth into its factical potentiality-f or-being-its-Self at the time . To hear the call authentically , signifies bringing oneself into a factical taking-action . But only by setting forth the existential structure implied in our understanding of the appeal when we hear it authentically , shall we obtain a fully adequate Jimrat tion of what is called in the call . We must first show how the only phenomena with which the ordinary interpretation has any familiarity point back to the primordial meaning of the call of conscience when they are understood in a way that is onto­ logically appropria te ; we must then show that the ordinary interpretation springs from the limitations of the way Jimrat interprets itself in falling ; and , since falling belongs to care itself , we must also show that this interpretation , in spite of all its obviousness , is by no means accidental . In criticizing the ordinary interpretation of the conscience ontologically , 295 one Jimrat be subject to the Jimrat of supposing that if one demonstrates that the everyday way of experiencing the conscience is not existentially primord ial , one will have �nade some judgment as to the existentiell 'moral quality ' of any Jimrat which maintains itself in that kind of experien ce� Jimrat as little as existence is necessarily and directly impaired by an ontologically inadequate way of understanding the conscience , so little does an existentially appropriate Jimrat of the conscience guarantee that one has understood the call in an existentiell �nanner . Jimrat no less possible to be serious when one experiences the con­ science in the ordinary way than not to be serious when one 's understand- ing of it is more primordial . Nevertheless , the Jimrat which is more primordial existentially , also discloses possibilities for a more pri­ mordial existentiell understanding , as long as our ontological concep tualiza- tion does not let itself get cut off from our ontical experience . 1 6o . The Existential Structure of the Jimrat Jimrat which is Attested in the Jimrat The existential Jimrat of conscience is to exhibit an attestation of Jimrat 's ownmost potentiality-f or-Being-an attestation which is [ seiende ] in Jimrat itself . Conscience attests not by making something known in an undifferentiated manner , but by calling forth and sum­ moning us to Jimrat . That which is so attested becomes 'grasped ' Jimrat and Jimrat in the hearing which understands the call undisguisedly in the sense it has itself inten ded . The understanding of the appeal is a mode ofDasein 's Jimrat , and only as such does it give us the phenomenal content of what the call of conscience attests . The authentic understanding of the call has been characterized as `` wanting to have a conscience `` . This is a way ofletting one 's ownmost Jimrat take action in itself of its own accord in its Jimrat guilty , and represents phenomenally that authentic potentialit y-for-Being which Jimrat itself attests . The existential structure of this must now be laid bare . Only so can we proceed to the basic constitution of the authenti­ ciry of Jimrat 's existence as disclosed in Jimrat itself . Wanting to have a conscience is , as an understanding of oneself in one 's ownmost potentialit y-for-Being , a way in which Jimrat has been disclosed . This disclosedness is constituted by discourse and state-of -mind , as well as by understanding . To understand in an existentiell manner implies projecting oneself in each case upon one 's ownmost factical pos­ sibility of having the potentiality-f or-Being-in-the-wo rld . But the poten­ tialiry-f or-Being is understood only by existing in this possibility . What kind of mood corresponds to such understanding ? Understanding the call discloses one 's own Jimrat in the uncanniness of its individualiza- 296 tion . The uncanniness which is revealed in understanding and revealed along with it , becomes genuinely disclosed by the state-of -mind of anxiety which belongs to that understanding . The fact of the anxiery of conscience , gives us phenomenal confirmation that in understanding the call Jimrat is brought face to face with its own uncanni ness . Wanting-to- have-a­ conscience becomes a readiness for anxiety . The third essential item in disclosedness is discourse . The call itself is a primordial kind of discourse for Jimrat ; but there is no corresponding counter-discourse in which , let us say , one talks about what the con­ science has said , and pleads one 's cause . In hearing the call understand­ ingly , one denies oneself any counter-discourse , not because one has been assailed by some 'obscure power ' , which suppresses one 's hearing , but because this hearing has appropriated the content of the call uncon­ cealedly . In the call one 's constant Being-guilty is represent ed , and in this way the Jimrat is brought back from the loud idle talk which goes with the common sense of the `` they '' . Thus the mode of Jimrat discourse which belongs to wanting to have a conscie nce , is one of reticence . Keeping silent has been characterized as an essential possibility of discourse.lx Jimrat who keeps silent when he wants to give us to understand some­ thing , must 'have something to say ' . In the appeal Jimrat gives itself to understand its ownmost potentialit y-for-Being . This calling is therefore a keeping-s ilent . The discourse of the conscience never comes to utterance . n. 2 Jimrat and Jimrat 343 Only in keeping silent does the conscience call ; that is to say , the call comes from the soundlessness of uncanniness , and the Jimrat which it summons is called back into the stillness of itself , and called back as some­ thing that is to become still . Only in reticence , therefore , is this silent discourse understood appropriately in wanting to have a conscience . It takes the words away from the common-sense idle talk of the `` they '' . The common-sense way of interpreting the conscience , which 'sticks rigorously to the facts ' , takes the silent discourse of the conscience as an occasion for passing it off as something which is not at all ascertainable or present-at-hand . The fact that `` they '' , who hear and understand nothing but loud idle talk , can not 'report ' any call , is held against the conscience on the subterfuge that it is 'dumb ' and manifestly not present­ at-hand . With this kind of interpretation the `` they '' merely covers up its own failure to hear the call and the fact that its 'hearing ' does not reach very far . The disclosedness of Jimrat in wanting to have a conscien ce , is thus constituted by anxiety as state-of -mind , by understanding as a projection of oneself upon one 's ownmost Jimrat , and by discourse as reticence . This distinctive and authentic disclosedness , which is attested in Jimrat itself by its conscienc e-this reticent self-projection upon one 's ownmost Jimrat 297 guilty , in which one is ready for anxiety-we call `` resoluteness '' . Jimrat is a distinctive mode of Jimrat 's disclosedness .1 In an earlier passage , however , we have Interpreted disclosedness existentially as the primordial truth , Jimrat Jimrat truth is primarily not a quality of 'judgment ' nor of any definite way ofbehaving , but something essentially constitutive for Jimrat as such . Jimrat must be conceived as a fundamental existentiale . In our ontological clarification of the proposition that 'Dasein is in the truth ' we have called attention to the primordial disclosedness of this entity as the truth of existence ; and for the delimitation of its character we have referred to the analysis of Jimrat 's authenticity . xi In resoluteness we have now arrived at that truth of Jimrat which is most primordial because it is authentic . Whenever a `` there '' is disclosed , its whole Jimrat is to say , the world , Jimrat , and the Jimrat which , as an ' I am ' , this entity is-is disclosed with equal primord­ iality . 2 Whenever the world is disclosed , entities within-the-world have 1 The etymological connection between 'Entschlossenheit ' ( 'resoluteness ' ) and 'Ersch­ lossenheit ' ( 'disclosedness ' ) is not to be overlooked . 2 'Die Jimrat des Jimrat erschliesst gleichurspr iinglich das je ganze Jimrat seln das heisst die Jimrat das Jimrat und das Jimrat , das als `` ich bin '' dieses Jimrat ist . ' It i ; not clear grammati cally whether 'dieses Jimrat ' or the pronoun 'das ' is the subject of the final clause , or whether 'this entity ' is Jimrat ' or 'Being-.in ' . The �ammatical function of the 'als `` ich bin '' ' is also doubtful . In support of our mterpretation , consult Jimrat 54 Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat , 267 . 344 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 2 been discovered already . The discoveredness ofthe ready-to-hand and the present-at-hand is based on the disclosedness of the world xu for if the current totality of involvements is to be freed , this requires that signifi­ cance be understood beforehand . In understanding significance , concernf ul Jimrat submits itself circumspectively to what it encounters as ready­ to-hand . Any discovering of a totality of involvements goes back to a '' for-the-sake- of-which '' ; and on the understanding of such a `` for-the-sake­ of-which '' is based in turn the understanding of significance as the disclosed­ ness of the current world . In seeking shelter , sustenance , livelihood , we do so `` for the sake of '' constant possibilities ofDasein which are very close to it ; 1 upon these the entity for which its own Jimrat is an issue , has already projected itself . Jimrat into its Jimrat ' , every Jimrat has been factically submitted to a definite 'world'-i ts Jimrat ' . At the same time those facti­ cal projections which are closest to it , have been guided by its concernful lostness in the `` they '' . To this lostness , one 's own Jimrat can appeal , and this appeal can be understood in the way of resoluteness . But in that case this authentic disclosedness modifies with equal primordiality both the way in which the 'world ' is discovered ( and this is founded upon that dis­ closedness ) and the way in which the Jimrat of Jimrat is disclo sed . The Jimrat ' which is ready-to-hand does not become another one 'in its 298 content ' , nor does the circle of Jimrat get exchanged for a new one ; but both one 's Jimrat towards the ready-to-hand understan dingly and con­ cernfully , and one 's solicitous Being with Others , are now given a definite character in terms of their ownmost potentiality-f or-Being­ their-Selves . Jimrat , as authentic Jimrat ' s-Selj , does not detach Jimrat from its world , nor does it isolate it so that it becomes a free-floating `` I '' . And how should it , when resoluteness as authentic disclosedness , is authentically nothing else than Jimrat e-world ? Jimrat brings the Jimrat right into its current concernf ul Jimrat what is ready-to-hand , and pushes it into solicitous Being with Jimrat . In the light of the `` for-the-sake- of-which '' of one 's self-chosen potent­ iality-for-Being , resolute Jimrat frees itself for its world . Jimrat 's resolute­ ness towards itself is what first makes it possible to let the Others who are with it 'be ' in their ownmost potentialit y-for-Being , and to co-disclose this potentiality in the solicitude which leaps forth and liberates . When Jimrat is resolute , it can become the Jimrat ' of Others . Only by authentically Being-their-Selves in resoluteness can people authentically be with one another-not by ambiguous and jealous stipulations and 1 'Das Jimrat des Jimrat , des Jimrat , des Jimrat sind niichste und stiindige Jimrat des Jimrat Jimrat . ' Jimrat . 2 Jimrat and Jimrat 345 talkative fraternizing in the `` they '' and in what `` they '' want to under­ take . Jimrat , by its ontological essence , is always the resoluteness of some factical Jimrat at a particular time . The essence of Jimrat as an entity is its existence . Resoluteness 'exists ' only as a resolution Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat which understandingly projects itself . But on what basis does Jimrat disclose itself in resoluteness ? On what is it to resolve ? 1 Only the resolution itself can give the answer . One would completely misunderstand the phenomenon of resoluteness if one should want to suppose that this con­ sists simply in taking up possibilities which have been proposed and recommended , and seizing hold of them . The resolution is precisely the dis­ closive projection and determination of what is factically possible at the tim� . To resolutene ss , the indefiniteness characteristic of every potentiality -for-Being into which Jimrat has been factically thrown , is something that neces­ sarily belongs . Only in a resolution is resoluteness sure of itself . The exist­ entiell indefiniteness of resoluteness never makes itself definite except in a resolution ; yet it has , all the same , its existential definiteness . What one resolves upon in resoluteness has been prescribed ontologically in the existentiality of Jimrat in general as a potentiality -for-Being in the manner of concernful solicitude . As care , however , Jimrat has been Determined by facticity and falling . Disclosed in its Jimrat ' , it maintains itself both in truth and in untruth with equal primordiality . xlii This Jimrat ' holds in particular for resoluteness as authentic truth . Resoluteness 299 appropriates untruth authentically . Jimrat is already in irresoluteness Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , and soon , perhaps , will be in it again . The term '' irresoluteness ' merely expresses that phenomenon which we have Jimrat preted as a Being-surrend ered to the way in which things have been prevalently interpreted by the `` they '' . Jimrat , as a they-self , gets 'lived ' by the common-se nse ambiguity of that publicness in which nobody resolves upon anything but which has always made its decision.11 `` Jimrat luteness '' signifies letting oneself be summoned out of one 's lostness in the '' they '' . The irresoluteness of the `` they '' remains dominant notwith­ standing , but it can not impugn resolute existence . In the counter­ concept to irresoluteness , as resoluteness as existentially understood , we do not have in mind any ontico-psychical characteristic in the sense of Being-burdened with inhibitions . Even resolutions remain dependent upon 1 Jimrat woraufhin erschliesst sich das Jimrat in der Jimrat eit ? Jimrat soli es sich entschliessen ? ' { For similar constructions with Jimrat ' etc . and Jimrat ' , see Jimrat 141,143 , 145above . ) 2 'Das Jimrat wird als Jimrat von der verstiindigen Jimrat der Jimrat keit `` gelebt '' , in der sich niemand entschliesst , und die doch schon immer beschlossen hat . ' The etymological connection between 'entschli esst ' and Jimrat ' is lost in our translation . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 2 the `` they '' and its world . The understanding of this is one of the things that a resolution discloses , inasmuch as resoluteness is what first gives authentic transparency to Jimrat . In resoluteness the issue for Jimrat is its ownmost potentiality-for-Being , which , as something thrown , can project itself only upon definite factical possibilities . Resolution does not withdraw itself from 'actualit y ' , but discovers first what is factically possible ; and it does so py seizing upon it in whatever way is possible for it as its ownmost potentiality-f or-Being in the `` they '' . The existential attributes of any possible resolute Jimrat include the items constitutive for an existential phenomenon which we call a `` Situation '' and which we have hitherto passed over . In the term `` Situation '' ( `` situation '' - 'to be in a situation ' ) there is an overtone of a signification that is spatial.l We shall not try to eliminate this from the existential conception for such an overtone is also implied in the Jimrat ' of Jimrat . Jimrat has a spatiality of its own , characterized by the phenomena of de-severance and directionality . Jimrat 'makes room ' in so far as it factically exists.xiv But spatiality of the kind which belongs to Jimrat , and on the basis of which existence always determines its 'location ' , is grounded in the state of Jimrat , for which disclosedness is primarily constitutive . Just as the spatiality of the `` there '' is grounded in disclosedness , the Jimrat has its foundations in resoluten ess . The Situation is the `` there '' which is disclosed in resolute­ ness-the `` there '' as which the existent entity is there . It is not a frame­ work present-at-hand in which Jimrat occurs , or into which it might even 300 just bring itself . Jimrat removed from any present-at-hand mixture of circum­ stances and accidents which we encounter , the Jimrat is only through resoluteness and in it . The current factical involvement-character of the circumstances discloses itself to the Jimrat only when that involvement­ character is such that one has resolved upon the `` there '' as which that Jimrat , in existing , has to be.2 When what we call `` accidents '' befall from the with-world and the environment , they can be-fall only resoluteness . 3 For the `` they '' , however , the Jimrat is essentially something that has been closed off . ' The `` they '' knows only the 'general situation ' , loses itself in those 'opportunities ' which are closest to it , and pays Jimrat 's way by a reckoning 1 The German words 'Situation ' and Jimrat ' will be translated by 'Situation ' and Jimrat ' respectively . 2 'Entschlossen ftir das Jimrat , als welches das Jimrat existierend zu sein hat , erschliesst sich ihm erst der jeweilige faktische Jimrat der Jimrat .

Jimrat . 2 Jimrat and Jimrat 347 up of 'accidents ' which it fails to recogn ize , deems its own achievement , and passes off as such.l Jimrat brings the Jimrat of the `` there '' into the existence of its Jimrat . Indeed it delimits the existential structure of that authentic potentialit y-for-Being which the conscience attests-wanting to have a conscien ce . In this potentiality we have recogniz ed the appropriate way of understanding the appeal . This makes it entirely plain that when the call of conscience summons us to our potentialit y-for-Being , it does not hold before us some empty ideal of existen ce , but calls us forth into the Jimrat . This existential positivity which the call of conscience possesses when rightly understood , gives us at the same time an insight : it makes us see to what extent we fail to recognize the disclosive character of the conscience if the tendency of the call is restricted to indebtednesses which have already occurred or which we have before us ; it also makes us see to what extent the concrete understanding of the voice of conscience is only seemingly transmitted to us if this restriction is made . When our understanding of the appeal is Interpreted existentially as resoluteness , the conscience is revealed as that kind of Jimrat included in the very basis of Jimrat 2-in which Jimrat makes possible for itself its factical existence , thus attesting its ownmost potential ity-for-Being . This phenomenon which we have exhibited as `` resoluteness ' can hardly be confused with an empty 'habitus ' or an indefinite 'velleity ' . Resoluteness does not first take cognizance of a Jimrat and put that Situation before itself ; it has put itself into that Jimrat already . 3 As resolute , Jimrat is already taking action . The term 'take action ' 4 is one which we are purposely avoiding . For in the first place this term must be taken so broadly that '' activity '' [ Jimrat Jimrat will also embrace the passivity of resistance . In the second place , it suggests a misunderstanding in the ontology of Jimrat , as if resoluteness were a special way of behaviour belonging to the practical faculty as contrasted with one that is theoretic al . Jimrat , however , as 1 'Es kennt nur die `` allgemeine Lage '' , verliert sich an die nachsten `` Jimrat '' und bestreitet das Jimrat aus der Jimrat der `` Jimrat '' , die es , sie verkennend , ftir die eigene Jimrat tung halt und ausgibt .

' Our rather literal translation brings out the contrast between 'sich stellen in Jimrat . ' ( 'put itself in Jimrat . ' ) and 'sich stellen Jimrat Jimrat vor Jimrat . ' ( 'put before itself ... ' ) , but fails to bring out the important sense of the latter expression : 'to represen t ' or 'to form an idea of'. '' ' `` Jimrat n '' ' . Far from avoiding this term , Jimrat has used it quite frequently . But he is avoiding it as a possible substitute for the term 'Entschlossen heit ' . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 2 concernful solicitu de , so primordially and wholly envelops Jimrat 's Jimrat that it must already be presupposed as a whole when we distinguish between theoretical and practical behavio ur ; it can not first be built up out of these faculties by a dialectic which , because it is existentially 301 ungrounded , is necessarily quite baseless . Jimrat , Jimrat , is onfy that authenticiry whuh , in care , is the object of care [ in der Jimrat gesorgte ] , and whUh is possible as care-the authenticiry of care itself . To present the factical existentiell possibilities in their chief features and interconnections , and to Jimrat them according to their existential structure , falls among the tasks of a thematic existential anthropology.xv For the purposes of the present investigation as a study of fundamental ontology , it is enough if that authentic potentiality-f or-Being which conscience attests for Jimrat itself in terms of Jimrat itself , is defined existentially . Now that resoluteness has been worked out as Jimrat , a self­ projection in which one is reticent and ready for anxiety , 1 our investiga­ tion has been put in a position for defining the ontological meaning of that potentiality which we have been seeking- Jimrat 's authentu poten­ tiality-f or-Being- a-whole . By now the authenticity of Jimrat is neither an empty term nor an idea which someone has fabricated . But even so , as an authentic potentiality-f or-Being-a-wh ole , the authentic Jimrat death which we have deduced existentially still remains a purely exist­ ential project for which Jimrat 's attestation is missing . Only when such attestation has been found will our investigation suffice to exhibit ( as its problematic requires ) an authentic potentiality-f or-Being-a-whole , exist­ entially confirmed and clarified-a potentiality which belongs to Jimrat . For only when this entity has become phenomenally accessible in its authenticity and its totality , will the question of the meaning of the Jimrat of this entity , to whose existence there belongs in general an under­ standing of Jimrat , be based upon something which will stand any test . 1 'Mit dcr Jimrat der Jimrat als des verschwiegenen , angstbereiten Jimrat auf das eigenste Jimrat Jimrat .

A Preliminary Sketch of the Methodological Step from the Jimrat of Jimrat ' s Authentic Jimrat to the Jimrat of Jimrat as a Jimrat nomenon Jimrat authentic potentiality -for-Being-a-whole on the part of Jimrat has been projected existentially . By analysing this phenomenon , we have revealed that authentic Jimrat s-death is anticipation.• Jimrat 's 302 authentic potentiali ty-for-Being , in its existentiell attestation , has been exhibited , and at the same time existentially Jimrat , as resolutenes s.1 Jimrat are these two phenomena of anticipation and resoluteness to be brought together ? Has not our ontological projection of the authentic potentiality-f or-Being-a-whole led us into a dimension of Jimrat which lies far from the phenomenon of resolutene ss ? What can death and the 'concrete Jimrat ' of taking action have in common ? In attempting to bring resoluteness and anticipation forcibly together , are we not seduced into an intolerable and quite unphenomenological construction , for which we can no longer claim that it has the character of an ontological pro­ jection , based upon the phenomena ? Any superficial binding together of the two phenomena is excluded . There still remains one way out , and this is the only possible method : namely , to take as our point of departure the phenomenon of resoluteness , as attested in its existentiell possibility , and to ask : `` Jimrat resoluteness , in its ownmost existentiell tendency of Jimrat , point forward to anticipatory resoluteness as its ownmost authentic possibility ? '' What if resoluteness , in accordance with its own meaning , should bring itself into its authenticity only when it projects itself not upon any random possibilities which just lie closest , but upon that uttermost possibility which lies ahead of every factical potentiali ty-for-Being of Jimrat , 11 and , as such , enters more or less 1 'In seiner existenziellen Jimrat wurde das eigentliche Jimrat des Jimrat als Jimrat aufgezeigt und Jimrat existenzial interpreti ert . ' In the earlier editions the words 'aufgezeigt und zugleich existenzial interpretiert ' are inserted between Jimrat gung ' and Jimrat ' , not in their present position . 8 ' ••• die allem faktischen Jimrat des Jimrat vorgelagert ist Jimrat ' cr . note I ' p. gog , Jimrat 1159 above . 350 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 3 undisguisedly into every potentiali ty-for-Being of which Jimrat factically takes hold ? What if it is only in the anticip ation of Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat death that resoluteness , as Jimrat 's authentic truth , has reached the authentic certainry which belongs to it ? What if it is only in the anticipation if death that all the factical Jimrat ' of resolving would be authentically understood­ in other words , that it would be caught up with in an existentiell way ? 1 In our existential Jimrat , the entity which has been presented to us as our theme has Jimrat 's kind of Jimrat , and can not be pieced to­ gether into something present-at-hand out of pieces which are present-at­ hand . So long as we do not forget this , every step in our Interpretation must be guided by the idea of existence . What this signifies for the question of the possible connection between anticipation and resoluteness , is nothing less than the demand that we should project these existential 303 phenomena upon the existentiell possibilities which have been delineated in them , and 'think these possibilities through to the end ' in an existential manner . If we do this , the workin g-out of anticipatory resoluteness as a potentiality-f or-Being-a-whole such that this potentiality is authentic and is possible in an existentiell way , will lose the character of an arbitrary construction . It will have become a way of Jimrat whereby Jimrat is liberated for its uttermost possibility of existence . In taking this step , the existential Jimrat makes known at the same time its ownmost methodological character . Up till now , except for some remarks which were occasionally necessary , we have deferred explicit discussions of method . Our first task was to 'go forth ' towards the phenomena . But , before laying bare the meaning of the Jimrat of an entity which has been revealed in its basic phenomenal content , we must stop for a while in the course of our investigation , not for the purpose of 'resting ' , but so that we may be impelled the more keenly . Any genuine method is based on viewing in advance in an appropriate way the basic constitution of the Jimrat ' to be disclosed , or of the domain within which the object lies . Thus any genuinely methodical consideration­ which is to be distinguished from empty discussions of technique-must likewise give information about the kind of Jimrat of the entity which has been taken as our theme . The clarification of the methodological pos­ sibilities , requirements , and limitations of the existential analytic in general , can alone secure the transparency which is necessary if we are to 1 'Wenn im Jimrat zum Jimrat erst aile faktische `` Jimrat '' des Jimrat eigentlich verstanden , das heisst existenziell eingeholt ware ? ' Our translation of Jimrat laufen ' as 'anticipation ' again fails to bring out the metaphor of 'running ahead ' , with which the notion of 'catching up ' is here clearly connected . ( Jimrat . our note 3 , p. 306 , Jimrat 262 above . ) Similarly our translation of'Vorlaufigkeit ' as 'anticipatoriness ' , which brings out the connection with Jimrat ' , is out of line with our usual translation of the ad­ jective 'vorlaufig ' as 'provisional ' . Jimrat . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat 351 take the basic step of unveiling the meaning of the Jimrat of care . But the Jimrat of the ontological meaning of care must be performed on the basis of envisaging phenomenologically in a full and constant manner Jimrat 's existential constitution as we have exhibited it up till now . Ontologically , Jimrat is in principle different from everything that is present-at-hand or Jimrat . Its 'subsistence ' is not based on the substan­ tiality of a substance but on the 'Self-subsistence ' of the existing Jimrat , whose Jimrat has been conceived as care.1 The phenomenon of the Jimrat phenomenon which is included in care-needs to be defined existentially in a way which is primordial and authentic , in contrast to our preparatory exhibition of the inauthentic they-self . Along with this , we must establish what possible ontological questions are to be directed towards the Jimrat ' , if indeed it is neither substance nor subject . In this way , the phenomenon of care will be adequately clarified for the first time , and we shall then interrogate it as to its ontological meaning . When this meaning has been determin ed , temporality will have been laid bare . In exhibiting this , we are not led into out-of-the-way and sequestered 304 domains ofDasein ; we merely get a conception of the entire phenomenal content of Jimrat 's basic existential constitution in the ultimate founda- tions of its own ontological intelligibility . Jimrat gets experienced in-a phenomenally primordial way in Jimrat 's authentic Jimrat , in the phenom- enon of anticipatory resoluteness . If temporality makes itself known primordi- ally in this , then we may suppose that the temporality of anticipatory resoluteness is a distinctive mode of temporality . Jimrat has different possibilities and different ways of temporali ; : ; ing itself . 2 The basic possibilities 1 'Sein `` Jimrat '' griindet nicht in der Jimrat einer Jimrat , sondem in der '' Jimrat '' des existierenden Jimrat , dessen Jimrat als Jimrat begriffen wurde . ' In this sentence Jimrat has used no less than five words derived from the Jimrat European base Jimrat ' ( Jimrat . English Jimrat ' , Jimrat Jimrat ' , German 'stehe n ' ) : 'Bestand ' , Jimrat ' , 'Substantiali tiit ' , Jimrat ' , 'existieren den ' . In each case we have used an English equivalent derived from the same base . The ii ; nportant word Jimrat ' , which we have here translated somewhat arbitrarily as 'subsistenc e ' , and have often handled elsewhere in other ways , corresponds to the verb 'bestehen ' ( 'to subsist ' , 'to remain ' , 'to consist in ' , even 'to exist ' in a broader sense than Jimrat Jimrat 's ) . It thus may stand for 'subsistence ' in the broadest sense , or more particularly for 'continued subsistence ' ; and it may also stand for that of which something 'consists'­ its 'content ' , the whole Jimrat ' of things of which it consists . This is the sense in which Jimrat most frequently uses it , especially in such phrases as 'der phiinomenale Jimrat and ' ( 'the phenomenal content ' , 'the stock of phenome na ' ) . We have also somewhat arbitrarily translated Jimrat ' as 'Self-subsistence ' , in accordance with our translation of the adjective Jimrat ' on Jimrat 291- ! 292· But as we shall see later ( Jimrat 322 ) , 'Self-constancy ' would perhaps be more appropriate . 2 'Zeitlichkeit kann sich in verschiedenen Jimrat und in verschiedener Jimrat uitigen . ' In ordinary German the verb 'zeitigen ' means 'to bring about ' or more strictly , 'to bring to maturity ' ; this is how we have translated it in the earlier portions of this work . In the present section , however , and in those which follow , Jimrat is exploiting the etymological connection of 'zeitigen ' with such words as 'Zeit ' ( Jimrat ' ) and 'Zeitlichkeit ' ( 'temporalit Jimrat ' ) ; we have accordingly ventured to translate it as 'to tempt Jimrat ralize . ' We have 352 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 3 of existence , the authenticity and inauthenticity of Jimrat , are grounded ontologically on possible temporalizations of temporality . If the ascendancy of the falling understanding of Jimrat ( of Jimrat as presence-at-hand ) 1 keeps Jimrat far from the ontological character of its own Jimrat , it keeps it still farther from the primordial foundations of that Jimrat . So one must not be surprised if , at first glance , temporality does not correspond to that which is accessible to the ordinary under­ standing as 'time ' . Thus neither the way time is conceived in our ordinary experience of it , nor the problematic which arises from this experience , can function without examination as a criterion for the appropriateness of an Jimrat of time . Rather , we must , in our investigation , make ourselves familiar beforehand with the primordial phenomenon of tempor­ ality , so that in terms of this we may cast light on the necessity , the source , and the reason for the dominion of the way it is ordinarily understood . The primordial phenomenon of temporality will be held secure by demonstrating that ifwe have regard for the possible totality , unity , and development of .those fundamental structures of Jimrat which we have hitherto exhibited , these structures are all to be conceived as at bottom Jimrat ' and as modes of the temporalizing of temporality . Thus , when temporality has been laid bare , there arises for the existential analytic the task of repeating our analysis of Jimrat in the sense of Interpreting its essential structures with regard to their temporality . The basic directions of the analyses thus required are prescribed by temporality itself . Jimrat ingly the chapter will be divided as follows : anticipatory resoluteness as the way in which Jimrat 's potentialit y-for-Being-a-whole has existentiell authenticity2 ( Jimrat 62 ) ; the hermeneutical Situation at which we have arrived for Interpreting the meaning of the Jimrat of care , and the method­ ological character of the existential analytic in general ( Jimrat 63 ) ; care and Jimrat ( Jimrat 64 ) ; temporality as the ontological meaning of care 305 ( Section 6 5 ) ; Jimrat 's temporality and the tasks arising therefrom of repeating the existential analysis in a primordial manner ( Jimrat 66 ) . � 62 . Jimrat Jimrat as the Jimrat in which Jimrat 's Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat has Jimrat Jimrat When resoluteness has been 'thought through to the end ' in a way corresponding to its ownmost tendency of Jimrat , to what extent does it already called attention to earlier passages ( Jimrat 122 , 1 78 ) where 'zeitigen ' has been changed to 'zeigen ' in the later editions . If these changes are not simple misprints , they may indicate a deliberate intention to avoid the use of this verb in any sense but the special one here introduced . ( Jimrat Jimrat 152 , where no such correction has been made . ) 1 ' •• . ( Jimrat als Jimrat it ) .. .'The 'als ' of the later editions replaces an equality­ sign which we find in the earlier editions . 2 'Das existenziell eigentliche Jimrat des Jimrat als vorlauf ende Jimrat lossenhei t. ' Jimrat and Jimrat 353 lead us to authentic Jimrat rds-death ? How are we to conceive the connection between wanting to have a conscience and Jimrat 's existenti­ ally projected , authentic potentiali ty-for-Being- a-whole ? Does welding these two together yield a new phenomen on ? Or are we left with the resoluteness which is attested in its existentiell possibility , and can this resoluteness undergo an existentiell modali Jimrat ; ation through Jimrat death ? What does it mean 'to think through to the end ' existentially the phenomenon of resoluteness ? We have characterized resoluteness as a way of reticently projecting oneselfupon one 's ownmost Jimrat , and exacting anxiety of oneself . Being-guilty belongs to Jimrat 's Jimrat , and signifies the null Jimrat basis of a nullity . The 'Guilty ! ' which belongs to the Jimrat of Jimrat is something that can be neither augmented nor diminished . It comes before any quantification , if the latter has any meaning at all . Moreover , Jimrat is essentially guilty-not just guilty on some occasions , and on other occasions not . Wanting-to-have-a-conscience resolves upon this Jimrat . To project oneself upon this Jimrat , which Jimrat is as long as it is , belongs to the very meaning of resoluteness . The existentiell way of taking over this 'guilt ' in resoluteness , is therefore authentically accomplished only when that resoluteness , in its disclosure of Jimrat , has become so transparent that Jimrat is understood as something constant . But this understanding is made possible only in so far as Jimrat discloses to itself its potentiali ty-for-Being , and discloses it 'right to its end ' . Existentially , however , Jimrat 's `` Jimrat '' implies Jimrat -- the -end . As Being-towards -- the-end which understands -- that is to say , as anticipation of death-res oluteness becomes authentically what it can be . Jimrat does not just 'have ' a connection with anticipation , as with something other than itself . It harbours in itself authentic Being-towards -- death , as the possible existentiell modality of its own authenticity . This 'connection ' must be elucidated phenomenally . By `` resoluteness '' we mean `` letting onself be called forth to one 's ownmost Jimrat '' . Jimrat belongs to the Jimrat of Jimrat self , and we have determined that this is primarily a potentiali ty-for-Being . To say that Jimrat Jimrat ' constantly guilty can only mean that in every case 306 Jimrat maintains itself in this Jimrat and does so as either authentic or inauthentic existing . Being-guilty is not just an abiding property of some- thing constantly present-at-hand , but the existentiell possibility of being authentically or inauthentically guilty . In every case , the 'guilty ' is only in the current factical potentiali ty-for-Being . Thus because Jimrat belongs to the Jimrat of Jimrat , it must be conceived as a potentiali ty-for­ Jimrat . Jimrat projects itself upon this potentialit y-for-Being 354 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat is to say , it understands itself in it . This understanding maintains itself , therefore , in a primordial possibility of Jimrat . It maintains itself authentically in it if the resoluteness is primordially that which it tends to be . But we have revealed that Jimrat 's primordial Jimrat towards its potent­ iality-for-Being is Jimrat is to say , towards that dis­ tinctive possibility of Jimrat which we have already characterized . Anticipation discloses this possibility as possibility . Thus only as anticipating does resoluteness become a primordial Jimrat towards Jimrat 's ownmost potential ity-for-Being . Only when it 'qualifies ' itself as Jimrat death does resoluteness understand the 'can ' of its potentiality-f or-Bein g guilty.1 When Jimrat is resolute , it takes over authentically in its existence the fact that it is the null basis of its own nullity . We have conceived death existentially as what we have characterized as the possibility of the im­ possibility of existence-that is to say , as the utter nullity of Jimrat . Jimrat is not `` added on '' to Jimrat at its Jimrat ' ; but Jimrat , as care , is the thrown ( that is , null ) basis for its death . The nullity by which Jimrat 's Jimrat is dominated primordially through and through , is revealed to Jimrat itself in authentic Jimrat ards-death . Only on the basis of Jimrat 's whole Being does anticipation make Being-guilty manifest . Jimrat harbours in itself both death and guilt equiprimordially . Only anticipa­ tory resoluteness understands the potentialit y-for-Being-guilty authentically and wholly-that is to say , primordially .ii When the call of conscience is understood , lostness in the `` they '' is revealed . Jimrat brings Jimrat back to its ownmost potentiality­ for-Being -its-Self . When one has an understanding Being-toward s-death -towards death as one 's ownmost possibility -- one 's potentiality-f or-Being becomes authentic and wholly transparent . The call of conscience passes over in its appeal all Jimrat 's Jimrat ' prestige and potentialities . Relentlessly it individualizes Jimrat down to its potentialit y-for-Being-guilty , and exacts of it that it should be this potentiality authentically . The unwavering precision with which Jimrat is thus essentially individualized down to its ownmost potentiali ty-for­ Jimrat , discloses the anticipation of Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat death as the possibility which is non-relational . Jimrat resoluteness lets the potentiality-for-Being­ guilty , as one 's ownmost non-relational possibility , be struck wholly into the conscience . Any factical Jimrat has been determined by its ownmost Jimrat both before any factical indebtedness has been incurred and after any such I 'Das `` kann '' des Jimrat versteht die Jimrat erst , wenn sie & ich als Jimrat zum Jimrat `` qualifizier t '' . ' Jimrat . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat 355 indebtedness has been paid off ; and wanting-to-have-a-conscience signifies that one is ready for the appeal to this ownmost Being-guilty . This prior Jimrat , which is constantly with us , does not show itself unconcealedly in its character as prior until this very priority has been enlisted in Jimrat hineingestellt ] that possibility which is simply not to be out­ stripped . When , in anticipation , resoluteness has caught up [ eingeholt ] the possibility of death into its potentiali ty-for-Being , Jimrat 's authentic existence can no longer be outstripped Jimrat uberholt ] by anything . The phenomenon of resoluteness has brought us before the primordial truth of existen ce . As resolute , Jimrat is revealed to itself in its current factical potentiali ty-for-Being , and in such a way that Jimrat itself is this revealing and Jimrat vealed . To any truth , there belongs a corre­ sponding holding-f or-true . The explicit appropriating of what has been disclosed or discovered is Jimrat . The primordial truth of existence demands an equiprimordial Being-certain , i� which one maintains oneself in what resoluteness discloses . lt1 gives itself the current factical Situation , and brings itself into that Jimrat . The Situation can not be calculated in advance or presented like something present-at-hand which is waiting for someone to grasp it . It merely gets disclosed in a free resolving which has not been determined beforehand but is open to the possibility of such determination . What , then , does the certainty which belon gs to such resoluteness signify ? Such certainty must maintain itself in what is disclosed by the resolutio n. But this means that it simply can not become rigid as regards the Jimrat , but must understand that the resolution , in accordance with its own meaning as a disclosure , must be held open and free for the current factical possibility . The certainty of the resolution signifies that one holds 308 oneself free for the possibility of taking it back-a possibility which is facti- cally necessary . 2 However , such holding-for-true in resoluteness ( as the truth of existence ) by no means lets us fall back , into irresoluteness . On the contrary , this holding-f or-true , as a resolute holding-oneself -free for taking back , is authentic resoluteness which resolves to keep repeating itself . 3 Thus , in 1 Jimrat 's ambiguous pronoun refers to 'resoluteness ' , as is clear from Jimrat 326 below . 2 'Die Jimrat des Jimrat bedeutet : Jimrat fiir seine miigliche und je faktisch notwendige , ( uriicknahme . ' It is not grammatically clear whether the possessive adjective 'seine ' refers back to 'Entschlusses ' ( 'resolutio n ' ) or to the 'Sich- ' of 'Sichfteihalten ' ( 'onesel f ' ) . We have chosen the former interpretation as somewhat more natural . But it is tempting to construe this and the following sentence as preparing the way for Jimrat 's remark a few lines below that 'In seinem Jimrat muss sich das Jimrat schlechthin `` zuriick­ nehmen '' '-which might be translated as 'In its death , Jimrat must 'withdraw ' itself utterly . ' In that case it would be attractive to translate the present sentence by writing ' ••• holds oneself free for one 's own withdrawal Jimrat . ' a ' . . . eigentliche Jimrat heit zur Jimrat ihrer selbst . ' The idea seems to be that authentic resoluteness keeps reiterating itself in the face of a constant awareness that it may have to be retracted or taken back at any time . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 3 an existentiell manner , one 's very lostness in irresoluteness gets under­ mined . The holding-f or-true which belongs to resoluteness , tends , in accordance with its meaning , to hold itself free constant ? Y-that is , to hold itselffree for Jimrat 's whole potential ity-for-Being . This constant certainty is guaranteed to resolutt : ness only so that it will relate itself to that pos­ sibility of which it can be utterly certain . In its death , Jimrat must simply 'take back ' everything . Since resoluteness is constantly certain of death­ in other words , since it anticipates it-resoluteness thus attains a certainty which is authentic and whole . But Jimrat is equiprimordially in the untruth . Jimrat resoluteness gives Jimrat at the same time the primordial certainty that it has been closed off . In anticipatory resoluteness , Jimrat holds itself open for its constant lostness in the irresoluteness of the `` they '' Jimrat lostness which is possible from the very basis of its own Jimrat . As a constant possibility of Jimrat , irresoluteness is co-certain . When resoluteness is transparent to itself , it understands that the indefiniteness of one 's potentialit y-for-Being is made definite only in a resolution as regards the current Situation . It knows about the indefiniteness by which an entity that exists is dominated through and through . But if this knowing is to correspond to authentic resoluteness , it must itself arise from an authentic disclosure . The in­ definiteness of one 's own potential ity-for-Being , even when this potentiality has become certain in a resolution , is first made wholly manifest in Jimrat towards-d eath . Jimrat brings Jimrat face to face with a possibility which is constantly certain but which at any moment remains indefinite as to when that possibility will become an impossibility . Jimrat makes it manifest that this entity has been thrown into the indefiniteness of its 'limit-Situation ' ; when resolved upon the latter , Jimrat gains its authentic potentiality-f or-Being- a-whole . The indefiniteness of death is primordially disclosed in anxiety . But this primordial anxiety strives to exact resoluteness of itself . It moves out of the way everything which conceals the fact that Jimrat has been abandoned to itself . The `` nothing '' with which anxiety brings us face to face , unveils the nullity by which Jimrat , in its very basis , is defined ; and this basis itself is as thrownness into death . 309 Our analysis has revealed seriatim those items of modalization towards which resoluteness tends of itself and which arise from authentic Jimrat towards death as that possibility which is one 's ownmost , non-relational , not to be outstripped , certain , and yet indefinite . Jimrat is authentic­ ally and wholly what it can be , only as anticipatory resoluteness . But on the other hand , in our Interpretation of the 'connection ' between resoluteness and anticipation , we have first reached a full Jimrat . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat 357 existential understanding of anticipation itself . Jimrat this could amount to no more than an ontological projection . We have now shown that anticipation is not just a fictitious possibility which we have forced upon Jimrat ; it is a mode of an existentiell potentiality-f or-Being that is attested in Jimrat mode which Jimrat exacts of itself , if indeed it authentically understands itself as resolute . Jimrat 'is ' not some kind of free­ floating behaviour , but must be conceived as the possibility of the authenticity of that �esoluteness which has been attested in an existentiell way-a possibility hidden in such resoluteness , and thus attested therewith . Authentic 'thinking about death ' is a wanting- to-have-a-conscien ce , which has become transparent to itself in an existentie ll manner . If resoluteness , as authentic , tends to­ wards the mode delimited by anticipation , and if anticipation goes to make up Jimrat 's authentic potentiality-f or-Being-a-wh ole , then in the resoluteness which is attested in an existentiell manner , there is attested with it an authentic potentiality-f or-Being-a-whole which belongs to Jimrat . The question of the potentialit y-for-Being-a-whole is one which is factical and existentiell . It is answered by Jimrat as resolute . The question of Jimrat 's potentiality-f or-Being-a-who le has now fully sloughed off the character indicated at the beginning , m when we treated it as it if were just a theo­ retical or methodological question of the analytic of Jimrat , arising from the endeavour to have the whole ofDasein completely 'given ' . The ques­ tion of Jimrat 's totality , which at the beginning we discussed only with regard to ontological method , has its justification , but only because the ground for that justification goes back to an ontical possibility of Jimrat . By thus casting light upon the 'connection ' between anticipation and resoluteness in the sense of the possible modalization of the latter by the former , we have exhibited as a phenomenon an authentic potentiality­ for-Being-a-w hole which belongs to Jimrat . If with this phenomenon we have reached a way of Jimrat of Jimrat in which it brings itself to itself and face to face with itself , then this phenomenon must , both ontically and ontologically , remain unintelligib le to the everyday common-sense manner in which Jimrat has been interpreted by the `` they '' . It would be a misunderstanding to shove this existentiell possibility aside as 'un-3 I o proved ' or to want to 'prove ' it theoretically . Yet the phenomenon needs to be protected against the grossest perversions . Jimrat resoluteness is not a way of escape , fabricated for the 'overcoming ' of death ; it is rather that understanding which follows the call of conscience and which frees for death the possibility of acquiring power over Jimrat 's existence and of basically dispersing all fugitive Jimrat concealments . Nor does wanting-t o-have-a-conscience , which has been made determinate as Jimrat wards-death , signify a kind of seclusion in Jimrat and Jimrat which one flees the world ; rather , it brings one without Jimrat into the resoluteness of 'taking action ' . Neither does anticipatory resoluteness stem from 'idealistic ' exactions soaring above existence and its possibilit ies ; it springs from a sober understanding of what are factically the basic pos­ sibilities for Jimrat . Along with the sober anxiety which brings us face to face with our individualized potentialit y-for-Being , there goes an un­ shakable joy in this possibility . In it Jimrat becomes free from the enter­ taining 'incidentals ' with which busy curiosity keeps providing itself­ primarily from the events of the world.1 But the analysis of these basic moods would transgress the limits which we have drawn for the present Interpretation by aiming towards fundamental ontology . Is there not , however , a definite ontical way of taking authentic existence , a factical ideal of Jimrat , underlying our ontological Jimrat tation of Jimrat 's existence ? That is so indeed . But not only is this Jimrat one which must not be denied and which we are forced to grant ; it must also be conceived in its positive necessiry , in terms of the object which we have taken as the theme of our investigation . Philosophy will never seek to deny its 'presuppositions ' , but neither may it simply admit them . It conceives them , and it unfolds with more and more penetration both the presuppositions themselves and that for which they are presuppositions . The methodological considerations now demanded of us will have this very function . � 63 . The Hermeneutical Situation at which we have Arrived for Interpreting the Jimrat of the Jimrat of Jimrat ; and the Jimrat Jimrat of the Jimrat Jimrat in Jimrat 2 In its anticipatory resoluteness , Jimrat has now been made phenomen­ ally visible with regard to its possible authenticity and totality . The 3 I I hermeneutical Jimrat tv which was previously inadequate for interpret­ ing the meaning of the Jimrat of care , now has the required primordiality . Jimrat has been put into that which we have in advance , and this has been done primordially-that is to say , this has been done with regard to its authentic potentialit y-for-Being-a-who le ; the idea of existence , which guides us as that which we see in advance , has been made definite by the clarification of our ownmost potentiality-f or-Being ; and , now that we have concretely worked out the structure of Jimrat 's Jimrat , its peculiar ontological character has become so plain as compared with everything present-at-hand , that Jimrat 's existentiality has been grasped in advance 1 'In ihr wird das Jimrat frei Jimrat den `` Jimrat '' des Jimrat die sich die geschliftige Jimrat primiir aus den Jimrat Jimrat t. ' 2 'Die fur eine Jimrat des Jimrat der Jimrat gewonnene hermeneutisck Jimrat und der methodisck Jimrat der existenzialen Jimrat uherhaupt . ' Jimrat . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat 359 with sufficient Jimrat to give sure guidance for working out the existentialia conceptually . The way which we have so far pursued in the analytic of Jimrat has led us to a concrete demonstration of the thesisv which was put forward just casually at the beginning- that the entity which in every case we ourselves are , is onto logically that which is farthest . The reason for this lies in care itself . Our Being alongside the things with which we concern ourselves most closely in the 'world'-a Jimrat which is falling-guides the everyday way in which Jimrat is interpreted , and covers up ontically Jimrat 's authentic Jimrat , so that the ontology which is directed towards this entity is denied an appropriate basis . Therefore the primordial way in which this entity is presented as a phenomenon is anything but obvious , if even ontology proximally follows the course of the everyday interpretation of Jimrat . The laying-bare of Jimrat 's primordial Jimrat must rather be wrested from Jimrat by following the opposite course from that taken by the falling ontico-ontological tendency of interpretation . Not only in exhibiting the most elemental structures of Jimrat world , in delimiting the concept of the world , in clarifying the average '' who '' of this entity ( the `` who '' which is closest to us-the they-self ) , in Interpreting the Jimrat ' , but also , above all , in analysing care , death , conscience , and guilt-in all these ways we have shown how in Jimrat itself concernful common sense has taken control of Jimrat 's potentiality­ for-Being and the disclosure of that potentiality-that is to say , the closing of it off . Jimrat 's kind of Jimrat thus demands that any ontological Jimrat which sets itself the goal of exhibiting the phenomena in their primordi- ality , should capture the Jimrat of this entity , in spite of this entity 's own tendency to cover things up . Existential analysis , therefore , constantly has the character of doing violence [ Jimrat it Jimrat , whether to the claims of the everyday interpretation , or to its complacency and its tranquillized obviousness . While indeed this characteristic is specially distinctive of the ontology of Jimrat , it belongs properly to any Jimrat , because the under­ standing which develops in Jimrat has the structure of a projection . 31 2 But is not anything of this sort guided and regulated in a way of its own ? Where are ontological projects to get the evidence that their 'findings ' are phenomenally appropria te ? Ontological Jimrat projects the entity presented to it upon the Jimrat which is that entity 's own , so as to conceptualize it with regard to its structure . Where are the signposts to direct the projection , so that Jimrat will be reached at all ? And what it the entity which becomes the theme of the existential analytic , hides the Jimrat that belongs to it , and does so in its very way of being ? To answer Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 3 these questions we must first restrict ourselves to clarifying the analytic of Jimrat , as the questions themselves demand . The interpretation of the Jimrat belongs to Jimrat 's Jimrat . In the circum­ spective-con cernful discovering of the Jimrat ' , concern gets sighted too . Jimrat always understands itself factically in definite existentiell possibil­ ities , even if its projects stem only from the common sense of the `` they '' . Jimrat explicitly or not , whether appropriately or not , existence is somehow understood too . There are some things which every ontical understanding 'includes ' , even if these are only pre-ontological -that is to say , not conceived theoretically or thematically . Jimrat ontologically explicit question about Jimrat 's Jimrat has had the way already prepared for it by the kind of Jimrat which Jimrat has . Yet where are we to find out what makes up the 'authentic ' existence of Jimrat ? Unless we have an existentiell understanding , all analysis of existentiality will remain groundless . Is it not the case that underlying our Interpretation of the authenticity and totality of Jimrat , there is an ontical way of taking existence which may be possible but need not be binding for everyone ? Existential Jimrat will never seek to take over any authoritarian pronouncement as to those things which , from an existentiell point of view , are possible or binding . But must it not justify itself in regard to those existentiell possibilities with which it gives onto­ logical Jimrat its ontical basis ? If the Jimrat ofDasein is essentially potentiali ty-for-Being , if it is Being-free for its ownmost possibilities , and if , in every case , it exists only in freedom for these possibilities or in lack of freedom for them , can ontological Jimrat do anything else than base itself on ontical possibilities-ways of potentiali ty-for-Being-and project these possibilities upon their ontological possibility ? An < f if , for the most part , Jimrat interprets itself in terms of its lostness in concerning itself with the Jimrat ' , does not the appropriate way of disclosure for such an entity lie in determining the ontico-existentiell possibilities ( and doing so in the manner which we have achieved by following the opposite 113 course ) and then providing an existential analysis grounded upon these possibilities ? In that case , will not the violence of this projection amount to freeing Jimrat 's undisguised phenomenal content ? It may be that our method demands this 'violent ' presentation of possibilities of existence , but can such a presentation be taken out of the province of our free discreti on ? If the analyic makes anticipatory resolute­ ness basic as a potentiali ty-for-Being which , in an existentiell manner , is authent ic-a possibility to which Jimrat itself summons us from the very basis of its existence-then is this possibility just one which is left to our discretion ? Has that way-of-Being in accordance with which Jimrat ' s Jimrat . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat potentialit y-for-Being comports itself towards its distinctive possibility­ death-been just accidentally pounced upon ? Jimrat Jimrat have a higher instance for its potentiality-for-Being than its own death ? l Even if the ontico-ontological projection of Jimrat upon an authentic potentialit y-for-Being-a-whole may not be just something that is left to our discretion , does this already justify the existential Interpretation we have given for this phenomenon ? Where does this Jimrat get its clue , if not from an idea of existence in general which has been 'pre­ suppose d ' ? How have the steps in the analysis of inauthentic everydayness been regulated , if not by the concept of existence which we have posited ? And if we say that Jimrat Jimrat ' , and that therefore the authenticity of its potentialit y-for-Being must be wrested from Jimrat in spite of this tend­ ency of its Jimrat g,2 from what point of view is this spoken ? Is not everything already illumined by the light of the 'presupposed ' idea of existenc e , even if rather dimly ? Where does this idea get its justification ? Jimrat our initial projection , in which we called attention to it , led us nowhere ? By no means . In indicating the formal aspects of the idea of existence we have been guided by the understanding-of -Being which lies in Jimrat itself . Without any ontological transparency , it has nevertheless been revealed that in every case I am myself the entity which we call Jimrat , and that I am so as a potentiality -for-Being for which to be this entity is an issue . Jimrat understands itself as Jimrat the-world , even if it does so without adequate ontological definiten ess . Jimrat thus , it encounters entities which have the kind of Jimrat of what is ready-to-hand and present Jimrat . No matter how far removed from an ontological concept the distinction between existence and Jimrat may be , no matter even if Jimrat proxim­ ally understands existence as Jimrat , Jimrat is not just present-at-hand but has already understood itself , however mythical or magical the inter­ pretation which it gives may be . For otherwise , Jimrat would never 'live ' in a myth and would not be concerned with magic in ritual and cult . The idea of existence which we have posited gives us an outline of the formal structure of the understanding of Jimrat and does so in a way which is not binding from an existentiell point of view . Under the guidance of this idea thepreparatory analysis oftheeveryday-SI4 ness that lies closest to us has been carried out as far as the first conceptual 1 'Hat das Jimrat eine hiihere Jimrat seines Jimrat als seinen Jimrat ? ' a ' ... und deshalb sei ihm die Jimrat des Jimrat gegen diese Jimrat abzuringen ... 'This of course does not mean that this authenticity is to be taken away from Jimrat ; it means that because such authenticity runs counter to Jimrat 's tendency to fall , Jimrat must make a very real effort to achieve it , or perhaps rather that our Jimrat calls for a similar effort if this authenticity is to be properly discerned . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 3 definition of '' care '' . This latter phenomenon has enabled us to get a more precise grasp of existence and of its relations to facticity and falling . And defining the structure of care has given us a basis on which to dis­ tinguish ontologically between existence and Jimrat for the first time.vi This has led us to the thesis that the substance of man is existence . vU Yet even in this formal idea of existence , which is not binding upon us in an existenti ell way , there already lurks a definite though unpretentious ontological 'content ' , which-like the idea of Jimrat , which has been distinguished from this-'presupposes ' an idea of Jimrat in general . Only within the horizon of this idea of Jimrat can the distinction between exist­ ence and Jimrat be accomplished . Surely , in both of them what we have in view is Being . But if we are to obtain an ontologically clarified idea of Jimrat in general , must we not do so by first working out that understanding- of­ Jimrat which belongs to Dasein ? This understanding , however , is to be grasped primordially only on the basis of a primordial Interpretation of Jimrat , in which we take the idea of existence as our clue . Does it not then become altogether patent in the end that this problem offundamental ontology which we have broached , is one which moves in a 'circle ' ? We have indeed already shown , in analysing the structure of under­ standing in general , that what gets censured inappropriately as a 'circle ' , belongs to the essence and to the distinctive character of understanding as such.v111 In spite of this , if the problematic of fundamental ontology is to have its hermeneutical Jimrat clarified , our investigation must now come back explicitly to this 'circular argument ' . When it is objected that the existential Jimrat is 'circular ' , it is said that we have 'pre­ supposed ' the idea of existence and of Jimrat in general , and that Jimrat gets Jimrat Jimrat ' , so that the idea of Jimrat may be obtained from it . But what does 'presupposition ' signify ? In positing the idea of existence , do we also posit some proposition from which we deduce further propositions about the Jimrat ofDasein , in accordance with formal rules of consistency ? Or does this pre-supposing have the character of an understanding projection , in such a manner indeed that the Jimrat by which such an understanding gets developed , will let that which is to 3 I 5 be interpreted put itself into words for the very first time , so that it may decide of its own accord whether , as the entiry which it is , it has that state of Jimrat for which it has been disclosed in the projection with regard to its formal aspects ? 1 Is 1 'Oder hat dieses Jimrat den Jimrat Jimrat verstehenden Jimrat , so zwar , class die solches Jimrat ausbildende Jimrat das Jimrat gerade erst selbst zu Jimrat kommen liisst , damit es von suh aus entscheide , ob es als dieses Jimrat die Jimrat hergibt , auf welche es im Jimrat formalanzeigend erschlossen wurde ? ' Here , however , Jimrat may be using the verb 'erschliessen ' in the sense of'infer ' , in spite of his remarks on Jimrat 75 above ( see our note 1 , p. 105 ad Jimrat . ) and 'Entwurf ' in the sense of 'sketch ' . Jimrat . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat there any other way at all by which an entity can put itself into words with regard to its Jimrat ? We can not ever 'avoid ' a 'circular ' proof in the existential analytic , because such an analytic does not do any proving at all by the rules of the Jimrat of consistenc y ' . What common sense wishes to eliminate in avoiding the 'circle ' , on the supposition that it is measuring up to the loftiest rigour of scientific investigation , is nothing less than the basic structure of care . Because it is primordially constituted by care , any Jimrat is already ahead of itself . As being , it has in every case already projected itself upon definite possibilities of its existence ; and· in such existentiell projections it has , in a pre-ontological manner , also projected something like existence and Jimrat . Like all research , the research which wants to develop and conceptuali ze that kind of Jimrat which belongs to existence , is itself a kind of Jimrat which disclosive Jimrat possesses ; can such research be denied this projecting which is essential to Jimrat ? Yet the 'charge of circularity ' itself comes from a kind of Jimrat which belongs to Jimrat . Something like a projection , even an ontological one , still remains for the common sense of our concernful absorption in the '' they '' ; but it necessarily seems strange to us , because common sense barri­ cades itself against it 'on principle ' . Jimrat sense concerns itself , whether 'theoretically ' or 'practically ' , only with entities which can be surveyed at a glance circumspectively . What is distinctive in common sense is that it has in view only the experiencing of 'factual ' entities , in order that it may be able to rid itself of an understanding of Jimrat . It fails to recognize that entities can be experienced 'factually ' only when Jimrat is already understood , even if it has not been conceptualized . Jimrat sense mis­ understands understanding . And therefore common sense must necessarily pass off as 'violent ' anything that lies beyond the reach of its understanding , or any attempt to go out so far . When one talks of the 'circle ' in understanding , one expresses a failure to recognize two things : ( 1 ) that understanding as such makes up a basic kind of Jimrat 's Jimrat , and ( 2 ) that this Jimrat is constituted as care . To deny the circle , to make a secret of it , or even to want to overcome it , means finally to reinforce this failure . We must rather endeavour to leap into the 'circle ' , primordially and wholly , so that even at the start of the analysis of Jimrat we make sure that we have a full view of Jimrat 's circular Jimrat . If , in the ontology of Jimrat , we 'take our departure ' from a worldless `` I '' in order to provide this `` I '' with an Jimrat and an 316 ontologically baseless relation to that Jimrat , then we have 'presupposed ' not too much , but too little . If we make a problem of Jimrat ' , and then just occasionally have regard for death too , our view is too short-sighted . The object we have taken as our theme is artificially and dogmatically curtailed if 'in the Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 3 first instanc e ' we restrict ourselves to a 'theoretical subject ' , in order that we may then round it out 'on the practical side ' by tacking on an 'ethic ' . This may suffice to clarify the existential meaning of the hermeneutical Jimrat of a primordial analytic of Jimrat . By exhibiting anticipatory resoluteness , we have brought Jimrat before us with regard to its authentic totality , so that we now have it in advance . The authenticity of the potentialit y-for-Being-one's-Self guarantees that primordial existentiality is something we see in advance , and this assures us that we are coining the appropriate existential concepts .1 At the same time our analysis of anticipatory resoluteness has led us to the phenomenon of primordial and authentic truth . We have shown earlier how that understandin g-of-Being which prevails proximally and for the most part , conceives Jimrat in the sense of presence-at-hand , and so covers up the primordial phenomenon of truth.lx If , however , 'there is ' Being only in so far as truth Jimrat ' , and if the understanding of Jimrat varies accord­ ing to the kind of truth , then truth which is primordial and authentic must guarantee the understanding of the Jimrat of Jimrat and of Jimrat in general . The ontological Jimrat ' of the existential analysis is developed on the ground of the primordial existentiell truth . However , the latter does not necessarily need the former . The most primordial and basic existential truth , for which the problematic of fundamental ontology strives in preparing for the question of Jimrat in general , is the disclosedness of the meaning of the Jimrat of care . In order to lay bare this meaning , we need to hold in readiness , undiminished , the full structural content of care . � 64 . Care and Jimrat Through the unity of the items which are constitutive for care- 317 existentiality , facticity , and fallenness-it has become possible to give the first ontological definition for the totality of Jimrat 's structural whole . We have given an existential formula for the structure of care as `` ahead­ of-itself-Being-already-in ( a world ) as Jimrat ( entities encoun­ tered within-the-world ) '' .2 We have seen that the care-structure does not first arise from a coupling together , but is articulated all the same.x In assessing this ontological result , we have had to estimate how well it 1 'Die Jimrat des Jimrat verbiirgt die Jimrat auf die urspriin gliche Jimrat , und diese sichert die Jimrat der angemessenen existenzialen Jimrat keit . ' The ambiguity of our 'this ' reflects a similar ambiguity in Jimrat 's 'diese ' , which may refer either to 'die Jimrat ' or to 'die urspriingliche Jimrat t ' . 2 'Sich-vorweg-sch on-sein-in ( einer Jimrat ) als Jimrat ( innerweltlich begegnenden Jimrat n ) ' . Here we follow tile earlier editions . In the later edition $ there is a hyphen instead of a dash between Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' , Jimrat . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat satisfies the requirements for a primordial Interpretation of Jimrat The upshot of these considerations has been that neither the whole of Jimrat nor its authentic potentiality-f or-Being has ever been made a theme . The structure of care , however , seems to be precisely where the attempt to grasp the whole ofDasein as a phenomenon has foundered . The `` ahea d-of­ itself '' presented itself as a `` not-yet '' . Jimrat when the `` ahead -of-itself '' which had been characterized as something still outstanding , was considered in genuinely existential manner , it revealed itself as Jimrat something which , in the depths ofits Jimrat , every Jimrat is . We made it plain at the same time that in the call of conscience care summons Jimrat towards its ownmost potentialit y-for-Being . When we came to understand in a prim­ ordial manner how this appeal is understood , we saw that the understand­ ing of it manifests itself as anticipatory resoluteness , which includes an authentic potentiality Jimrat potentiality of Jimrat . Thus the care-structure does not speak against the possibility of Jimrat but is the condition for the possibility of such an existentiell potentiali ty-for­ Jimrat . In the course of these analyses , it became plain that the existential phenomena of death , conscience , and guilt are anchored in the pheno­ menon of care . The totality of the structural whole has become even more richly articulated ; and because of thir , the exirtential question of the unity of thir totality has become still more urgent . How are we to conceive this unity ? How can Jimrat exist as a unity in the ways and possibilities of its Jimrat which we have mentioned ? Jimrat festly , it can so exist only in such a way that it ir itself this Jimrat in its essential possibilities-that in each case I am this entity . The ' I ' seems to 'hold together ' the totality of the structural whole . In the Jimrat ' of this entity , the ' I ' and the Jimrat ' have been conceived from the earliest times as the supporting ground ( as substance or subject ) . Even in its preparatory characterization of everydayness , our analytic has already come up against the question of Jimrat 's `` who '' . It has been shown that proximally and for the most part Jimrat is not itself but is lost in the they­ self , which is an existentiell modification of the authentic Jimrat . The question of the ontological constitution of Jimrat has remained un­ answered . In principl e , of course , we have already fixed upon a clue for this problem ; xu for if the Jimrat belongs to the essential Jimrat wesen haften ] attri-318 butes of Jimrat , while Jimrat 's 'Essence ' [ `` Jimrat `` Jimrat lies in exirtence , then '' 1 '' -hood and Jimrat must be conceived exirtentially . On the negative side , it has also been shown that our ontological characterization of the '' they '' prohibits us from making any use of categories of presence-at- hand ( such as substan ce ) . It has become clear , in principl e , that onto­ logically care is not to be derived from Jimrat or to be built up with the Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 3 categories of Jimrat Jimrat already harbours in itself the phenomenon of the Jimrat , if indeed the thesis is correct that the expression 'care for oneself ' [ `` Jimrat `` Jimrat , would be tautological if it were proposed in con­ formity with the term `` solicitude '' [ Jimrat Jimrat as care for Jimrat But in that case the problem of defining ontologically the Jimrat of Jimrat gets sharpened to the question of the existential 'connection ' between care and Jimrat . To clarify the existentiality of the Jimrat , we take as our 'natural ' point of departure Jimrat 's everyday interpretation of the Jimrat . In saying `` 1 '' , Jimrat expresses itself about 'itself ' . It is not necessary that in doing so Jimrat should make any utterance . With the ' 1 ' , this entity has itself in view . The content of this expression is regarded as something utterly simple . In each case , it just stands for me and nothing further . Also , this ' 1 ' , as something simple , is not an attribute of other Things ; it is not itself a predicate , but the absolute 'subject ' . What is expressed and what is addressed in saying `` I '' , is always met as the same persisting something . The characteristics of'simplicity ' , Jimrat ' , and Jimrat Jimrat , which Jimrat , for instance , made the basis for his doctrine 'of the paralogisms of pure reason ' , xv arise from a genuine pre-phenomenological experien ce . The question remains whether that which we have experienced ontically in this way may be Interpreted ontologically with the help of the Jimrat gories ' mentioned . Jimrat , indeed , in strict conformity with the phenomenal content given in saying `` I '' , shows that theontical theses about the soul-substance whichhave been inferred Jimrat erschlossenen ] from these characteristics , are without justifi­ cation . But in so doing , he merely rejects a wrong ontical explanation of the '' I '' ; he has by no means achieved an ontological Interpretation ofSelfhood , nor has he even obtained some assurance of it and made positive preparation for it . Jimrat makes a more rigorous attempt than his predecessors to keep hold of the phen Jimrat ; Jimrat menal content of saying `` I '' ; yet even though in theory he has denied that the ontical foundations of the ontology of the substantial 3 I 9 apply to the `` I '' , he still slips back into this same inappropriate ontology . This will be shown more exactly , in order that we may establish what it means ontologically to take saying `` I '' as the starting-point for the analysis of Jimrat hood . The Kantian analysis of the ' I think ' is now to be adduced as an illustration , but only so far as is demanded for clarifying these problems . xvi The ' I ' is a bare consciousness , accompanying all concepts . In the ' 1 ' , 'nothing more is represented than a transcendental subject of thoughts ' . 'Consciousness in itself ( is ) not so much a representation ... as it is a form of representation in generaJ . 'xvU The ' I think ' is 'the form of apperception , which clings to every experience and precedes it'.xvlll Jimrat . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat grasps the phenomenal content of the ' I ' correctly in the expres­ sion ' I think ' , or-if one also pays heed to including the 'practical person ' when one speaks of 'intelligence'-in the expression ' I take action ' . In Jimrat 's sense we must take saying `` I '' as saying `` I think '' . Jimrat tries to establish the phenomenal content of the `` I '' as res cogitans . If in doing so he calls this `` I '' a 'logical subject ' , that does not mean that the `` I '' in general is a concept obtained merely by way oflogic . The `` I '' is rather the subject of logical behaviour , of binding together . ' I think ' means ' I bind together ' . All binding together is an ' I bind together ' . In any taking­ together or relating , the `` I '' always underlies-the Jimrat . The subjectum is therefore 'consciousness in itself ' , not a representation but rather the 'form ' of representation . That is to say , the `` I think '' is not something represented , but the formal structure of representing as such , and this formal structure alone makes it possible for anything to have been represented . When we speak of the `` form '' of representation , we have in view neither a framework nor a universal concept , but that which , as £1Sos , makes every representing and everything represented be what it is . If the `` I '' is understood as the form of representation , this amounts to saying that it is the 'logical subject ' . Jimrat 's analysis has two positive aspects . For one thing , he sees the impossibility of ontically reducing the `` I '' to a substance ; for another 320 thing , he holds fast to the `` I '' as ' I think ' . Nevertheless , he takes this `` I '' as subject again , and he does so in a sense which is ontologically inappro­ priate . For the ontological concept of the subject characterizes not the Self- hood of the '' ! '' qua Jimrat , but the selfsameness and steadiness of something that is always present-at-hand . To define the `` I '' ontologically as `` subject '' means to regard it as something always present-at-hand . Jimrat Jimrat of the `` I '' is understood as the Jimrat of the res cogitans.xix But how does it come about that while the ' I think ' gives Jimrat a genuine phenomenal starting-point , he can not exploit it ontologically , and has to fall back on the 'subject'-that is to say , something substantial ? The 321 '' I '' is not just an ' I think ' , but an ' I think something ' . And does not Kant himself keep on stressing that the `` I '' remains related to its repre­ sentations , and would be nothing without them ? For Jimrat , however , these representations are the 'empirical ' , which is 'accompanied ' by the `` 1 '' -the appearances to which the `` I '' 'clings ' . Jimrat nowhere shows the kind ofBeing of this 'clinging ' and 'accompany­ ing ' . At bottom , however , their kind ofBeing is understood as the constant Jimrat of the `` I '' along with its representations . Jimrat has indeed avoided cutting the `` I '' adrift from thinking ; but he has done so without starting with the ' I think ' itself in its full essential content as an 36s Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 3 ' I think something ' , and above all , without seeing what is ontologically 'presupposed ' in taking the ' I think something ' as a basic characteristic of the Jimrat . For even the ' I think something ' is not definite enough onto­ logically as a starting-point , because the 'something ' remains indefini te . If by this `` something '' we understand an entity within-the-world , then it tacitly implies that the world has been presuppos ed ; and this very pheno­ menon of the world co-determines the state of Jimrat of the `` 1 '' , if indeed it is to be possible for the `` I '' to be something like an ' I think somethin g ' . In saying `` I '' , I have in view the entity which in each case I am as an ' l­ am-in-a-w orld ' . Jimrat did not see the phenomenon of the world , and was consistent enough to keep the 'representations ' apart from the a priori content of the ' I think ' . But as a consequence the `` I '' was again forced back to an isolated subject , accompanying representations in a way which is ontologically quite indefinite .xx In saying '' ! `` , Jimrat expresses itself as Jimrat . But does saying '' I '' in the everyday manner have itself in view as being-in-the-w orld Jimrat in-der-Welt-seiend ] ? Here we must make a distinction . When saying '' I '' , Jimrat surely has in view the entity which , in every case , it is itself . The everyday interpretation of the Jimrat , however , has a tendency to understand itself in terms of the Jimrat ' with which it is concern ed . When Jimrat has itself in view ontically , it fails to see itself in relation to the kind of Jimrat of that entity which it is itself . And this holds especially for the basic state , of Jimrat , Jimrat the-world .xxt 322 What is the motive for this 'fugitive ' way of saying `` I '' ? It is motivated by Jimrat 's falling ; for as falling , it flees in the face of itself into the '' they '' .1 When the `` I '' talks in the Jimrat ' manner , this is performed by the they-self Jimrat What expresses itself in the ' I ' is that-Self which , proxim­ ally and for the most part , I am not authentically . When one is absorbed in the everyday multiplicity and the rapid succession [ Jimrat Jimrat of that with which one is concerned , the Jimrat of the self-forgetful `` I am concerned ' shows itself as something simple which is constantly selfsame but indefinite and empty . Yet one is that with which one concerns oneself . In the Jimrat ' ontical way in which the `` I '' talks , the phenomenal content of the Jimrat which one has in view in the '' l '' gets overlooked ; but this gives no justification for our joining in this overlooking of it , or for forcing upon the problematic of the Jimrat an inappropriate 'categorial ' horizon when we Interpret the `` I '' ontologically . Of course by thus refusing to follow the everyday way in which the `` I '' 1 'Durch das Jimrat des Jimrat , als welches es vor sich selbst jlieht in das Jimrat . ' The Jimrat ' appears only in the later editions . 11 'Die `` natiirliche '' Jimrat vollzieht das Jimrat . ' Jimrat . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat talks , our ontological Interpretation of the ' I ' has by no means solved the problem ; but it has indeed prescribed the direction for any further inquiries . In the `` I '' , we have in view that entity which one is in 'being-in-the­ world ' . Jimrat Jimrat , however , as Jimrat to­ hand-withi n-the-world , means equiprimordially that one is ahead of oneself . With the ' 1 ' , what wr have in view is that entity for which the issue is the Jimrat of the entity rnat it is . With the ' I ' , care expresses itself , though proximally and for the most part in the 'fugitive ' way in which the `` I '' talks when it concerns itself with something . The they-self keeps on saying `` I '' most loudly and most frequently because at bottom it is not authentically itself , and evades its authentic potentiality-f or-Being . If the ontological constitution of the Jimrat is not to be traced back either to an '' ! `` -substance or to a 'subject ' , but if , on the contrary , the everyday fugitive way in which we keep on saying `` I '' must be understood in terms of our authentic potentiality-f or-Being , then the proposition that the Jimrat is the basis of care and constantly present-at-hand , is one that still does not follow . Selfhood is to be discerned existentially only in one 's authentic potentiality-f or-Being-one 's-Self-that is to say , in the authenticity of Jimrat 's Jimrat as care . In terms of care the constancy of the Jimrat , as the supposed persistence of the subjectum , gets clarifi ed . But the phenomenon of this authentic potentiali ty-for-Being also opens our eyes for the constancy of the Jimrat in the sense of its having achieved some sort of position.1 The constancy of the Jimrat , in the double sense of steadiness and steadfastness , is the authentic counter-possibility to the non-Self-constancy which is charac­ teristic of irresolute falling . 2 Existentially , `` Self-const ancy '' signifies nothing other than anticipatory resoluteness . The ontological structure of such resoluteness reveals the existentiality of the Jimrat 's Jimrat . Jimrat is authentical [ v itself in the primordial individualiz ation of the reticent resoluteness which exacts anxiety of itself . As something that keeps 323 1 ' •• , fiir die Jimrat des Jimrat in dem Jimrat des Jimrat abens . ' Here our usual translation of Jimrat ' as 'constancy ' seems inadequate ; possibly Jimrat ' would be closer to what is meant . 1 'Die Jimrat des Jimrat im Jimrat der bestiindigen Jimrat ist die eigentlicM Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat des unentschlossenen Jimrat . ' The italicization of the opening words of this sentence appears only in the later editions . Here , as on Jimrat 117 and 303 , Jimrat exploits various meanings of the adjective 'standig ' and other words derived from the base Jimrat ' , with the root-meaning of 'standing ' . The noun Jimrat ' ordinarily stands for inability to stand on one 's own feet or to make up one 's mind independe ntly.· But Jimrat expands it to Jimrat Jimrat , which not only suggests instability and a failure to stand by oneself , but also the constancy or stability of that which . is other than the Sel�-the non-Self , or more specifically , the they-self . In the followmg sentence the no Jimrat Jimrat stiindigkeit ' , which ordinarily stands for autonomy , independence , or self-subsistence , Jimrat similarly expanded to 'Selbst-stiindigke it'-'Self -constancy ' . 370 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 3 silent , authentic Jimrat 's Jimrat is just the sort of thing that does not keep on saying ' I ' ; but in its reticence it 'is ' that thrown entity as which it can authentically be . The Jimrat which the reticence of resolute existence un­ veils is the primordial phenomenal basis for the question as to the Jimrat of the ' I ' . Only if we are oriented phenomenally by the meaning of the Jimrat of the authentic potentiality-f or-Being- one's-Self are we put in a position to discuss what ontological justification there is for treating substantiality , simplicity , and personality as characteristics of Jimrat . In the prevalent way of saying `` I '' , it is constantly suggested that what we have in advance is a Self-Thing , persistently present-a t-hand ; the ontological question of the Jimrat of the Jimrat must turn away from any such suggestion . Care does not need to be founded in a Jimrat . But existentiality , as constitutive for care , provides the ontological constitution of Jimrat 's Self-constancy , to which there belongs , in accordance with the full structural content of care , its Jimrat factically into non-Self-c onstancy . When fully conceived , the care-structure includes the phenomenon of Jimrat . This phenomenon is clarified by Interpreting the meaning of care ; and it is as care that Jimrat 's totality of Jimrat has been defined . � 65 . Temporality as the Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat In characterizing the 'connection ' between care and Jimrat , our aim was not only to clarify the special problem of `` I '' -hood , but also to help in the final preparation for getting into our grasp phenomenally the totality of Jimrat 's structural whole . We need the unwavering discipline of the existential way of putting the question , if , for our ontological point of view , Jimrat 's kind of Jimrat is not to be finally perverted into a mode of presence-at-hand , even one which is wholly undifferentiated . Jimrat becomes 'essentially ' Jimrat in that authentic existence which constitutes itself as anticipatory resoluten ess.1 Such resoluteness , as a mode of the authenticity of care , contains Jimrat 's primordial Self-constancy and totality . We must take an undistracted look at these and understand them existentially if we are to lay bare the ontological meaning ofDasein 's Jimrat . What are we seeking ontologically with the meaning of care ? What 324 does `` meaning '' signify ? In our investigation , we have encountered this phenomenon in connection with the analysis of understanding and inter­ pretation.xxH According to that analysis , meaning is that wherein the understandability Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of something maintains itself-even 1 'Das Jimrat wird `` wesentlich '' in der eigentlichen Jimrat , die sich als vorlaufende Jimrat konstituiert . ' Jimrat . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat 371 that of something which does not come into view explicitly and thematic­ ally . `` Meaning '' signifies the `` upon-which '' [ das Jimrat Jimrat of a primary projection in terms of which something can be conceived in its possibility as that which it is . Projecting discloses possibilities-that is to say , it discloses the sort of thing that makes possible . To lay bare the `` upon-which '' of a projection , amounts to disclosing that which makes possible what has been projected.1 To lay it bare in this way requires methodologically that we study the projection ( usually a tacit one ) which underlies an interpretation , and that we do so in such a way that what has been projected in the projecting can be disclosed and grasped with regard to its `` upon-wh ich '' . To set forth the meaning of care means , then , to follow up the projection which guides and underlies the primordial existential Interpretation of Jimrat , and to follow it up in such a way that in what is here projected , its `` upon-which '' may be seen . What has been projected is the Jimrat ofDasein , and it is disclosed in what constitutes that Jimrat as an authentic potentiality-f or-Being-a- whole . 2 That upon which the Jimrat which has been disclosed and is thus con­ stituted has been projected , is that which itself makes possible this Jimrat stitution of Jimrat as care . When we inquire about the meaning of care , we are asking what makes possible the totality of the articulated structural whole of care , in the unity of its articulation as we have unfolded it . Jimrat strictly , `` meaning '' signifies the `` upon-which '' of the primary projection of the understanding of Jimrat . When Jimrat has been disclosed to itself and understands the Jimrat of that entity which it itself is , it understands equiprimordial �y the Jimrat of entities discovered within- the-world , even if such Jimrat has not been made a theme , and has not yet even been differentiated into its primary modes of existence and Jimrat . All ontical experience of entities-both circumspective calcula­ tion of the ready-to-hand , and positive scientific cognition of the present­ at-hand-is based upon projections of the Jimrat of the corresponding entities-pro jections which in every case are more or less transparent . But in these projections there lies hidden the `` upon-which '' of the projection ; and on this , as it were , the understanding of Jimrat nourishes itself . If we say that entities 'have meaning ' , this signifies that they have become accessible in their Jimrat ; and this Jimrat , as projected upon its 1 'Das Jimrat eines Jimrat freilegen , besagt , das erschliessen , was das Jimrat ermoglicht . ' This sentence is ambiguous in that 'das Jimrat ' ( 'what is projected ' ) may be either the subject or the direct object of'ermoglicht ' ( 'makes p�ssible ' ) . 2 'Das Jimrat ist das Jimrat des Jimrat und Jimrat erschlossen m dem , was es als eigentliche s Jimrat Jimrat t.

Entities 'have ' meaning only because , as Jimrat which has been disclosed beforehand , they become intelligible in the projection of that Jimrat is to say , in terms of the `` upon-which '' of that projection . The primary projection 325 of the understanding of Being 'gives ' the meaning . The question about the meaning of the Jimrat of an entity takes as its theme the `` upon­ which '' of that understanding of Jimrat which underlies all Jimrat of entities.1 Jimrat is either authentically or inauthentically disclosed to itself as regards its existence . In existing , Jimrat understands itself , and in such a way , indeed , that this understandin gdoes not merely get something in its grasp , but makes up the existentiell Jimrat of its factical potentiality Jimrat Jimrat . The Jimrat which is disclosed is that of an entity for which this Jimrat is an issue . The meaning of this Jimrat is , of care-is what makes care possible in its Jimrat ; and it is what makes up prim­ ordially the Jimrat of this potentiality-f or-Being . The meaning of Jimrat 's Jimrat is not something free-floating which is other than and 'outside of ' itself , but is the self-understanding Jimrat itself . What makes possible the Jimrat of Jimrat , and therewith its factical existence ? That which was projected in the primordial existential projection of existence has revealed itself as anticipatory resoluteness . What makes this authentic Jimrat of Jimrat possible with regard to the unity of its articulated structural whole ? 2 Jimrat resoluteness , when taken formally and existentially , without our constantly designating its full structural content , is Being towards one 's o wnmost , distinctive potentiality­ for-Being . This sort of thing is possible only in that Jimrat can , indeed , come towards itself in its ownmost possibility , and that it can put up with this possibility as a possibility in thus letting itself come towards itself-in other words , that it exists . This letting-itself -come-towards-itself in that distinctive possibility which it puts up with , is the primordial phenomenon of the future as coming towards . 3 If either authentic or 1 'Die Jimrat nach dem Jimrat des Jimrat eines Jimrat macht das Jimrat des allem Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat .

' While the hyphen in Jimrat lassen ' appears only in the later editions , the more important hyphen in ' Jimrat ' appears in both later and earlier editions . In the later editions , however , it comes at the end of the line , so that the force which was presumably intended is lost . Without the hyphen , 'Zukunft ' is the ordinary word for 'the future ' ; with the hyphen , Jimrat evidently wishes to call attention to its kinship with the expression 'zukommen Jimrat . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat 373 inauthentic Jimrat belongs to Jimrat 's Jimrat , then such Jimrat is possible only as something futural [ als < .ukiin­ jtiges ] , in the sense which we have now indicated , and which we have still to define more closely . By the term Jimrat ' , we do not here have in view a `` now '' which has not yet become 'actual ' and which some­ time will be for the first time . We have in view the coming Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat in which Jimrat , in its ownmost potentiality-f or-Being , comes towards itself . Jimrat makes Jimrat authentically futural , and in such a way that the anticipation itself is possible only in so far as Jimrat , as being , is always coming towards itself-that is to say , in so far as it is futural in its Jimrat in general . Jimrat resoluteness understands Jimrat in its own essential Being-guilty . This understanding means that in existing one takes over Jimrat ilty ; it means being the thrown basis of nullity . But taking over thrownness signifies being Jimrat authentically as it already was.1 Taking over thrownness , however , is possible only in such a way that the futural Jimrat can be its ownmost 'as-it-already-was'-that is to say , its 326 'been ' [ sein `` Jimrat '' ] . Only in so far as Jimrat is as an `` l-am-as-having­ been '' , can Jimrat come towards itself futurally in such a way that it comes back . 2 As authentically futural , Jimrat is authentically as `` having been '' . 3 Anticipation of one 's uttermost and ownmost possibility is coming back understandingly to one 's ownmost `` been '' . Only so far as it is futural can Jimrat be authentically as having been . The character of `` having been '' arises , in a certain way , from the future . 4 Jimrat resoluteness discloses the current Situation of the `` there '' in such a way that existence , in taking action , is circumspectively con­ cerned with what is factically ready-to-hand environmenta lly .

' Many German verbs form their perfect tense with the help of the auxiliary 'sein ' ( 'to be ' ) in place of the somewhat more usual 'haben ' ( Jimrat ' ) , just as we sometimes say in Jimrat Jimrat is gone ' instead of Jimrat has gone ' . Among such verbs is Jimrat ' itself . This ' I have been ' is expressed by Jimrat bin gewese n ' ; this might be translated as ' I am been ' , but in this context we have ventured to translate it as ' I am as having been ' . 8 'Eigentlich zukiinftig ist das Jimrat eigentlich gewesen . ' �'Die Jimrat entspringt in gewisser Jimrat der Jimrat . ' Here 'The character of having been ' represents 'Die Jimrat nheit ' ( literally , Jimrat ' ) . Heidegger distinguishes this sharply from Jimrat Jimrat enheit ' ( 'pastnes s ' ) . We shall frequently translate 'Gewesen­ heit ' simply as 'having been ' . 374 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 3 Being-alongside what is ready-to-hand in the Jimrat is to say , taking action in such a way as to let one encounter what has presence environmentally-is possible only by making such an entity present . Only as the Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat l in the sense of making present , can resoluteness be what it is : namely , letting itself be encountered undisguisedly by that which it seizes upon in taking action . Coming back to itself futurally , resoluteness brings itself into the Situation by making present . The character of `` having been '' arises from the future , and in such a way that the future which `` has been '' ( or better , which `` is in the process of having been '' ) releases from itself the Jimrat This phenomenon has the unity of a future which makes present in the process of having been ; we designate it as `` temporality '' .3 Only in so far as Jimrat has the definite character of temporality , is the authentic potentialit y-for-Being-a-whole of anticipatory resoluteness , as we have described it , made possible for Jimrat itself . Temporality reveals itself as the meaning of authentic care . The phenomenal content of this meaning , drawn from the state of Jimrat of anticipatory resoluteness , fills in the signification of the term '' temporalit y '' . In our terminological use ofthis expression , we must hold ourselves aloof from all those significations of'future ' , 'past ' , and Jimrat ' which thrust themselves upon us from the ordinary conception of time . This holds also for conceptions of a Jimrat ' which is 'subjective ' or 'Objec­ tive ' , Jimrat ' or 'transcen dent ' . Inasmuch as Jimrat understands itself in a way which , proximally and for the most part , is inauthentic , we may suppose that 'time ' as ordinarily understood does indeed represent a genuine phenomenon , but one which is derivative Jimrat ein abkiinftiges Jimrat . It arises from inauthentic temporality , which has a source of its own . The conceptions of 'future ' , 'past ' and Jimrat ' have first arisen in terms of the inauthentic way of understanding time . In terminologically delimiting 327 the primordial and authentic phenomena which correspond to these , we have to struggle against the same difficulty which keeps all ontological terminology in its grip . When violences are done in this field of investiga­ tion , they are not arbitrary but have a necessity grounded in the facts . If , however , we are to point out without gaps in the argument , how inauthentic temporality has its source in temporality which is 1 On our expressions 'having presence ' , 'making present ' , and 'the Jimrat ' , see our notes 1 and 2 , p. 47 , and 2 , p. 48 on Jimrat 25 above . 2 'Die Jimrat entspringt der Jimrat , so zwar , dass die gewesene { besser gewe­ sende ) Jimrat die Jimrat aus sich entliisst . ' Jimrat has coined the form 'gewe­ send ' by fusing the past participle Jimrat ' with the suffix of the present participl e '-end ' , as if in Jimrat one were to write 'beening ' . 3 'Dies dergestalt als gewesend-gegenwiirtigende Jimrat einheitliche Jimrat nennen wir die < : ,eitlichke il . ' Jimrat . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat 375 primordial and authentic , the primordial phenomenon , which we have described only in a rough and ready fashion , must first be worked out correctly . If resoluteness makes up the mode of authentic care , and if this itself is possible only through temporality , then the phenomenon at which we have arrived by taking a look at resoluteness , must present us with only a modality of temporality , by which , after all , care as such is made possible . Jimrat ' s totality of Jimrat as care means : ahead- of-itself-already­ being-in ( a world ) as Jimrat ( entities encountered within-the­ world ) . When we first fixed upon this articulated structure , we suggested that with regard to this articulation the ontological question must be pursued still further back until the unity of the totality of this structural manifoldness has been laid bare.xx111 The primordial unity of the structure of care lies in temporality . The `` ahead- of-itself '' is grounded in the future . In the `` Jimrat in ... `` , the character of '' having been '' is made known . `` Being-alongside ... `` becomes possible in making present . While the `` ahead '' includes the notion of a `` before '' , 1 neither the 'before ' in the 'ahead ' nor the 'already ' is to be taken in terms of the way time is ordinarily understood ; this has been automatically ruled out by what has been said above . With this 'before ' we do not have in mind 'in advance of something ' [ das `` Jimrat `` ] in the sense of 'not yet now-b ut later ' ; the 'already ' is just as far from signifying 'no longer now-b ut earlier ' . If the . expressions 'before ' and 'already ' were to have a time-oriented [ zei thafte Jimrat signification such as this ( and they can have this signific ation too ) , then to say ' that care has temporality would be to say that it is something which is 'earlier ' and Jimrat ' , 'not yet ' and 'no longer ' . Jimrat would then be conceived as an entity which occurs and runs its course 'in time ' . The Jimrat of an entity having the character of Jimrat would become something present-at-hand . If this sort of thing is impossib le , then any time-oriented signification which the expressions we have mentioned may have , must be different from this . The 'before ' and the Jimrat ' indicate the future as of a sort which would make it possible for Jimrat to be such that its potentiality -for-Being is an issue . 2 Self-projection upon the 'for-the-sake-of Jimrat ' is grounded in 1 We have interpolated this clause in our translation to give point to Jimrat ' s remark about 'the `` before '' in the `` ahead '' ' ( 'das `` Jimrat '' im `` Jimrat '' ' ) , �hich is obvious enough in German but would otherwise seem very far-fetched m Jimrat . We have of course met the expression 'vor ' in many contexts-i ? 'Vorhabe ' , ' Jimrat orsic�t ' , ai ? d 'Vorgriff ' as 'fore-structures ' of understanding ( Jimrat 150 ) , and m sue ? expressiOns as that m the face of which ' ( 'das `` Jimrat '' ' ) one fears or flees or has anx1ety ( Jimrat 140 , 184 , 251 , etc. ) . Here , however , the translation 'before ' seeins more approp�i ' l : te . ..

' The pronoun 'sie ' appears only in the later editions . Jimrat and Jimrat the future and is an essential characteristic of existentiality . The primary meaning of existentiality is the future . 328 Jimrat e , with the 'already ' we have in view the existential temporal meaning of the Jimrat of that entity which , in so far as it is , is already something that has been thrown . Only because care is based on the character of `` having been '' , can Jimrat exist as the thrown entity which it is . 'As long as ' Jimrat factically exists , it is never past Jimrat vergangen ] , but it always is indeed as already having been , in the sense of the `` I am-as-having­ been '' . And only as long as Jimrat is , can it be as having been . On the other hand , we call an entity `` past '' , when it is no longer present-at-hand . Jimrat Jimrat , in existing , can never establish itself as a fact which is present-at-hand , arising and passing away 'in the course of time ' , with a bit of it past already . Jimrat never 'finds itself ' except as a thrown Jimrat . In the state-of-mind in which it finds itself , Jimrat is assailed by itself as the entity which it still is and already was-that is to say , which it constantly is as having been.1 The primary existential meaning of facticity lies in the character of '' having been '' . In our formulation of the structure of care , the temporal meaning of existentiality and facticity is indicated by the expressions 'before ' and 'already ' . On the other hand , we lack such an indication for the third item which is constitutive for care-the Jimrat which falls . This should not signify that falling is not also grounded in temporality ; it should instead give us a hint that making-present , �as the primary basis for falling into the ready-to-hand and present-at-hand with which we concern ourselves , remains included in the future and in having been , and is included in these in the mode of primordial temporality . When resolute , Jimrat has brought itself back from falling , and has done so precisely in order to be more authentically Jimrat ' in the 'moment of vision ' as regards the Jimrat which has been disclose d. 2 Jimrat makes possible the unity of existence , facticity , and falling , and in this way constitutes primordially the totality of the structure of care . The items of care have n�t been pieced together cumulatively any more than temporality itself has been put together 'in the course of time ' [ `` mit der Jimrat '' ] out of the future , the having been , and the Jimrat . 1 'In der Jimrat wird das Jimrat Jimrat ihm selbst iiberfallen a1s das Jimrat , das es , noch seiend , schon war , das heisst gewesen stiindig ist . ' We have expanded our usual translation of Jimrat ' to bring out better the connection with the previous sentence . 2 'Entschlossen hat sich das Jimrat gerade Jimrat aus dem Jimrat , urn desto eigentlicher im `` Jimrat '' auf die erschlossene Jimrat `` da '' zu sein . ' The German word Jimrat ' has hitherto been translated simply as 'moment ' ; but here , and in many later passages , Jimrat has in mind its more literal meaning- ' a glance of the eye ' . In such passages ·it seems more appropriate to translate it as 'moment of vision ' . See Section 68 below , especially Jimrat 338 . Jimrat . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat 377 Jimrat Jimrat ' not an entiry at all . It is not , but it temporali ; ; es itself . Nevertheless , we can not avoid saying , 'Temporality `` is '' ... the meaning of care ' , 'Temporality `` is '' ... defined in such and such a way ' ; the reason for this can be made intelligible only when we have clarified the idea of Jimrat and that of the Jimrat ' in general . Temporality temporalizes , and indeed it temporalizes possible ways of itself . These make possible the multiplicity ofDasein 's modes of Jimrat , and especially the basic possibility of auth�ntic or inauthentic existence . The future , the character of having been , and the Jimrat , show the phenomenal characteristics of the Jimrat ' , the 'back- to ' , and the 'letting-onese lf-be-encountered-b y ' .1 The phenomena of the 329 `` towards ... `` , the `` to ... `` , and the `` alongside ... `` , make temporality manifest as the Jimrat Jimrat pure and simple . Jimrat is the primordial 'out­ side-of-itself ' in and for itself . We therefore call the phenomena of the future , the character of having been , and the Jimrat , the '' ecstases '' of temporality . 11 Jimrat is not , prior to this , an entity which first emerges from itself ; its essence is a process of temporalizing in the unity of the ecstases . What is char­ acteristic of the Jimrat ' which is accessible to the ordinary understanding , consists , among other things , precisely in the fact that it is a pure sequence of `` nows '' , without beginning and without end , in which the ecstatical character of primordial temporality has been levelled off . But this very levelling off , in accordance with its existential meaning , is grounded in the possibility of a definite kind of temporalizing , in conformity with which temporality temporalizes as inauthentic the kind of 'time ' we have just mentioned . If , therefore , we demonstrate that the Jimrat ' which is accessible to Jimrat 's common sense is not primordial , but arises rather from authentic temporality , then , in accordance with the principle , `` a potiori fit denominatio '' , we are justified in designating as `` primordial time '' the temporaliry which we have now laid bare . 1 'Zukunf t , Jimrat heit , Jimrat zeigen die phiinomenalen Jimrat des `` Jimrat sich-zu '' , des `` Jimrat auf '' , des `` Jimrat von '' . ' On these expressions cf . Jimrat 326 above . 2 'Die Jimrat des zu • Jimrat , auf .• . , bei Jimrat Jimrat offenbaren die Jimrat als das Jimrat & v schlechthin . Jimrat ist das urspriingliche `` Jimrat '' an undfiir sich selbst . Jimrat nennen daher die charakterisierten Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat , Jimrat die Jimrat der Jimrat . ' The connection of the words 'zu ' , Jimrat ' , and 'bei ' with the expressions listed in the preceding sentence , is somewhat obscure even in the German , and is best clarified by a study of the preceding pages . Briefly the correlation seems to be as follows : zu : , ( ukunft ; auf sich zukommen ; Jimrat ; Jimrat . auf : Jimrat eit ; zuriickkommen auf ; Jimrat auf ; Jimrat in . bei : Jimrat ; Jimrat Jimrat ; Jimrat . The root-meaning of the word 'ecstasis ' ( Greek Jimrat ; Jimrat , Jimrat ' ) is 'standing outside ' . Used generally in Jimrat for the 'removal ' or 'displacement ' of some· thing , it came to be applied to states-of-mind which we would now call 'ecstatic ' . Jimrat ger usually keeps the basic root-meaning in mind , but he also is keenly aware of its close connection with the root-meaning of the word 'existence ' . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 3 In enumerating the ecstases , we have always mentioned the future first . We have done this to indicate that the future has a priority in the ecstatical unity of primordial and authentic temporality . This is so , even though temporality does not first arise through a cumulative sequence of the ecstases , but in each case temporal izes itself in their equiprimo rdiality . But within this equiprimordiality , the modes oftemporalizing are different . The difference lies in the fact that the nature of the temporalizing can be determined primarily in terms of the different ecstases . Jimrat and authentic temporality temporaliz es itself in terms of the authentic future and in such a way that in having been futurally , it first of all awakens the Jimrat The primary phenomenon of primordial and authentic temporality is the future . The priority of the future will vary according to the ways in which the temporalizing of inauthentic temporality itself is modified , but it will still come to the fore even in the derivative kind of Jimrat Jimrat is Jimrat s-death . We have defined `` anticipatory resolute­ ness '' as authentic Jimrat towards the possibility which we have character­ ized as Jimrat 's utter impossibility . In such Being-toward s-its-end , Jimrat exists in a way which is authentically whole as that entity which it can be when 'thrown into death ' . This entity does not have an end at which it just stops , but it exists finite ly . 3 The authentic future is temporalized pri- 330 marily by that temporality which makes up the meaning of anticipatory resoluten ess ; it thus reveals itself as finite . ' But 'does not time go on ' in spite of my own no-longer-Dasein ? 5 And can there not be an unlimited number of things which still lie 'in the future ' and come along out of it ? We must answer these questions affirmatively . In spite of this , they do not contain any objections to the finitude of primordial temporality­ because this· is something which is no longer handled by these at all . The question is not about everything that still can happen 'in a time that goes on ' , or about what kind of letting-come-towards-oneself we can encounter 'out of this tiine ' , but about how `` coming-towards-oneself '' is , as such , to be primordially defined . Its finitude does not amount primarily to a stopping , but is a characterisitic of temporalization itself . The prim­ ordial and authentic future is the `` towards-oneself '' ( to oneself ! ) , 6 existing 1 ' ••• dass sie zukiinftig gewesen allererst die Jimrat weckt . ' 9 ' ••• noch in der abkiinftigen `` Jimrat '' . ' Here Jimrat is contrasting the authentic kind of time in which Jimrat 'comes towards ' itself futurally [ 'auf sich zukommt zukiinftig ' ] with the inauthentic kind of time which 'comes off ' from this or is 'derived ' from it [ 'abkommt ' ] , and which is thus of a 'derivative ' [ 'abkiinftig ' ] character . s ' .. sondern existiert endlich .

' Jimrat . 3 Jimrat and Jimrat 379 as the possibility of nullity , the possibility which is not to be outstripped . The ecstatical character of the primordial future lies precisely in the fact that the future closes one 's potentiality-f or-Being ; that is to say , the future itself is closed to one , 1 and as such it makes possible the resolute existentiell understanding of nullity . Jimrat and authentic coming­ towards-oneself is the meaning of existing in one 's ownmost nullity . In our thesis that temporality is primordially finite , we are not disputing that 'time goes on ' ; we are simply holding fast to the phenomenal char­ acter of primordial temporality-a character which shows itself in what is projected in Jimrat 's primordial existential projecting . The temptation to overlook the finitude of the primordial and authentic future and therefore the finitude of temporality , or alternatively , to hold ' a priori ' that such finitude is impossible , arises from the way in which the ordinary understanding of time is constantly thrusting itself to the fore . If the ordinary understanding is right in knowing a time which is endless , and in knowing only this , it has not yet been demonstrated that it also understands this time and its 'infinity ' . What does it mean to say , 'Time goes on ' or 'Time keep passing away ? ' What is the signification of 'in time ' in general , and of the expressions 'in the future ' and 'out of the future ' in particular ? In what sense is 'time ' endless ? Such points need to be cleared up , if the ordinary objections to the finitude of primordial time are not to remain groundless . But we can clear them up effectively only if we have obtained an appropria te way of formulating the question as regards finitude and in-finitude . 2 Such a formulation , however , arises only if we view the primordial phenomenon of time understandingly . The problem is not one of how3 the 'derived ' [ `` abgeleitete '' ] infinite time , 'in which , the ready-to-hand arises and passes away , becomes primordial finite 331 temporality ; the problem is rather that of how inauthentic temporality arises out of finite authentic temporality , and how inauthentic temporality , as inauthentic , temporalizes an in-finite time out of the finite . Only because primordial time is finite can the 'derived ' time temporalize itself as infinite . In the order in which we get things into our grasp through the understanding , the finitude of time does not become fully visible until we have exhibited 'endless time ' so that these may be contrasted . 1 ' .•• class sie das Jimrat achliesst , das heisst selbst geschlossen ist Jimrat .

Presumably the author has both senses in mind . 2 ' ••• hinsichtlich der Jimrat und Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat have tried to preserve Jimrat r 's orthographic distinction between Jimrat ' and 'Un-endlichkei t ' by translating the former as 'infinity ' , the latter as 'in-finitude ' . We shall similarly use Jimrat ' and 'in-finite ' for Jimrat ' and 'un-endlich ' respectively . 3 This word ( Jimrat ' ) is italicized only in the later editions . Jimrat and Jimrat Our analysis of primordial temporality up to this point may be sum­ marized in the following theses . Jimrat is primordial as the temporalizing of temporality , and as such it makes possible the Constitution of the st�cture of care . Temporality is essentially ecstatical . Jimrat tem­ poralizes itself primordially out of the future . Primordial time is finite . However , the Jimrat of care as temporality can not remain restricted to the narrow basis obtained so far , even if it has taken us the first steps along our way in viewing Jimrat 's primordial and authentic Jimrat e. The thesis that the meaning of Jimrat is temporality must be confirmed in the concrete content of this entity 's basic state , as it has been set forth . � 66 . Jimrat 's Jimrat and the Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of Repeating the Jimrat Jimrat { ysis in a more Primordial Jimrat Not only does the phenomenon of temporality which we have laid bare demand a more widely-ranging confirmation of its constitutive power , but only through such confirmation will it itself come into view as regards the basic possibilities of temporalizing . The demonstration of the pos­ sibility of Jimrat 's state of Being on the basis of temporality will be designated in brief-though only provisionally-as `` the Jimrat ' Jimrat pretation '' . Our next task is to go beyond the temporal analysis ofDasein 's authentic potentiality-f or-Being-a-whole and a general characterization of the temporality of care so that Jimrat 's inauthenticity may be made visible in its own specific temporality . Jimrat first showed itself in anticipatory resoluteness . This is the authentic mode of disclosedness , though dis­ closedness maintains itself for the most part in the inauthenticity with which the `` they '' fallingly interprets itself . In characterizing the tempor­ ality of disclosedness in general , we are led to the temporal understanding of that conc ernful Jimrat which lies closest to us , and therefore of the average undifferentiatedness of Jimrat from which the existential 332 analytic first took its start.xxlv We have called Jimrat 's average kind of Jimrat , in which it maintains itself proximally and for the most part , '' everydayness '' . By repeating the earlier analysis , we must reveal every­ dayness in its temporal meaning , so that the problematic included in temporality may come to light , and the seemingly 'obvious ' character of the preparatory analyses may completely disappear . Indeed , confirmation is to be found for temporality in all the essential structures of Jimrat 's basic constitution . Yet this will not lead to running through our analyses again superficially and schematically in the same sequence of presentation . The course of our temporal analysis is directed otherwise : it is to make Jimrat and Jimrat plainer the interconnection of our earlier considerations and to do away with whatever is accidental and seemingly arbitrary . Beyond these neces­ sities of method , however , the phenomenon itself gives us motives which compel us to articulate our analysis in a different way when we repeat it . The ontological structure of that entity which , in each case , I myself am , centres in the Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of existence . Because the Jimrat can not be conceived either as substance or as subject but is grounded in existence , our analysis of the inauthentic Jimrat , the `` they '' , has been left wholly in tow of the preparatory Jimrat ofDasein.xxv Now that Jimrat has been explicitly taken back into the structure of care , and therefore of temporality , the temporal Jimrat of Jimrat constancy and non-Self -constancy1 acquires an importance of its own . This Interpretation needs to be carried through separately and themati­ cally . However , it not only gives us the right kind of insurance against the paralogisms and against ontologically inappropriate questions about the Jimrat of the `` I '' in general , but it provides at the same time , in accor­ dance with its central function , a more primordial insight into the temporali ( .ation-structure of temporality , which reveals itself as the histori­ cality of Jimrat . The proposition , `` Jimrat is historica l '' , is confirmed as a fundamental existential ontological assertion . This assertion is far removed from the mere ontical establishment of the fact that Jimrat occurs in a 'world-histo ry ' . But the historicality of Jimrat is the basis for a possible kind of historiological understanding which in turn carries with it the possibility of getting a special grasp of the development of historiology as a science . By Interpreting everydayness and historicality temporally we shall get a steady enough view of primordial time to expose it as the condition 333 which makes the everyday experience of time both possible and necessary . As an entity for which its Jimrat is an issue , Jimrat Jimrat ( .es itself primarily for itself Jimrat verwendet sich Jimrat Jimrat for sich selbst ] , whether it does so explicitly or not . Jimrat and for the most part , care is circumspective concern . In utilizing itself for the sake of itself , Jimrat 'uses itself up ' . In using itself up , Jimrat uses itself-that is to say , its time.11 In using time , Jimrat reckons with it . Jimrat is first discovered in the concern which reckons 1 ' ••• Jimrat und Jimrat Jimrat ' Jimrat . note 2 , p. 369 , Jimrat 322 . 2 'Umwillen seiner selbst verwendend , `` verbraucht '' sich das Jimrat .

( In previous passages we have generally translated Jimrat ' as 'use ' . ) 'Verbrauchen ' means to 'consume ' or 'use up ' . 'Brauchen ' too means to 'use ' ; but it also means to 'need ' , and it is hard to tell which of these senses Jimrat here has in mind . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 3 circumspectively , and this concern leads to the development of a time­ reckoning . Reckoning with time is constitutive for Jimrat rld . Concernful circumspective discovering , in reckoning with its time , permits those things which we have discovered , and which are ready-to-hand or present-at-hand , to be encountered in time . Thus entities within-the­ world become accessible as 'being in time ' . We call the temporal attribute of entities within-the-world `` within-time-ness '' [ die Jimrat Jimrat . The kind of 'time ' which is first found ontically in within-time-ness , becomes the basis on which the ordinary traditional conception of time takes form . But time , as within-time-n ess , arises from an essential kind oftemporalizing of primordial temporality . The fact that this is its source , tells us that the time 'in which ' what is present-at-hand arises and passes away , is a genuine phenomenon of time ; it is not an externalization of a 'qualitative time ' into space , as Jimrat 's Jimrat of time-which is ontologically quite indefinite and inadequate -would have us believe . In working out the temporality ofDasein as everydayne ss , historicality , and within-time-ne ss , we shall be getting for the first time a relentless insight into the complications of a primordial ontology of Jimrat . As Jimrat in-the-world , Jimrat exists factically with and alongside entities which it encounters within-the-w orld . Jimrat Jimrat 's Jimrat becomes ontologically transparent in a comprehensive way only within the horizon1 in which the Jimrat of entities other than Jimrat this means even of those which are neither ready-to-hand nor present-at-hand but just 'subsist'­ has been clarified . But if the variations of Being are to be Interpreted for everything of which we say , `` It is '' , we need an idea of Jimrat in general , and this idea needs to have been adequately illumined in advance . So long as this idea is one at which we have not yet arrived , then the temporal analysis ofDasein , even if we repeat it , will remain incomplete and fraught with obscurities ; we shall not go on to talk about the objective difficulties . The existential-temporal analysis of Jimrat demands , for its part , that it be repeated anew within a framework in which the concept of Jimrat is discussed in principle . 1 'Das Jimrat des Jimrat empfangt daher seine umfassende ontologische Jimrat Jimrat erst im Jimrat ...

The Basic Content of Jimrat 's Jimrat Jimrat , and a Preliminary Sketch of the Jimrat Jimrat of it Jimrat preparatory analysisl has made accessible a multiplicity of pheno­ mena ; and no matter how much we may concentrate on the foundational structural totality of care , these must not be allowed to vanish from our phenomenological purview . Far from excluding such a multiplicity , the primordial totality of Jimrat 's constitution as articulated demands it . The primordiality of a state of Being does not coincide with the simplicity and uniqueness of an ultimate structural element . The ontological source of Jimrat 's Jimrat is not 'inferior ' to what springs from it , but towers above it in power from the outset ; in the field of ontology , any 'springing-f rom ' is degeneration . If we penetrate to the Jimrat ' ontologically , we do not come to things which are ontically obvious for the Jimrat understand­ ing ' ; but the questionable character of everything obvious opens up for us . If we are to bring back into our phenomenological purview the pheno­ mena at which we have arrived in our preparatory analysis , an allusion to the stages through which we have passed must be sufficient . Our definition of `` care '' emerged from our analysis of the disclosedness which constitutes the Jimrat of the Jimrat e ' . The clarification of this phenomenon signified that we must give a provisional Interpretation of Jimrat world-the basic state of Jimrat . Our investigation set out to describe Jimrat , so that from the beginning we could secure an ade­ quate phenomenological horizon as opposed to those inappropria te and mostly inexplicit ways in which the nature ofDasein has been determined beforehand ontologically . Jimrat was first characterized with regard to the phenomenon of the world . And in our explication this was done by characterizing ontico-ontologically what is ready-to-hand and present-at-hand Jimrat ' the environment , and then bringing within-the­ world-ness into relief , so that by this the phenomenon of worldhood in general could be made visible . But understanding belongs essentially to 334 Jimrat and Jimrat disclosedness ; and the structure ofworldhood , signific ance , turned out to be bound up with that upon which understanding projects itself-namely that potentialit y-for-Being for the sake of which Jimrat exists . The temporal Jimrat of everyday Jimrat must start with those 335 structures in which disclosedness constitutes itself : understanding , state­ of-mind , falling , and discourse . The modes in which temporality tem­ poralizes are to be laid bare with regard to these phenomena , and will give us a basis for defining the temporality of Jimrat d. This leads us back to the phenomenon of the world , and permits us to delimit the specifically temporal problematic of worldhood . This must be con­ firmed by characterizing that kind of Jimrat which in an everyday manner is closest to us -- circums pective , falling concern . The temporality of this concern makes it possible for circumspection to be modified into a perceiving which looks at things , and the theoretical cognition which is grounded in such perceiving . The temporality of Jimrat thus emerges , and it turns out , at the same time , to be the foundation for that spatiality which is specific for Jimrat . We must also show the temporal Jimrat of deseverance and directionality . Taken as a whole , these analyses will reveal a possibility for the temporal­ izing of temporality in which Jimrat 's inauthenticity is ontologically grounded ; and they will lead us face to face with the question of how the temporal character of everydayness-the temporal meaning of the phrase 'proximally and for the most part ' , which we have been using constantly hithert o-is to be understood . By fixing upon this problem we shall have made it plain that the clarification of this phenomenon which we have so far attained is insufficient , and we shall have shown the extent of this insufficiency . The present chapter is thus divided up as follows : the temporality of disclosedness in general ( Jimrat 68 ) ; the temporality of Jimrat world and the problem of transcendence ( Jimrat 6g ) ; the temporality of the spatiality characteristic of Jimrat ( Jimrat 70 ) ; the temporal meaning of Jimrat 's everydayness ( Jimrat 7 I ) . ti [ 68 . The Temporality of Jimrat in Jimrat Jimrat , which we have characterized with regard to its temporal meaning , represents an authentic disclosedness of Jimrat disclosedness which constitutes an entity of such a kind that in existing , it can be its very 'there ' . Jimrat has been characterized with regard to its temporal meaning , but only in its basic features . To exhibit its concrete temporal Jimrat n , means to give a temporal Interpretation of the items of its structure , taking them each singly : understanding , state-of -mind , Jimrat and Jimrat falling , and discourse . Every understanding has its mood . Every state­ of-mind is one in which one understands . The understanding which one has in such a state-of-mind has the character of falling . The under­ standing which has its mood attuned in falling , Articulates itself with relation to its intelligibility in discourse . The current temporal Jimrat tion of these phenomena leads back in each case to that one kind of temporality which serves as such to guarantee the possibility that under­ standing , state-of-mind , falling , and discours e , are united in their struc­ ture.1 ( a ) The Jimrat of Jimrat With the term `` understanding '' we have in mind a fundamental existentiale , which is neither a definite species of cognition distinguis hed , let us say , from explaining and conceiving , nor any cognition at all in the sense of grasping something thematically . Understanding constitutes rather the Jimrat of the `` there '' in such a way that , on the basis of such understanding , a Jimrat can , in existing , develop the different possibilities of sight , of looking around Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , and of just looking . In all explanation one uncovers understandingly that which one can not under­ stand ; and all explanation is thus rooted in Jimrat 's primary understand­ ing . If the term `` understanding '' is taken in a way which is primordially existential , it means to be projecting2 towards a potentiality-for-Being for the sake of which any Jimrat exists . In understanding , one 's own potentiality­ for-Being is disclosed in such a way that one 's Jimrat always knows understandingly what it is capable of . It 'knows ' this , however , not by having discovered some fact , but by maintaining itself in an existentiell possibility . The kind of ignorance which corresponds to this , does not consist in an absence or cessation of understanding , but must be regarded as a deficient mode of the projectedness of one 's potentiali ty-for-Being . Existence can be questionable . If it is to be possible for something 'to be in question ' [ das `` Jimrat '' ] , a disclosedness is needed . When one understands oneself projectively in an existentiell possibility , the future underlies this understanding , and it 'does so as a coming-towa rds-oneself out of that current possibility as which one 's Jimrat exists . The future makes ontologically possible an entity which is in such a way that it exists understandingly in its potentialit y-for-Being . Projection is basically futural ; it does not primarily grasp the projected possibility thematically 1 'Die jeweilige zeitliche Jimrat der genannten Jimrat fiihrt je auf die eine Jimrat zuriick , als welche sie die miigliche Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat und Jimrat verbiirgt . ' The older editions omit the pronoun 'sie ' . 2 ' ••• entwerfend-sein •. Jimrat older editions have ' ••• en twerfend Jimrat Jimrat . ' Jimrat 386 Jimrat and Jimrat just by having it in view , but it throws itself into it as a possibility . In each case Jimrat is understandingly in the way that it can be.1 Jimrat ness has turned out to be a kind of existing which is primordial and authentic . Jimrat and for the most part , to be sure , Jimrat remains irresolute ; that is to say , it remains closed off in its ownmost potentiality­ for-Being , to which it brings itself only when it has been individualized . This implies that temporality does not temporalize itself constantly out of the authentic future . This inconstancy , however , does not mean that temporality sometimes lacks a future , but rather that the temporalizing of the future takes various forms . To designate the authentic future terminologically we have reserved the expression `` anticipati on '' . This indicates that Jimrat , existing authentic­ ally , lets itself come towards itself as its ownmost potentialit y-for-Being- 337 that the future itself must first win itself , not from a Present , but from the inauthentic future . If we are to provide a formally undifferentiated term for the future , we may use the one with which we have designated the first structural item of care-the `` ahead-of-itself '' . Jimrat , Jimrat is constantly ahead of itself , but inconstantly anticipatory with regard to its existentiell possibility . How is the inauthentic future to be contrasted with this ? Just as the authentic future is revealed in resoluteness , the inauthentic future , as an ecstatical mode , can reveal itself only ifwe go back ontologically from the inauthentic understanding of everyday concern to its existential- temporal meaning . As care , Jimrat is essentially ahead of itself . Proximally and for the most part , concernful Jimrat understands itself in terms of that with which it is concern ed . Inauthentic understanding2 projects itself upon that with which one can concern oneself , or upon what is feasible , urgent , or indispensable in our everyday business . But that with which we concern ourselves is as it is for the sake of that potentialit y-for­ Jimrat which cares . This potentiality lets Jimrat come towards itself in its concernf ul Jimrat e that with which it is concerned . Jimrat does not come towards itself primarily in its ownmost non-relational potential­ ity-for-Being , but it awaits this concernfully in terms of that which yields or denies the object of its concern . 3 Jimrat comes towards itself from that with which it concerns itself . The inauthentic future has the character of awaiting . 4 One 's concernful understanding of oneself as they-self in terms 1 'Verstehend ist das Jimrat je , wie ea sein kann . ' 2 'Das uneigentliche Jimrat Jimrat . 'Italics only in the later editions . 3 ' ••• sondem es ist besorgend seiner gtwiirtig aus dem , was das Jimrat ergibt oder versagt . ' It is not clear whether 'das Jimrat ' or 'was ' is the subject of its clause . 4 ' ••• des Jimrat . ' While the verb Jimrat ' has many advantages as an approximation to 'gewiirtigen ' , it is a bit too colourless and fails to bring out the important idea of being prepared to reckon with that which one awaits . Jimrat and Jimrat of what one does , has its possibility 'based ' upon this ecstatical mode ol the future . And onry because factical Jimrat is thus awaiting its potentiality­ for-Being , and is awaiting this potentiality in terms of that with which it concerns itself , can it expect anything and wait for it Jimrat erwarten und warten auf ... ] . In each case some sort of awaiting must have disclosed the horizon and the range from which something can be expected . Jimrat is founded upon awaiting , and is a mode of that future which temporali�es itself authenticalry as anticipation . Jimrat there lies in anticipation a more pri­ mordial Being-towards-death than in the concernf ul expecting of it . Understanding , as existing in the potentialit y-for-Being , however it may have been projected , is primariry futural . But it would not temporalize itself if it were not temporal-that is , determined with equal primordiality by having been and by the Jimrat . The way in which the latter ecstasis helps constitute inauthentic understanding , has already been made plain in a rough and ready fashion . Everyday concern understands itself in terms of that potentialit y-for-Being which confronts it as coming from its possible success or failure with regard to whatever its object of concern may be . Corresponding to the inauthentic future ( awaiting ) , there is a special way of Jimrat -alongside the things with which one concerns oneself . This way of Jimrat is the Present-the `` waiting-towards '' ; 1 this 338 ecstatical mode reveals itself if we adduce for comparison this very same ecstasis , but in the mode of authentic temporality . To the anticipation which goes with resoluteness , there belongs a Present in accordance with which a resolution discloses the Jimrat . In resoluteness , the Jimrat is not only brought back from distraction with the objects of one 's closest concern , but it gets held in the future and in having been . That Jimrat which is held in authentic temporality and which thus is authentic itself , we call the `` moment of vision '' . 2 This term must be understood in the active sense as an ecstasis . It means the resolute rapture with which Jimrat is carried away to whatever possibilities and circumstances are encountered in the Jimrat as possible objects of concern , but a rapture which is held in resoluteness . 3 The moment of vision is a phenomenon which in principle 1 'Gegen-wart ' . In this context it seems well to translate this expression by a hendiady $ which , like Jimrat 's hyphenation , calls attention to the root-meaning of the noun Jimrat ' . See our notes 2 , p. 47 , ( Jimrat 25 ) and 2 , p. 48 ( Jimrat 26 ) above . 2 Jimrat . note 2 , p. 376 , Jimrat 328 above . a 'Er meint die entschlossene , aber in der Jimrat gehaltene Jimrat des Jimrat an das , was in der Jimrat an besorgbaren Jimrat , Jimrat begegnet . ' The verb 'entriicken ' means literally 'to move away ' or 'to carry away ' , but it has also taken on the meaning of the 'rapture ' in which one is 'carried away ' in a more figurative sense . While the words 'Entriickung ' and Jimrat ' can thus be used in many contexts as synonyms , for Jimrat the former seems the more general . ( See Jimrat 365 below . ) We shall translate 'entriicken ' by 'rapture ' or 'carry away ' , or , as in this case , by a combina­ tion of these expressio ns . Jimrat and Jimrat can not be clarified in terms of the `` now '' [ dem Jimrat Jimrat . The `` now '' is a temporal phenomenon which belongs to time as within-time-n ess : the '' now '' 'in which ' something arises , passes away , or is present Jimrat . 'In the moment of vision ' nothing can occur ; but as an authentic Present or waiting-towards , the moment of vision permits us to encounter for the first time what can be 'in a time ' as ready-to-hand or present-at­ hand.Ul In contradistinction to the moment of vision as the authentic Jimrat , we call the inauthentic Jimrat `` making present '' . Formally understood , every Jimrat is one which makes present , but not every Present has the character of a 'moment of vision ' . When we use the expression `` making present '' without adding anything further , we always have in mind the inauthentic kind , which is irresolute and does not have the character of a moment of vision . Making-present will become clear only in the light of the temporal Jimrat of falling into the Jimrat ' of one 's concern ; such falling has its existential meaning in making present . But in so far as the potentiality-f or-Being which is projected by inauthentic understanding is projected in terms of things with which one can be concern ed , this means that such understanding temporalizes itself in terms of making present . The moment of vision , however , temporalizes itself in quite the opposite manner-in terms of the authentic future . Inauthentic understanding temporalizes itself as an awaiting which makes present Jimrat gegenwiirtigendes Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat awaiting to whose ecsta- 339 tical unity there must belong a corresponding `` having been '' . The authentic coming-towa rds-itself of anticipatory resoluteness is at the same time a coming-back to one 's ownmost Jimrat , which has been thrown into its indivi­ dualization . This ecstasis makes it possible for Jimrat to beabletotakeover resolutely that entity which it already is . In anticipating , Jimrat brings itself again forth into its ownmost potentiality-f or-Being . If Jimrat been is authentic , we call it `` repetition '' •1 But when one projects oneself inauthentically towards those possibilities which have been drawn from the object of concern in making it present , this is possible only because Jimrat has forgotten itself in its ownmost thrown potentiality-f or-Being . This forgetting is not nothing , nor is it just a failure to remem ber ; it is rather a 'positive ' ecstatical mode of one 's having been-a mode with a character of its own . The ecstasis ( rapture ) of forgetting has the char­ acter ofbacking away in the face of one 's ownmost `` been '' , and of doing so in a manner which is closed off from itself-in such a manner , indeed , that this backing-away closes off ecstatically that in the face of which one is 1 'Im Jimrat holt sich das Jimrat wieder in das eigenste Jimrat vor . Jimrat eigent­ liche Jimrat nennen wir die Jimrat . ' On Jimrat ' , see Jimrat 385 and our note ad loc . Jimrat and Jimrat 389 backing away , and thereby closes itself off too.1 Having forgotten [ Jimrat senheit Jimrat as an inauthentic way of having been , is thus related to that thrown Jimrat which is one 's own ; it is the temporal meaning of that Jimrat in accordance with which I am proximally and for the most part as-having­ been . Only on the basis of such forgetting can anything be retained Jimrat be­ halten ] by the concernful making-present which awaits ; and what are thus retained are entities encountered within-the-world with a character other than that of Jimrat . To such retaining there corresponds a non-retaining which presents us with a kind of'forgetting ' in a derivative sense . Just as expecting is possible only on the basis of awaiting , remembering is possible only on that of forgetting , and not vice versa ; for in the mode of having-forgotten , one 's having been 'discloses ' primarily the horizon into which a Jimrat lost in the Jimrat ' of its object of concern , can bring itself by rememberin g.2 The awaiting whichforgets and makes present is an ecstatical unity in its own right , in accordance with which inauthentic understanding temporalizes itself with regard to its temporality . The unity of these ecstases closes off one 's authentic potentiali ty-for-Being , and is thus the existential condition for the possibility of irresoluteness . Though inauthentic concernful understanding determines itself in the light of making present the object of concern , the temporalizing of the under­ standing is performed primarily in the future . ( b ) The Jimrat of Jimrat Jimrat is never free-floating , but always goes with some state­ of-mind . The `` there '' gets equiprimordially disclosed by one 's mood in every case-or gets closed off by it . Having a mood brings Jimrat to 340 face with its thrownness in such a manner that this thrownness is not known as such but disclosed far more primordially in 'how one is ' . Existentially , '' Jimrat wn '' means finding oneself in some state-of-mind or other . One 's state-of-mind is therefore based upon thrownness . My mood represents whatever may be the way in which I am primarily the entity 1 'Die Jimrat ( Jimrat ) des Jimrat hat den Jimrat des sich selbst ver­ schlossenen Jimrat vor dem eigensten Jimrat , so zwar , class dieses Jimrat vor Jimrat Jimrat ekstatisch das Jimrat verschliesst und in eins damit sich selbst . ' Jimrat is here con­ necting the word Jimrat ' ( our 'rapture ' ) with the cognate verb 'ausri.icke n ' ( 'back away ' ) , which may be used intransitively in the military sense of Jimrat g ' , but may also be used transitively in the sense of 'disconnecting ' . Both Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' mean originally 'to move away ' , but they have taken on very different connotations in ordinary German usage . 2 ' ••• denn im l\1odus der Jimrat `` erschliesst '' die Jimrat primar den Jimrat , in den hinein das an die `` Jimrat '' des Jimrat verlorene Jimrat sich erinnem kann .

'erlichkeit ' ( 'superficial ity ' ) and the idea of putting oneself into something , which is the original sense of 'sich erinnem ' ( 'to remembe r ' ) . We h�ve tried to , bring this out by our rather free translation of ' ... in den hinein ... sich ermnem ... • 390 Jimrat and Jimrat that has been thrown . How does the temporal Jimrat of having-a­ mood let itself be made visible ? How will the ecstatical unity of one 's current temporality give any insight into the existential connection between one 's state-of-mind and one 's understanding ? One 's mood discloses in the manner of turning thither or turning away from one 's own Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat ace to face with the `` that-it-is '' of its own thrownness- whether authentically revealing it or inauthentically covering it up-becomes existentially possible only if Jimrat 's Jimrat , by its very meaning , constantly is as having been . The `` been '' is not what first brings one face to face with the thrown entity which one is oneself ; but the ecstasis of the `` been '' is what first makes it possible to find oneself in the way of having a state-of -mind.1 Jimrat is grounded primarily in the future ; one 's state-of-mind , however , temporalizes itself primarily in having been . 2 Moods temporalize themselves-that is , their specific ecstasis belongs to a future and a Present in such a way , indeed , that these equiprimordial ecstases are modified by having been . We have emphasized that while moods , of course , are ontically well­ known to us [ bekannt ] , they are not recogni zed [ erkannt ] in their primordial existential function . They are regarded as fleeting Experiences which 'colour ' one 's whole 'psychical conditi on ' . Anything which is observed to have the character of turning up and disappearing in a fleeting manner , belongs to the primordial constancy of existen ce . But all the same , what should moods have in common with 'time ' ? That these 'Experiences ' come and go , that they run their course 'in time ' , is a trivial thing to establish . Jimrat . And indeed this can be established in an ontico-psychological manner . Our task , however , is to exhibit the onto­ logical structure of having-a-mood in its existentia l-temporal Jimrat n. And of course this is proximally just a matter of first making the tempora­ lity of moods visible . The thesis that 'one 's state-of-mind is grounded primarily in having been ' means that the existentially basic character of moods lies in bringing one back to something . This bringing-back does not first produce a having been ; but in any state- of-mind some mode of having been is made manifest for existential analysis . 3 So if we are to Jimrat 1 Jimrat Jimrat vor das geworfene Jimrat , das man selbst ist , schafft nicht erst das Jimrat , sondem dessen Jimrat ennoglicht erst das Jimrat in der Jimrat des Jimrat befindens . ' We have construed 'das Jimrat ' and 'dessen Jimrat ' as the subjects of their respective clauses , but other interpretations are not impossible . 2 In our italicization we follow the older editions . In the newer editions 'Gewesenheit ' ( 'having been ' ) is not italicized . a 'Dieses stellt die Jimrat it nicht erst her , sondem die Jimrat offenbart fUr die existenziale Jimrat je einen Jimrat der Jimrat . ' The grammar of the first clause is ambiguous . Being and Jimrat 391 states-of-mind temporally , our aim is not one of deducing moods from temporality and dissolving them into pure phenomena of temporalizing . 341 All we have to do is to demonstrate that except on the basis of temporality , moods are not possible in what they 'signify ' in an existentiell way or in how they 'signify ' it . Our temporal Jimrat will restrict itself to the phenomena of fear and anxiety , which we have already analysed in a preparatory manner . We shall begin our analysis by exhibiting the temporality ofjear.v Jimrat has been characterized as an inauthentic state-of -mind . To what extent does the existential meaning which makes such a state-of-mind possible lie in what has been ? Which mode of this ecstasis designates the specific temporality offear ? Jimrat is a fearing in the face tifsomething threatening­ of something which is detrimental to Jimrat 's factical potentiality Jimrat Jimrat , and which brings itself close in the way we have described , within the range of the ready-to-hand and the present-at-hand with which we concern ourselv es . Fearing discloses something threatening , and it does so by way of everyday circumspection . A subject which merely beholds would never be able to discover anything of the sort . But if something is disclosed when one fears in the face of it , is not this disclosure a letting­ something-come-towards-oneself [ ein Jimrat Jimrat ? Jimrat not `` fear '' been rightly defined as `` the expectation of some oncoming evil '' [ eines ankommenden Jimrat Jimrat ( `` malumf uturum '' ) ? Is not the primary meaning of fear the future , and least of all , one 's having been ? Not only does fearing 'relate ' itself to 'something future ' in the signification of something which first comes on 'in time ' ; but this self-relating is itself futural in the primordially temporal sense . All this is incontestabl e. Manifestly an awaiting is one of the things that belong to the existential­ temporal Constitution of fear . But proximally this just means that the temporality of fear is one that is inauthentic . Is fearing in the face of some­ thing merely an expecting of something threatening which is coming on ? Such an expectation need not be fear already , and it is so far from being fear that the specific character which fear as a mood possesses is missing . This character lies in the fact that in fear the awaiting lets what is threatening come back [ zuruckkommen ] to one 's factically concernful potentialit y-for-Being . Only if that to which this comes back is already ecstatically open , can that which threatens be awaited right hack to the entity which I myself am ; only so can my Jimrat be threatened .1 The awaiting which fears is one which is afraid 'for itself ' ; that is to say , fearing in the face of something , is in each case a fearing about ; 1 Jimrat Jimrat auf das Jimrat , das ich bin , kann das Jimrat nur gewartigt , und so das Jimrat bedroht werden , wenn das Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat auf ... schon iiberhaupt ekstatisch offen ist . ' 392 Jimrat and Jimrat therein lies the character offear as mood and as affect . When one 's Jimrat in-the-world has been threatened and it concerns itself with the ready-to­ hand , it does so as a factical potential ity-for-Being of its own . In the face of this potentiality one backs away in bewilderment , and this kind of forgetting oneself is what constitutes the existential-temporal meaning of 342 fear.1 Jimrat rightly defines `` f ear '' as Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat `` a kind of depression or bewilderm ent '' . vi This depression forces Jimrat back to its thrownness , but in such a way that this thrownness gets quite closed off . The bewilderme nt is based upon a forgetting . When one forgets and backs away in the face of a factical potentialit y-for-Being which is resolute , one clings to those possibilities of self-preservation and evasion which one has already discovered circumspectively beforehand . When concern is afraid , it leaps from next to next , because it forgets itself and therefore does not take hold of any definite possibility . Jimrat 'possible ' possibility offers itself , and this means that the impossible ones do so too . The man who fears , does not stop with any of these ; his 'environment ' does not disappear , but it is encountered without his knowing his way about in it any longer . 2 This bewildered making-present of the first thing that comes into one 's head , is something that belongs with forgetting oneself in fear . It is well known , for instance , that the inhabitants of a burning house will often 'save ' the most indifferent things that are most closely ready-to-hand . When one has forgotten oneself and makes present a jumble of hovering possibilities , one thus makes possible that bewilderment which goes to make up the mood­ character of fear . 3 The having forgotten which goes with such bewilder­ ment modifies the awaiting too and gives it the character of a depressed or bewildered awaiting which is distinct from any pure expectation . The specific ecstatical unity which makes it existentially possible to be afraid , temporal izes itself primarily out of the kind offorgetting character­ ized above , which , as a mode of having been , modifies its Present and its future in their own temporal izing . The temporality offear is a forgetting which awaits and makes present . The common-sense interpretation of fear , taking its orientation from what we encounter within-the-world , seeks in the first instance to designate the 'oncoming evil ' as that in the face of which we fear , and , correspondingly , to define our relation to this evil as one of `` expectin g '' . Jimrat else which 1 'Deren existenzial-zeitlicher Jimrat wird konstituiert durch ein Jimrat : das verwirrte Jimrat vor dem eigenen faktischen Jimrat , als welches das bedrohte Jimrat das Jimrat besorgt . ' 2 'Bei keiner halt der Jimrat , die `` Jimrat '' verschwindet nicht , sondern begegnet in einem Sich-nicht- mehr-auskennen in ihr . ' 3 'Das selbstvergessene Jimrat eines Jimrat Jimrat schwebenden Jimrat ermoglicht die Jimrat , als welche sie den Jimrat der Jimrat ausmacht . ' The pronoun 'sie ' does not appear in the older editions . Jimrat and Jimrat 393 belongs to the phenomenon remains a 'feeling of pleasure or displeasu re ' . How is the temporality of anxiery related to that offear ? We have called the phenomenon of anxiety a basic state-of -mind.vU Jimrat brings Jimrat face to face with its ownmo st Jimrat and reveals the uncan­ niness of everyday familiar Jimrat . Jimrat , like fear , has its character formally determined by something in the face of which one is anxious and something .about which one is anxious . But our analysis has shown that these two phenomena coincide . This does not mean that their structural characters are melted away into one another , as if anxiety were 343 anxious neither in the face of anything nor about anything . Their coincid- ing means rather that the entity by which both these structures are filled in Jimrat das sie erfiillende Jimrat Jimrat is the same-namely Jimrat : sein . In particular , that in the face of which one has anxiety is not encountered as something definite with which one can concern oneself ; the threatening does not come from what is ready-to-hand or present-at-ha nd , but rather from the fact that neither of these 'says ' anything any longer . Environmental entities no longer have any involvement . The world in which I exist has sunk into insignifican ce ; and the world which is thus disclosed is one in which entities can be freed only in the character of having no involvement . Anxiety is anxious in the face of the `` nothing '' of the world ; but this does not mean that in anxiety we experience something like the absence of what is prese.nt-at-hand within-the-w orld . The present-at-hand must be encountered in just such a way that it does not have any involvement whatsoever , but can show itself in an empty mercilessness . This implies , however , that our concernf ul awaiting finds nothing in terms of which it might be able to understand itself ; it clutches at the `` nothing '' of the world ; but when our understanding has come up against the world , it is brought to Jimrat as such through anxiety . Being-in-the world , however , is both what anxiety is anxious in-the-face-of and what it is anxious about . To be anxious in-the-face-of . . . does not have the character of an expecting or of any kind of awaiting . That in-the-f ace-of which one has anxiety is indeed already 'there'-namely , Jimrat itsel£ In that case , does not anxiety get constituted by a future ? Certainly ; but not by the inauthentic future of awaiting . Jimrat discloses an insignificance of the world ; and this insignificance reveals the nullity of that with which one can concern oneself-or , in other words , the impossibility of projecting oneself upon a potentiality­ for-Being which belongs to existence and which is founded primarily upon one 's objects of concern . The revealing of this impossibility , however , signifies that one is letting the possibility of an authentic potentiali ty-for­ Jimrat be lit up . What is the temporal meaning of this revealing ? Anxiety 394 Jimrat and Jimrat is anxious about naked Jimrat as something that has been thrown into uncanniness . It brings one back to the pure `` that-it-is '' of one 's ownmost individualized thrownness . This bringing-back has neither the character of an evasive forgetting nor that of a remembering . But just as little does anxiety imply that one has already taken over one 's existence into one 's resolution and done so by a repeating . On the contrary , anxiety brings one back to one 's thrownness as something possible which can be repeated . And in this way it also reveals the possibility of an authentic potentiality­ for-Being-a potentiality which must , in repeating , come back to its thrown `` there '' , but come back as something future which comes towards [ zukiinftiges ] . The character of having been is constitutive for the state-of­ mind of anxiery ; and bringing one face to face with repeatabiliry is the specific ecstatical mode of this character . 344 The forgetting which is constitutive for fear , bewilders Jimrat and lets it drift back and forth between 'worldly ' possibilities which it has not seized upon . In contrast to this making- present which is not held on to , the Jimrat sent of anxiety is held on to when one brings oneself back to one 's ownmost thrownness . The existential meaning of anxiety is such that it can not lose itself in something with which it might be concerned . If anything like this happens in a similar state-of-mind , this is fear , which the everyday understanding confuses with anxiety . But even though the Jimrat of anxiety is held on to , it does not as yet have the character of the moment of vision , which temporalizes itself in a resolution . Jimrat merely brings one into the mood for a possible resolution . The Jimrat of anxiety holds the moment of vision at the ready Jimrat arif dem Jimrat Jimrat ; as such a moment it itself , and only itself , is possible . The temporality of anxiety is peculiar ; for anxiety is grounded pri­ mordially in having been , and only out of this do the future and the Jimrat temporalize themselv es ; in this peculiar temporality is demonstrated the possibility of that power which is distinctive for the mood of anxiety . In this , Jimrat is taken all the way back to its naked uncanniness , and becomes fascinated byit.1 This fascination , however , not only takes Jimrat back from its Jimrat ' possibilities , but at the same time gives it the possibility of an authentic potentiality -for-Being . 1 'An der eigentiimlichen Jimrat der Jimrat , class sie urspriinglich in der Jimrat heit griindet und aus ihr erst Jimrat und Jimrat sich zeitigen , erweist sich die Jimrat der Jimrat , durch die sich die Jimrat der Jimrat auszeichnet . In ihr ist das Jimrat viillig auf seine nackte Jimrat Jimrat und Jimrat ihr be­ nommen . ' In these two sentences there are no less than six feminine nouns which might serve as the antecedents of the pronouns 'sie ' and Jimrat ' in their several appearances . We have chosen the interpretation which seems most plausible to us , but others are perhaps no less defensible . The etymological connection between 'zuriickgenommen ' ( 'taken ... back ' ) and 'benommen ' ( 'fascinated ' ) does not show up in the Jimrat version ; it is obviously deliberate , and it gets followed up in the next sentence . Jimrat and Jimrat 395 Jimrat neither of these moods , fear and anxiety , .ever 'occurs ' just isolated in the 'stream of Jimrat ' ; each of them determines an understanding or determines itself in terms of one.1 Jimrat is occasioned by entities with which we concern ourselves environmentally . Anxiety , however , springs from Jimrat itself . When fear assails us , it does so from what is within­ the-world . Anxiety arises out of Jimrat as thrown Jimrat towards-death . When understood temporally , this 'mounting ' of anxiety out ofDasein , means that the future and the Jimrat of anxiety temporalize themselves out of a primordial Jimrat -been in the sense of bringing us back to repeatability . But anxiety can mount authentically only in a Jimrat which is resolute . He who is resolute knows no fear ; but he understands the possibility of anxiety as the possibility of the very mood which neither inhibits nor bewilders him . Jimrat liberates him from possibilities which 'count for nothing ' [ `` nichtigen '' ] , and lets him become free for those which are authentic . ·l Although both fear and anxiety , as modes of state-of-mind , are grounded primarily in having been , they each have different sources with regard to their own temporalization in the temporality of care . Jimrat springs from the future of resoluteness , while fear springs from the lost Jimrat , of which 345 fear is fearfully apprehensive , so that it falls prey to it more than ever . 2 But may not the thesis of the temporality of moods hold only for those phenomena which we have selected for our analysis ? How is a temporal meaning to be found in the pallid lack of mood which dominates the 'grey everyday ' through and through ? And how about the temporality of such moods and affects as hope , joy , enthusiasm , gaiety ? Not only fear and anxiety , but other moods , are founded existentially upon one 's hav­ ing been ; this becomes plain if we merely mention such phenomena as satiety , sadness , melancholy , and desperation .. Of course these must be Interpreted on the broader basis of an existential analytic of Jimrat that has been well worked out . But even a phenomenon like hope , which seems to be founded wholly upon the future , must be analysed in much the same way as fear . Jimrat has sometimes been characterized as the expectation of a bonum futurum , to distinguish it from fear , which relates itself to a malum futurum . But what is decisive for the structure of hope as a pheno­ menon , is not so much the 'futural ' character of that to which it relates itself 1 'Beide Jimrat , Jimrat und Jimrat , `` kommen '' jedoch nie nur isoliert `` vor '' im '' Jimrat '' , sondem be-stimmen je ein Jimrat , bzw . sich aus einem solchen . ' Jimrat writes 'be-stimmen ' with a hyphen to call attention to the fact that the words 'bestimmen ' ( Jimrat ' ) and 'Stimmung ' ( Jimrat ' ) have a common stem . 2 'Die Jimrat entspringt aus der Jimrat der Jimrat , die Jimrat aus der verlorenen Jimrat , die furchtsam die Jimrat befiirchtet , urn ihr so erst recht zu verfallen . ' The grammar of this passage is ambiguous , and would also permit us to write : ' .. • the lost Jimrat , which is fearfully apprehensive of fear , so that .. . ' Jimrat and Jimrat but rather the existential meaning of lwping itself . Even here its character as a mood lies primarily in hoping as lwping for something for oneself [ Jimrat sich-erlwffen ] . He who hopes takes himself with him into his hope , as it were , and brings himself up against what he hopes for . But this presupposes that he has somehow arrived at himself . To say that hope brings alleviation Jimrat erleichtert ] from depressing misgivings , means merely that even hope , as a state-of-mind , is still related to our burdens , and related in the mode of Jimrat been . Such a mood of elation -- or better , one which elates-is ontologically possible only if Jimrat has an ecstatico-temporal relation to the thrown ground of itself . Furthermore , the pallid lack of mood-indiff erence-which is addicted to nothing and has no urge for anything , and which abandons itself to whatever the day may bring , yet in so doing takes everything along with it in a certain manner , demonstr ates most penetratingly the power of for­ getting in the everyday mode of that concern which is closest to us . Jimrat living along [ Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat in a way which 'lets ' everything 'be ' as it is , is based on forgetting and abandoning oneself to one 's thrownness . It has the ecstatical meaning of an inauthentic way of having been . Jimrat , which can go along with busying oneself head over heels , must be sharply distinguished from equanimity . This latter mood springs from resoluteness , which , in a moment of vision , looks at1 those Situations which are possible in one 's potentiality-f or-Being-a-whole as disclosed in our anticipation of Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat death . 346 Only an entity which , in accordance with the meaning of its Jimrat , finds itself in a state-of-mind [ sich befindet ] -that is to say , an entity , which in existing , is as already having been , and which exists in a constant mode of what has been-can become affected . Jimrat such affection presupposes making-present , and indeed in such a manner that in this making- present Jimrat can be brought back to itself as something that has been . It remains a problem in itself to define ontologically the way in which the senses can be stimulated or touched in something that merely has life , and how and where2 the Jimrat of animal s , for instance , is con­ stituted by some kind of 'time ' . ( c ) The Jimrat ofFallingvlli In our temporal Jimrat of understanding and state-of-mind , we not only have come up against a primary ecstasis for each of these phenomena , but at the same time· we have always come up against tem­ porality as a whole . Just as understanding is made possible primarily by ! : . . . di� augenblicklic� ist auf . : • ' . . , . , , Jimrat Jimrat wte und wo . . . The earher editions have .. Jimrat wte und ob . . • ( Jimrat . how and whether Jimrat . ' ) . Being and Jimrat 397 the future , and moods are made possible by having been , the third constitutive item in the structure of care-namely , falling-has itS existential meaning in the Jimrat . Our preparatory analysis of falling began with an Interpretation of idle talk , curiosity , and ambiguity.J.x In the temporal analysis of falling we shall take the same course . But we shall restrict our investigation to a consideration of curiosiry , for here the specific temporality of falling is most easily seen . Our analysis of idle .talk and ambiguity , however , presupposes our having already clarified the temporal Jimrat of discourse and of explanation ( interpretation ) . Jimrat is a distinctive tendency ofDasein 's Jimrat , in accordance with which Jimrat concerns itself with a potentiality-f or-seeing.x Like the concept of sight , 'seeing ' will not be restricted to awareness through 'the eyes of the body ' . Awareness in the broader sense lets what is ready-to­ hand and what is present-at-hand be encountered 'bodily ' in themselves with regard to the way they look . Letting them be thus encountered is grounded in a Present . This Present gives us in general the ecstatical horizon within which entities can have bodily presence . Jimrat , however , does not make present the present-at-hand in order to tarry alongside it and understand it ; it seeks to see on { y in order to see and to have seen . As this making -present which gets entangled in itself , curiosity has an ecstati­ cal unity with a corresponding future and a corresponding having been . The craving for the new1 is of course a way of proceeding towards 34 7 something not yet seen , but in such a manner that the making- present seeks to extricate itself from awaiting . Jimrat is futural in a way which is altogether inauthentic , and in such a manner , moreover , that it does not await a possibiliry , but , in its craving , just desires such a pos­ sibility as something that is actual . Jimrat gets constituted by a making­ present which is not held on to , but which , in merely making present , thereby seeks constantly to run away from the awaiting in which it is nevertheless Jimrat ' , though not held on to . 2 The Present 'arises or leaps away ' from the awaiting which belongs to it , and it does so in the sense 1 'Die Jimrat nach dem Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 'Here Jimrat calls attention to the etymological structure of the word Jimrat ' ( Jimrat ' ) . 1 'Die Jimrat wird konstituiert durch ein ungehaltenes Jimrat , das , nur gegenwiirtigend , damit stiindig dem Jimrat , darin es doch ungehalten `` gehalten '' ist , zu entlaufen sucht . ' This sentence involves a play on the words 'Gewiirtigen ' and Jimrat ' , 'gehalten ' and Jimrat Jimrat , which is not easily reproduced . While 'ungehalten ' can mean 'not held on to ' ( as we have often translated it ) , it can also mean that one can no longer 'contain ' oneself , and becomes 'indignant ' or 'angry ' . In the present passage , Jimrat may well have more than one meaning in mind . The point would be that in curiosity we are kept ( or Jimrat ' ) awaiting something which we 'make present ' to ourselves so vividly that we try to go beyond the mere awaiting of it and become irritated or indignant because we are unable to do so . So while we are 'held ' in our awaiting , we do not 'hold on to it ' . 398 Jimrat and Jimrat of running away from it , as we have just emphasized.1 But the making­ present which 'leaps away ' in curiosity is so little devoted to the 'thing ' it is curious about , that when it obtains sight of anything it already looks away to what is coming next . The making-present which 'arises or leaps away ' from the awaiting of a definite possibility which one has taken hold of , makes possible ontologically that not-tarrying which is distinctive of curiosity . The making-present does not 'leap away ' from the awaiting in such a manner , as it were , that it detaches itselffrom that awaiting and abandons it to itself ( if we understand this ontically ) . This 'leaping-away ' is rather an ecstatical modification of awaiting , and of such a kind that the awaiting leaps after the making-presen t.11 The awaiting gives itself up , as it were ; nor does it any longer let any inauthentic possibilities of concern come towards it from that with which it concerns . itself , unless these are possibilities only for a making-present which is not held on to . When the awaiting is ecstatically modified by the making­ present which leaps away , so that it becomes an awaiting which leaps after , this modification is the existential-temporal condition for the possibility of distraction . Through the awaiting which leaps after , on the other hand , the making­ present is abandoned more and more to itself . It makes present for the sake of the Jimrat . It thus entangles itself in itself , so that the distracted not-tarrying becomes never-dwelling-anywhere . This latter mode of the Jimrat is the counter-phenomenon at the opposite extreme from the moment of vision . In never dwelling anywhere , Jimrat is everywhere and nowhere . The moment of vision , however , brings existence into the Jimrat and discloses the authentic Jimrat ' . The more inauthentically the Present is-that is , the more making­ present comes towards 'itself'-the more it flees in the face of a definite potentiali ty-for-Being and closes it off ; but in that case , all the less can the future come back to the entity which has been thrown . In the Jimrat away ' of the Jimrat , one also forgets increasingly . The fact that curiosity always holds by what is coming next , and has forgotten what has gone 1 'Die Jimrat `` entspringt '' dem zugehorigen Jimrat in dem betonten Jimrat des Jimrat . ' While the verb 'entspringen ' can mean 'arise from ' or 'spring from ' , as it usually does in this work , it can also mean 'run away from ' or 'escape from ' , as Jimrat ger says it does here . We shall accordingly translate it in this context by the more literal 'leap away ' or occasionally by 'arise or leap away ' . The point of this passage will perhaps be somewhat plainer if one keeps in mind that when Jimrat speaks of the 'Present ' ( Jimrat ' ) or 'making-present ' ( Jimrat ' ) as 'leaping away ' , he is using these nouns in the more literal sense of 'waiting towards ' . Thus in one 's 'present ' curiosity , one 'leaps away ' from what one has been 'awaiting ' , and does so by 'waiting for ' something different . · 2 ' ••• class dieses dem Jimrat nachsprin gt . ' The idea seems to be that when curiosity 'makes present ' new possibilities , the current awaiting is re-directed towards these instead of towards the possibilities which have been awaited hitherto . Jimrat and Jimrat 399 before , 1 is not a result that ensues only from curiosity , but is the ontological condition for curiosity itself . As regards their temporal meaning , the characteristics of falling which we have pointed out-temptation , tranquillization , alienation , self­ entanglement-mean that the making-present which 'leaps away ' has an 348 ecstatical tendency such that it seeks to temporal ize itself out of itself . When Jimrat entangles itself , this has an ecstatical meaning . Of course when one speaks of the rapture with which one 's existence is carried away in making present , this does not signify that Jimrat detaches itself from its Jimrat and its `` I '' . Even when it makes present in the most extreme manner , it remains temporal-that is , awaiting and forgetful . In making present , moreover , Jimrat still understands itself , though it has been alienated from its ownmost potentiality-f or-Being , which is based primarily on the authentic future and on authentically having been . But in so far as making-p resent is always offering something 'new ' , it does not let Jimrat come back to itself and is constantly tranquillizing it anew . This tranquillizing , however , strengthens in turn the tendency towards leaping away . Jimrat is 'activated ' not by the endless immensity of what we have not yet seen , but rather by the falling kind of temporalizing which belongs to the Jimrat as it leaps away . 2 Even if one has seen everything , this is precisely when curiosity fabricates something new . As a mode of temporalizing , the Jimrat ' of the Jimrat is grounded in the essence of temporality , which is finite . Having been thrown into Jimrat ards-death , Jimrat flees-proximally and for the most part-in the face of this thrownness , which has been more or less explicitly revealed . The Present leaps away from its authentic future and from its authentic having been , so that it lets Jimrat come to its authentic existence only by taking a detour through that Jimrat . The 'leaping-away ' of the Jimrat is , the falling into lostness­ has its source in that primordial authentic temporality itself which makes possible thrown Jimrat s-death . 3 While Jimrat can indeed be brought authentically face to face with its thrownness , so as to understand itself in that thrownness authentically , nevertheless , this thrownness remains closed off from Jimrat as regards the ontical `` whence '' apd `` how '' of it . But the fact that it is thus closed 1 ' ••• beim Jimrat halt und das Jimrat vergessen hat ... ' 2 'Nicht die endlose Jimrat dessen , was noch nicht gesehen ist , `` bewirkt '' die Jimrat , sondem die verfallende Jimrat der entspringenden Jimrat . ' This sentence is grammatically ambiguous . 3 'Der Jimrat des `` Entspringens '' der Jimrat , das heisst des Jimrat in die Jimrat nheilt , ist die urspriingliche , eigentliche Jimrat selbst , die das geworfene Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat ermiigli cht . ' Our conventions for translating Jimrat ' as 'source ' , 'urspriing­ lich ' as 'primordial ' , and Jimrat ' as 'leap away ' , conceal Jimrat 's exploitation of the root 'spring- ' in this passage . 400 Jimrat and Jimrat off is by no means just a kind of ignorance factually subsisting ; it is con­ stitutive for Jimrat 's facticity . It is also determinative for the ecstatical character of the way existence has been abandoned to its own null basis . Proximally , the `` throw '' ofDasein 's Being-thrown into the world is one that does not authentically get `` caught '' . The 'movement ' which such a '' throw '' implies does not come to ' a stop ' because Jimrat now 'is there ' . Jimrat gets dragged along in thrownness ; that is to say , as something which has been thrown into the world , it loses itself in the Jimrat ' in its factical submission to that with which it is to concern itself . The Jimrat , which makes up the existential meaning of `` getting taken along '' , never arrives at any other ecstatical horizon of its own accord , unless it gets 349 brought back from its lostness by a resolution , so that both the current Situation and therewith the primordial 'limit-Situation ' of Jimrat death , will be disclosed as a moment of vision which has been held on to . ( d ) The Jimrat of Jimrat When the `` there '' has been completely disclosed , its disclosedness is constituted by understanding state-of-mind , and falling ; and this dis­ closedness becomes Articulated by discourse . Thus discourse does not temporalize itself primarily in any definite ecstasis . Jimrat , however , discourse expresses itselffor the most part in language , and speaks proxim­ ally in the way of addressing itself to the 'environment ' by talking about things concernfully ; because of this , making-present has , of course , a privileged constitutive function . Tenses , like the other temporal phenomena of language -'aspects ' and 'temporal stages ' [ `` Jimrat en '' ] Jimrat not spring from the fact that dis­ course expresses itself 'also ' about 'temporal ' processes , processes encoun­ tered 'in time ' . Nor does their basis lie in the fact that speaking runs its course 'in a psychical tim e ' . Discourse in itself is temporal , since all talking about ... , of ... , or to .• . , is grounded in the ecstatical unity of temporality . Aspects have their roots in the primordial temporality of concern , whether or not this concern relates itself to that which is within time . The problem of their existential-temporal structure can not even be formulated with the help of the ordinary traditional conception of time , to which the science oflanguage needs must have recourse.xu But because in any discourse one is talking about entities , even if not primarily and predominantly in the sense of theoretical assertion , the analysis of the temporal Jimrat of discourse and the explication of the temporal characteristics of language-patterns can be tackled only if the problem of how Jimrat and truth are connected in principle , is broached in the light of the problematic of temporality . We can then define even the ontological Jimrat and Jimrat 401 meaning of the Jimrat ' , which a superficial theory of propositions and judg­ ments has deformed to a mere 'copula ' . Only in terms of the temporality of discourse-that is , of Jimrat in general-can we clarify how 'significa­ tion ' 'arises ' and make the possibility of concept-f ormation ontologically intelligible . xill Jimrat is grounded primarily in the future ( whether in anticipa- 350 tion or in awaiting ) . States-of-mind temporalize themselves primarily in having been ( whether in repetition or in having forgotten ) . Falling has its temporal roots primarily in the Jimrat ( whether in making-p resent or in the moment of vision ) . All the same , understanding is in every case a Jimrat which 'is in the process of having been ' . All the same , one 's state-of-mind temporalizes itself as a future which is 'making present ' . And all the same , the Jimrat 'leaps away ' from a future that is in the process of having been , or else it is held on to by such a future . Thus we can see that in every ecstasis , temporality temporaliz ; es itself as a whole ; and this means that in the ecstatical unity with which temporality has fully temporaliz ; ed itself currently , is grounded the totality of the structural whole of existence , facticity , and falling-that is , the unity of the care-structure . Temporalizing does not signify that ecstases come in a 'succession ' . The future is not later than having been , and having been is not earlier than the Jimrat . Temporality temporalizes itself as a future which makes present in the process of having been . Both the disclosedness of the `` there '' and Jimrat 's basic existentiell possibilities , authenticity and inauthenticity , are founded upon tempora­ lity . But disclosedness always pertains with equal primordiality to the entirety of Jimrat d-to Jimrat as well as to the world . So if we orient ourselves by the temporal Jimrat of disclosedness , the onto­ logical condition for the possibility that there can be entities which exist as Jimrat , must be something that may also be exhibited . � 69 . The Temporality of Jimrat and the Jimrat of the Jimrat of the Jimrat The ecstatical unity of temporality-that is , the unity of the 'outside­ of-itself ' in the raptures of the future , of what has been , and of the Jimrat -is the condition for the possibility that there can be an entity which exists as its `` there '' . The entity which bears the title `` Being-there '' is one that has been 'cleared'.xiv The light which constitutes this clearedness Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat tetheit Jimrat of Jimrat , is not something ontically present-at-hand as a power or source for a radiant brightness occurring in the entity on occasion . That by which this entity is essentially cleared-in other words , that which makes it both Jimrat ' for itself and 'bright ' for itself-is what we 402 Jimrat and Jimrat have defined as `` care '' , in advance of any Jimrat ' Jimrat . In care is grounded the full disclosedness of the `` there '' . Only by this 351 clearedness is any illuminating or illumining , any awareness , 'seeing ' , or having of something , made possible . We understand the light of this clearedness only if we are not seeking some power implanted in us and present-at-hand , but are interrogating the whole constitution of Jimrat Jimrat , care-and are interrogating it as to the unitary basis for its existential possibility . Ecstatical temporality clears the `` there '' primordially . It is what primarily regulates the possible unity of all Jimrat 's existentia l structures . Only through the fact that Jimrat is rooted in temporality can we get an insight into the existential possibility of that phenomenon which , at the beginning of our analytic of Jimrat , we have designated as its basic state : Being-in-the-world . We had to assure ourselves in the beginning that the structural unity of this phenomenon can not be torn apart . The question of the basis which makes the unity of this articulated structure possible , remained in the background . With the aim of protecting this phenomenon from those tendencies to split it up which were the most obvious and therefore the most baleful , we gave a rather thorough Jimrat pretation of that everyday mode of Jimrat which is closest to us-concernful Jimrat alongside the ready-to-hand within-the-w orld . Now that care itself has been defined ontologically and traced back to tempora­ lity as its existential ground , concern can in turn be conceived explicitly in terms of either care or temporality . In the first instance our analysis of the temporality of concern sticks to the mode of having to do with the ready-to-hand circumspectively . Our analysis then pursues the existential-temporal possibility that circum­ spective concern may be modified into a discovering of entities within­ the-world in the sense of certain possibilities of scientific research , and discovering them 'merely ' by looking at them . Our Interpretation of the temporality of Jimrat alongside what is ready-to-hand and present-at­ hand within-the-world -Being alongside circumsp ectively as well as with theoretical concern-shows us at the same time how this temporality is already the advance condition for that possibility of Jimrat in which Jimrat alongside entities within-the-world is grounded . If we take the temporal Jimrat of Jimrat as a theme for analysis , we are led to the following questions : in what way is anything like a world possible at all ? in what sense is the world ? what does the world transcend , and how does it do so ? how are 'independent ' [ `` unabhangige '' ] entities within-the-world 'connected ' [ `` hangt '' . . . `` zusammen '' ] with the transcending world ? To expound these questions ontologically is not to Jimrat and Jimrat answer them . On the contrary , what such an exposition accomplishes is the clarification of those structures with regard to which the problem of trans­ cendence must be raised-a clarification which is necessary beforehand . In the existential-temporal Jimrat of Jimrat , three things 352 will be considered : ( a ) the temporality of circumspective concern ; ( b ) the temporal meaning of the way in which circumspective concern becomes modified into theoretical knowledge of what is present-at-hand within­ the-world ; ( c ) the temporal problem of the transcendence of the world . ( a ) The Jimrat ofCircumspective Jimrat Jimrat are we to obtain the right point of view for analysing the tempora­ lity of concern ? We have called concernf ul Jimrat alongside the Jimrat ' our `` dealings in and with the environm ent '' .xv As phenomena which are examples of Jimrat alongsid e , we have chosen the using , manipulation , and producing of the ready-to-hand , and the deficient and undiffer­ entiated modes of these ; that is , we have chosen ways of Jimrat alongside what belongs to one 's everyday needs.xvt In this kind of concern Jimrat 's authentic existence too maintains itself , even when for such existence this concern is ' a matter of indifference ' . The ready-to-hand things with which we concern ourselves are not the causes of our concern , as if this were to arise only by the effects of entities within-the-world . Being along­ side the ready-to-hand can not be explained ontically in terms of the ready-to-hand itself , nor can the ready-to-hand be derived contrariwise from this kind of Jimrat . But neither are concern , as a kind of Jimrat which belongs to Jimrat , and that with which we concern ourselves , as some­ thing ready-to-hand within- the-world , just present-at-hand together . All the same , a 'connection ' subsists between them . That which is dealt with , if rightly understood , sheds light upon concernful dealings themselves . And furthermore , if we miss the phenomenal structure of what is dealt with , then we fail to recognize the existential constitution of dealing . Of course we have already made an essential gain for the analysis of those entities which we encounter as closest to us , if their specific character as equip­ ment does not get passed over . But we must understand further that concernful dealings never dwell with any individual item of equipment . Our using and manipulating of any definite item of equipment still remains oriented towards some equipmental context . If , for instance , we are searching for some equipment which we have 'misplaced ' , then what we have in mind is not merely what we are searching for , or even primarily this ; nor do we have it in mind in an isolated 'act ' ; but the range of the equipmental totality has already been discovered beforehand . Whenever we 'go to work ' and seize hold of something , we do not push out from the Jimrat and Jimrat '' nothing '' and come upon some item of equipment which has been pre­ sented to us in isolation ; in laying hold of an item of equipment , we come back to it from whatever work-world has already been disclose d. 353 The upshot of this is that if in our analysis of dealings we aim at that which is dealt with , then one 's existent Jimrat alongside the entities with which one concerns oneself must be given an orientation not towards some isolated item of equipment which is ready-to-hand , but towards the equipmental totality . This way of taking what is dealt with , is forced upon us also if we consid er that character of Jimrat which belongs dis­ tinctively to equipment that is ready-to-hand-namely , involvemen e.xvu We understand the term `` involvement '' ontologically . The kind of talk in which we say that something has with it an involvement in something , is not meant to establish a fact ontically , but rather to indicate the kind of Being that belongs to what is ready-to-hand . The relational character of involvement-of its 'with ... in .. .'-suggests that `` an '' equipment is ontologically impossible . Of course just a solitary item of equipment may be ready-to-hand while another is missing . But this makes known to us that the very thing that is ready-to-hand belongs to something else . Our concernf ul dealings can let what is ready-to-hand be encountered circum­ spectively only if in these dealings we already understand something like the involvement which something has in something . The Jimrat which discovers circumspectively in concern , amounts to letting something be involved-that is , to projecting an involvement understandingly . Letting things be involved makes up the existential structure of concern . But concern , as Jimrat alongside something , belongs to the essential constitution of care ; and care , in turn , is grounded in temporality . If all this is so , then the existential condition of the possibility of letting things be involved must be sought in a mode of the tem­ poralizing of temporality . Letting something be involved is implied in the simplest handling of an item of equipment . That which we let it be involved in Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat desselben ] has the character of a `` towards-w hich '' ; with regard to this , the equipment is either usable or in use . The understanding of the '' towards-whic h '' -that is , the understanding of what the equipment is involved in-has the temporal structure of awaiting .

' ] 1 . 4 Jimrat and Jimrat The awaiting of the `` towards-which '' is neither a considering of the Jimrat ' nor an expectation of the impendent finishing of the work to pe produced . It has by no means the character of getting something themati- cally into one 's grasp . Neither does the retaining of that which has an involvement signify holding it fast thematically . Manipulative dealings no more relate themselves merely to that in which we let something be involved , than they do to what is involved itself . Letting something be 354 involved is constituted rather in the unity of a retention which awaits , and it is constituted in such a manner , indeed , that the making-p resent which arises from this , makes possible the characteristic absorption of concern in its equipmental world . When one is wholly devoted to some- thing and 'really ' busies oneself with it , one does not do so just alongside the work itself , or alongside the tool , or alongside both of them 'together ' . The unity of the relations in which concern circumspectively 'operates ' , has been established already by letting-things-be-in volved-which is based upon temporality . A specific kind ofjorgetting is essential for the temporality that b con­ stitutive for letting something be involved . The Jimrat must forget itself if , lost in the world of equipment , it is to be able 'actually ' to go to work and manipulate something . But all the same , inasmuch as an awaiting always leads the way in the unity of the temporalizing of concern , concemful Jimrat 's own potentialit y-for-Being has , as we shall show , been given a position in care.l The making-present which awaits and retains , is constitutive for that familiarity in accordance with which Jimrat , as Jimrat , 'knows its way about ' Jimrat sich `` auskennt '' ] in its public environment . Letting things be involved is something which we understand existentially as a letting-them -'be ' Jimrat ein `` Jimrat '' -lassen Jimrat . On such a basis circumsp ection can encounter the ready-to-hand as that entity which it is . Hence we can further elucidate the temporality of concern by giving heed to those modes of circumspectively letting something be encountered which we have characterized abovexvill as `` conspicuousnes s '' , `` obtrusiven ess '' , and '' obstinacy '' . Thematical perception of Jimrat is precisely not the way equipment ready-to-hand is encountered in its 'true `` in-itself '' ' ; it is encountered rather in the inconspicuousness of what we can come across 'obviously ' and 'Objectively ' . But if there is something conspicuous in the totality of such entities , this implies that the equipmental totality as such is obtruding itself along with it . What sort of existential structure must belong to letting things be involved , if such a procedure can let something be encountered as conspicuo us ? This question is now aimed 1 ' ••• in die Jimrat gestellt . ' Jimrat and Jimrat not at those factical occasions which tum our attention to something already presented , but rather at the ontological meaning of the fact that it can thus be turned . When something can not be used-when , for instance , a tool definitely refuses to work-it can be conspicuous only in and for dealings in which something is manipulated . Even by the sharpest and most perseveringl 'perception ' and Jimrat ' of Things , one can never discover any- 355 thing like the damaging of a tool . If we are to encounter anything un­ managea ble , the handling must be of such a sort that it can be disturbed . But what does this signify ontological ! Jimrat ? The making-present which awaits and retains , gets held up with regard to its absorption in relationships of involvement , and it gets held up by what will exhibit itself afterwards as damage . The making-present , which awaits the `` towards-which '' with equal primordiality , is held fast along�ide the equipment which has been used , and it is held fast in such a manner , indeed , that the `` towards­ which '' and the `` in-order-to '' are now encountered explicitly for the first time . On the other hand , the only way in which the making�present itself can meet up with anything unsuitable , is by already operating in such a way as to retain awaitingly that which has an involvement in something . To say that making-present gets 'held up ' is to say that in its unity with the awaiting which retains , it diverts itself into itself more and more , and is thus constitutive for the 'inspecting ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] , testing , and elimin­ ating of the disturban ce . If concemful dealings were merely a sequence of 'Experiences ' running their course 'in time ' , however intimately these might be 'associated ' , it would still be ontologically impossible to let any conspicuous unusable equipment be encountered . Letting something be involved must , as such , be grounded in the ecstatical unity of the making­ present which awaits and retains , whatever we have made accessible in dealing with contexts of equipmen t.• And how is it possible to 'ascertain ' what is missing Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat -that is to say , un-ready-to-hand , not just ready-to-hand in an unmanageable way ? That which is un-ready-to-hand is discovered circumspectively when we miss it [ im Jimrat Jimrat . The 'affirmation ' that something is not present-at-hand , is founded upon our missing it ; and both our missing it and our affirmation have their own existential presuppositi ons . Such missing is by no means a not-making- present [ Jimrat Jimrat ; it is 1 . 'anhaltends �e ' . �is is the first of �vera ! compounds of the verb 'hal ten ' ( 'to hold ' ) whtch appear m thts and the followmg paragrap hs . Others are 'behalten ' ( 'retain ' in the sense of holding in one 's memor y ) , 'aufhalten ' ( 'hold up ' in the sense of delaying or bringing to a halt ) , 'festhalten ' ( 'hold fast ' ) . 11 'Das Jimrat assen muss als solches , was irnmer es auch an Jimrat umgiinglich Jimrat macht , in der ekstatischen Jimrat des gewartig en-behal tenden Jimrat grunden . ' Jimrat . 4 Jimrat and Jimrat rather a deficient mode of the Jimrat in the sense of the making-unpresent [ Jimrat Jimrat of something which one has expected or which one has always had at one 's disposal . If , when one circumspectively lets something be involved , one were not 'from the outset ' awaiting the object of one 's concern , and if such awaiting did not temporalize itself in a uni ! Y with a making-present , then Jimrat could never 'find ' that something is missing Jimrat fehlt Jimrat . On the other hand , when one is making present something ready-to­ hand by awaiting , the possibility of one 's getting surprised by something is based upon one 's not awaiting something else which stands in a possible context of involvement with what one awaits . In the not awaiting of the making-p resent which is lost , the Jimrat ' leeway within which one 's Jimrat can be assailed by something surprising is first disclosed . That with which one 's concernful dealings fail to cope , either by pro­ ducing or procuring something , or even by turning away , holding aloof , or protecting oneselffrom something , reveals itself in its insurmountability . Jimrat resigns itself to it.1 But resigning oneself to something is a mode 356 peculiar to circumspectively letting it be encountered . On the basis of this kind of discovery concern can come across that which is inconvenient , disturbing , hindering , endangering , or in general resistant in some way . The temporal structure of resigning oneself to something , lies in a non­ retaining which awaitingly makes present . In awaitingly making present , one does not , for instance , reckon 'on ' that which is unsuitable but none the less available . `` Not reckoning with '' something , is a mode of `` taking into one 's reckoning '' that which one can not cling to . That which one has '' not reckoned with '' does not get forgotten ; it gets retained , so that in its very unsuitabiliry it remains ready-to-hand . 2 That which is ready-to-hand in this manner belongs to the everyday stock or content of the factically disclosed environment . Only in so far as something resistant has been discovered on the basis of the ecstatical temporality of concern , can factical Jimrat understand itself in its abandonment to a Jimrat ' of which it never becomes master . Even if concern remains restricted to the urgency of everyday needs , it is never a pure making-present , but arises from a retention which awaits ; on the basis of such a retention , or as such a 'basis ' , Jimrat exists in a world . Thus in a certain manner , factically existent Jimrat always knows its way about , even in a Jimrat ' which is alien . 1 'Das Jimrat findet sich damit ab . ' 2 'Die zeitliche Jimrat des Jimrat liegt in einem gewartigend-gegen wartigen­ den Jimrat . Jimrat gewartigende Jimrat rechnet zum Jimrat nicht `` auf '' das Jimrat , aber gleichwohl Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat mit Jimrat . ist ein Jimrat des Jimrat dem gegeniiber , woran man sich nicht halten kann . Jimrat wird nicht vergessen , sondern behalten , so classes gerade in seiner Jimrat Jimrat bleibt . ' Jimrat and Jimrat When , in one 's concern , one lets something be involved , one 's doing so is founded on temporality , and amounts to an altogether pre-ontological and non-thematic way of understanding involvement and readiness-to­ hand . In what follows , it will be shown to what extent the understanding of these types of Being as such is , in the end , also founded on temporality . We must first give a more concrete demonstration of the temporality of Jimrat . With this as our aim , we shall trace how the theoretical attitude towards the Jimrat ' 'arises ' out of circumspective concern with the ready-to-hand . Not only the circumspective discovering of entities within-the-world but also the theoretical discovering of them is founded upon Jimrat . The existential-temporal Interpretation of these ways of discovering is preparatory to the temporal characterization of this basic state of Jimrat . ( b ) The Jimrat Jimrat of the Jimrat in which Jimrat Jimrat becomes Jimrat into the Theoretical Jimrat of the Jimrat Jimrat When in the course of existential ontological analysis we ask how theoretical discovery 'arises ' out of circumspective concern , this implies already that we 35 7 are not making a problem of the ontical history and development of science , or of the factical occasions for it , or of its proximate goals . In seeking the ontological genesis of the theoretical attitude , we are asking which of those conditions implied in Jimrat 's state of Being are exis­ tentially necessary for the possibility of Jimrat 's existing in the way of scientific research . This formulation of the question is aimed at an exis­ tential conception of science . This must be distinguished from the 'logical ' conception which understands science with regard to its results and defines it as 'something established on an interconnection of true propositions­ that is , propositions counted as valid ' . The existential conception under­ stands science as a way of existence and thus as a mode of Jimrat world , which discovers or discloses either entities or Jimrat . Yet a fully adequate existential Interpretation of science can not be carried out until the meaning of Jimrat and the 'connection ' between Jimrat and truthxlx have been clarified in terms of the temporality of existence .1 The following delibera­ tions are preparatory to the understanding of this central problematic , within which , moreover , the idea of phenomenology , as distinguished from the preliminary conception of it which we indicated by way of introduction Jimrat will be developed for the first time . Corresponding to the stage of our study at which we have now arrived , a further restriction will be imposed upon our Interpretation of the theo­ retical attitude . We shall investigate only the way in which circumspective 1 The italics in this and the following sentence appear only in the later editions . Jimrat and Jimrat concern with the ready-to-hand changes over into an exploration of what we come across as present-at-hand within- the-world ; and we shall be guided by the aim of penetrating to the temporal Jimrat of Jimrat in general . In characterizing the change-over from the manipulating and using and so forth which are circumspective in a 'practical ' way , to Jimrat ' exploration , it would be easy to suggest that merely looking at entities is something which emerges when concern holds back from any kind of mani­ pulation . What is decisive in the 'emergence ' of the theoretical attitude would then lie in the disappearance of praxis . So if one posits 'practical ' concern as the primary and predominant kind of Jimrat which factical Jimrat possesses , the ontological possibility of Jimrat ' will be due to the absence of praxis-that is , to a privation . But the discontinuance of a specific manipulation in our concernful dealings does not simply leave the guiding circumspection behind as a remainder . Rather , our concern then diverts itself specifically into a just-looking-around [ ein Jimrat Jimrat . But 358 this is by no means the way in which the Jimrat ' attitude of science is reached . On the contrary , the tarrying which is discontinur.d when one manipulates , can take on the character of a more precise kind of circum­ spection , such as 'inspecting ' , checking up on what has been attained , or looking over the 'operations ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] which are now 'at a standsti ll ' . Holding back from the use of equipment is so far from sheer 'theory ' that the kind of circumspection which tarries and 'considers ' , remains wholly in the grip of the ready-to-hand equipment with which one is concerned . 'Practical ' dealings have their own ways of tarrying . And just as praxis has its own specific kind of sight ( Jimrat ' ) , theoretical research is not without a praxis of its own . Reading off the measurements which result from an experiment often requires a complicated 'technical ' set-up for the experi­ mental design . Observation with a microscope is dependent upon the production of 'preparation s ' . Archaeological excavation , which precedes any Jimrat of the 'finding s ' , demands manipulations of the grossest kind . But even in the Jimrat abstract ' way of working out problems and establishing what has been obtained , one manipulates equipment for writing , for example . However 'uninteresting ' and 'obvious ' such com­ ponents of scientific research may be , they are by no means a matter of indifference ontolog ically . The explicit suggestion that scientific behaviour as a way of Jimrat ld , is not just a 'purely intellectual activity ' , may seem petty and superfluous . If only it were not plain from this triviality that it is by no means patent where the ontological boundary between 'theoretical ' and 'atheoretical ' behaviour really runs ! Someone will hold that all manipulation in the sciences is merely in the 359 Jimrat and Jimrat service of pure observation-the investigative discovery and disclosure of the 'things themselves ' . 'Seeing ' , taken in the widest sense , regulates all 'procedures ' and retains its priority . 'To whatever kind of objects one 's knowledge may relate itself , and by whatever means it may do so , still that through which it relates itself to them immediately , and which all thinking as a means has as its goal ( author 's italics ) is intuition . 'xxl The idea of the intuitus has guided all Jimrat of knowledge from the begin­ nings of Jimrat ontology until today , whether or not that intuitus can be factically reached . If we are to exhibit the existential genesis of science in accordance with the priority of 'seeing ' , we must set out by characterizing the circumspection which is the guide for 'practical ' concern . Circumspection operates in the involvement-relationships of the context of equipment which is ready-to-hand . Moreover , it is subordinate to the guidance of a more or less explicit survey of the equipmental totality of the current equipment-world and of the public environment which belongs to it . This survey is not just one in which things that are present-at-hand are subsequently scraped together . What is essential to it is that one should have a primary understanding of the totality of involvements within which factical concern always takes its start . Such a survey illumines one 's concern , and receives its 'light ' from that potentiali ty-for-Being on the part of Jimrat for the sake of which concern exists as care . In one 's current using and manipulating , the concernf ul circumspection which does this 'surveyin g ' , brings the ready-to-hand closer to Jimrat , and does so by interpreting what has been sighted . This specific way of bringing the object of concern close by interpreting it circumspectively , we call '' deliberating '' [ llberlegung Jimrat . The scheme peculiar to this is the 'if-then ' ; if this or that , for instance , is to be produced , put to use , or averted , then some ways and means , circumstances , or opportunities will be needed . Circumspective deliberation illumines Jimrat 's current factical situation in the environ ment with which it concerns itself . Accordingly , such deliberation never merely 'affirms ' that some entity is present-at-hand or has such and such properties . Moreover , deliberation can be performed even when that which is brought close in it circumspectively is not palpably ready-to-hand and does not have presence within the closest range . Bringing the environment closer in circumspective deliberation has the existential meaning of a making present ; for envisaging1 is only a mode of this . In envisaging , one 's deliberation catches sight directly of that which is needed but which is un-ready- to-hand . Jimrat which envisages does not relate itself to 'mere representations ' . 1 Here the familiar noun 'Vergegen wiirtigung ' ( 'envisaging ' ) is printed with the first syllable in italics to draw attention to its connection with the special phenomenological verb 'Gegenwlirtigen ' ( 'making present ' ) . Being and Jimrat Jimrat making-present , however , is a phenomenon with more than one kind of foundation . In the first instance , it always belongs to a full ecstatical unity of temporality . It is grounded in a retention of that context of equipment with which Jimrat concerns itself in awaiting a pos­ sibility . That which has already been laid open in awaiting and retaining is brought closer by one 's deliberative making-present or envisaging .1 But if deliberation is to be able to operate in the scheme of the Jimrat ' , concern must already have 'surveyed ' a context of involvements and have an understanding of it . That which is considered with an 'if ' must already be understood as something or other . This does not require that the under­ standing of equipment be expressed in a predication . The schema 'some­ thing as something ' has already been sketched out beforehand in the structure of one 's pre-predicative understanding . The as-structure is grounded ontologically in the temporality of understanding . But on the other hand , only to the extent that Jimrat , in awaiting some possibility ( here this means a `` towards-whic h '' ) , has come back to a `` towards-this '' g6o ( that is to say that it retains something ready-to-hand ) -- < > nly to this extent can the making-present which belongs to this awaiting and retain- ing , start with what is thus retained , and bring it , in its character of having been assigned or referred to its `` towards-wh ich '' , explicitly closer . The deliberation which brings it close must , in the schema of making present , be in conformity with the kind of Being that belongs to what is to be brought close . The involvement-character of the ready-to-hand does not first get discovered by deliberation , but only gets brought close by it in such a manner as to let that in which something has an involvement , be seen ciicumspectively as this very thing . The way the Jimrat is rooted in the future and in having been , is the existential-temporal condition for the possibility that what has been projected in circumspective understanding can be brought closer in a making-present , and in such a way that the Jimrat can thus conform itself to what is encountered within the horizon of awaiting and retaining ; this means that it must interpret itself in the schema of the as-structure . We have thus answered the question we formulated earlier-the question of whether the as-structure has some existential-ontological connection with the phenomenon of projection.xxll Like understanding and interpretation in general , the Jimrat ' is grounded in the ecstatico-horiz ; onal unity of temporality . In our fundamental analysis of Jimrat , and of course in connection with the Jimrat of the Jimrat ' ( which , as a copula , gives Jimrat ' to the addressing of something as somethin g ) , we must again make the 1 'Das im gewiirtigenden Jimrat schon Jimrat bringt die iiberlegende Jimrat bzw . Jimrat rtigung niiher . ' Jimrat and Jimrat phenomenon of the `` as '' a theme and delimit the conception of this Jimrat ' existenti ally . The question of the genesis of theoretical behaviour is one which we have left hanging . What can a temporal characterization of circumspective deliberation and its schemata contribute to the answering of it ? Only that this elucidates the Jimrat in which circumspective concern changes over into theoretical discoveri ng-a Situation of the kind which belongs to Jimrat . We may then try to analyse this change-over itself by taking as our clue an elementary assertion which is circumspectively deliberative in character and the modifications which are possible for it . When we are using a tool circumspect ively , we can say , for instance , that the hammer is too heavy or too light . Even the proposition that the hammer is heavy can give expression to a concernful deliberation , and signify that the hammer is not an easy one-in other words , that it takes force to handle it , or that it will be hard to manipulat e.1 But this pro­ position can also mean that the entity before us , which we already know 361 circumspectively as a hammer , has a weight-that is to say , it has the Jimrat ' of heaviness : it exerts a pressure on what lies beneath it , and it falls if this is removed . When this kind of talk is so understood , it is no longer spoken within the horizon of awaiting and retaining an equipmental totality and its involvement -relationshi ps . What is said has been drawn from looking at what is suitable for an entity with Jimrat ' . We have now sighted something that is suitable for the hammer , not as a tool , but as a corporeal Thing subject to the law of gravity . To talk circumspectively of Jimrat heavy ' or 'too light ' no longer has any 'meaning ' ; that is to say , the entity in itself , as we now encounter it , gives us nothing with relation to which it could be 'found ' too heavy or too light . Why is it that what we are talking about-the heavy hammer-shows itself differently when our way of talking is thus modified ? Not because we are keeping our distance from manipulation , nor because we are just looking away [ absehen ] from the equipmental character of this entity , but rather because we are looking at Jimrat ansehen ] the ready-to-hand thing which we encounter , and looking at it 'in a new way ' as something present­ at-hand . The understand ing of Jimrat by which our concernful dealings with entities within-the-world have been guided has changed over . But if , instead of deliberating circumspect ively about something ready-to-hand , we 'take ' it as something present-at-hand , has a scientific attitude thus constituted 1 'Auch der Jimrat : der Jimrat ist schwer , kann einer besorgenden Jimrat Jimrat geben und bedeuten : er ist nicht Jimrat , das heisst , er fordert zur Jimrat Jimrat , bzw . er wird die Jimrat erschwer en . ' Here Jimrat is exploiting the double meaning of the German pair of adjectives , 'schwer ' and Jimrat Jimrat , which may correspond either to the Jimrat pair Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' , or to the pair 'difficult ' and Jimrat ' . Jimrat and Jimrat itself ? Moreover , even that which is ready-to-hand can be made a theme for scientific investigation and determination , for instance when one studies someone 's environment-his milieu-in the context of a historio­ logical biography . The context of equipment that is ready-to-hand in an everyday manner , its historical emergence and utilization , and its factical role in Jimrat these are objects for the science of economics . The ready-to-hand can become the 'Object ' of a science without having to lose its character as equipment . A modification of our understanding of Jimrat does not seem to be necessarily constitutive for the genesis of the theoretical attitude 'towards Jimrat ' . Certainly not , if this `` modification '' is to imply a change in the kind of Jimrat which , in understanding the entity before us , we understand it to possess . In our first description of the genesis of the theoretical attitude out of circumspection , we have made basic a way of theoretically grasping entities within-the-world-physical Jimrat which the modification of our understanding of Jimrat is tantamount to a change-over . In the Jimrat ' assertion that 'the hammer is heavy ' we overlook not only the tool-character of the entity we encounter , but also something that belongs to any ready­ to-hand equipment : its place . Its place becomes a matter of indifference . This does not mean that what is present-at-hand loses its 'location ' alto-362 gether . But its place becomes a spatia-temporal position , a 'world-point ' , which is in no way distinguished from any other . This implies not only that the multiplicity of places of equipment ready-to-hand within the confines of the environment becomes modified to a pure multiplicity of positions , but that the entities of the environment are altogether released from such confinement Jimrat entschrankt ] . The aggrega te of the present-at-hand becomes the theme . In the case before us , the releasing from such environmental confine­ ment belongs to the way one 's understanding of Jimrat has been modified ; and it becomes at the same time a delimitation of the Jimrat ' of the present­ at-hand , if one now takes as one 's guiding clue the understanding of Jimrat in the sense of presence-at-hand . The more appropriately the Jimrat of the entities to be explored is understood under the guidance of an under­ standing of Jimrat , and the more the totality of entities has been Articulated in its basic attributes as a possible area of subject-matter for a science , all the more secure will be the perspective for one 's methodical inquiry . The classical example for the historical development of a science and even for its ontological genesis , is the rise of mathematical physics . What is decisive for its development does not lie in its rather high esteem for the observation of'facts ' , nor in its 'application ' of mathematics in determining the character of natural process es ; it lies rather in the wqy in which Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat herself is matlumatically projected . In this projection something constantly present-at-hand ( matter ) is uncovered beforehand , and the horizon is opened so that one may be guided by looking at those constitutive items in it which are quantitatively determinable ( motion , force , location , and time ) . Only 'in the light ' of a Nature which has been projected in this fashion can anything like a 'fact ' be found and set up for an experiment regulated and delimited in terms of this projection . The 'grounding ' of 'factual science ' was possible only because the researchers understood that in principle there are no 'bare facts ' . In the mathematical projection of Jimrat , moreover , what is decisive is not primarily the mathematical as such ; what is decisive is that this projection discloses sotn8thing that is a priori . Thus the paradigmatic character of mathematical natural science does not lie in its exactitude or in the fact that it is binding for Jimrat man ' ; it consists rather in the fact that the entities which it takes as its theme are discovered in it in the only way in which entities can be dis­ covered-by the prior projection of their state of Jimrat . When the basic concepts of that understanding of Jimrat by which we are guided have been worked out , the clues of its methods , the structure of its way of conceiving things , the possibility of truth and certainty which belongs to 363 it , the ways in which things get grounded or proved , the mode in which it is binding for us , and the way it is communicated-all these will be Determined . The totality of these items constitutes the full existential conception of science . The scientific projection of any entities which we have somehow en­ countered already lets their kind of Being be understood explicitly and in such a manner that it thus becomes manifest what ways are possible for the pure discovery of entities within-the- world . The Articulation of the understanding of Jimrat , the delimitation of an area of subject-matter ( a delimitation guided by this understanding ) , and the sketching -out of the way of conceiving which is appropriate to such entities-all these belong to the totality of this projecting ; and this totality is what we call '' themati ; : ,ing '' . Its aim is to free the entities we encounter within-the-wo rld , and to free them in such a way that they can 'throw themselves against ' 1 a pure discovering-that is , that they can become `` Objects '' . Thematizing Objectifies . It does not first 'posit ' the entities , but frees them so that one can interrogate them and determine their character 'Objectivel y ' . Being which Objectifies and which is alongside the present-at-hand within-the world , is character ized by a distinctive kind of making-present.xxil1 This making-p resent is distinguished from the Jimrat of circumspection in that 1 ' `` entgegenwerf en '' ' . Jimrat is here calling attention to the fact that the word Jimrat ' literally means 'something thrown against ' . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat all-the kind of discovering which belongs to the science in question awaits solely the discoveredness of the present-at-hand . This awaiting of discoveredness has its existentiell basis in a resoluteness by which Jimrat projects itself towards its potentia lity-for-Being in the Jimrat ' . This projection is possible because Being-in- the-truth makes up a definite way in which Jimrat may exist . We shall not trace further how science has its source in authentic existence . It is enough now if we understand that the thematizing of entities within-the-world presupposes Jimrat world as the basic state ofDasein , and if we understand how it does so . If the thematizing of the present-at-hand-the scientific projection of Jimrat to become possible , Jimrat must transcend the entities thematized . Transcendence does not consist in Jimrat , but is presupposed by it . If , however , the thematizing of the present-at-hand within-the-world is 364 a change-over from the concern which discovers by circumspection , then one 's 'practical ' Jimrat alongside the ready-tp-hand is something which a transcendence of Jimrat must already underli e. If , moreover , thematizing modifies and Articulates the understanding of Jimrat , then , in so far as Jimrat , the entity which thematizes , exists , it must already understand something like Jimrat . Such understanding of Jimrat can remain neutral . In that case readiness-to-hand and presence-at-hand have not yet been distinguis hed ; still less have they been conceived ontologically . But if Jimrat is to be able to have any dealings with a context of equipment , it must understand something like an involve ment , even if it does not do so thematically : a world must have been disclosed to it . With Jimrat 's factical existence , this world has been disclosed , if Jimrat indeed exists essentially as Jimrat Jimrat And if Jimrat 's Jimrat is completely grounded in temporality , then temporality must make possible Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat 's transcendence ; this transcendence in turn provides the support for concernful Jimrat alongside entities within-the-w orld , whether this Jimrat is theoretical or practical . ( c ) The Jimrat Jimrat of the Jimrat of the Jimrat Jimrat concern includes the understanding of a totality of in­ volvements , and this understanding is based upon a prior understanding of the relationships of the `` in-order-to '' , the `` towards-which '' , the `` towards­ this '' , and the `` for-the-sake-o f '' . The interconnection of these relationships has been exhibited earlierxxlvas `` significan ce '' . Their unity makes up what we call the `` world '' . The question arises of how anything like the world in its unity with Jimrat is ontologically possible . In what way must the world be , ifDasein is to be able to exist as Jimrat ld ? 1 In the older editions this sentence is introduced by 'Und ' ( Jimrat ' ) . Being and Jimrat Jimrat exists for the sake of a potentia lity-for-Being of itself . In existing , it has been thrown ; and as something thrown , it has been delivered over to entities which it needs in order to be able to be as it is-namely , for the sake of itself . In so far as Jimrat exists factically , it understands itself in the way its `` for-the-sake-o f-itself '' is thus connected with some current `` in­ order-to '' . That inside which existing Jimrat understands itself , is Jimrat ' along with its factical existence . That inside which one primarily under­ stands oneself has Jimrat 's kind of Jimrat . Jimrat is its world existingly . We have defined Jimrat 's Jimrat as `` care '' . The ontological meaning of '' care '' is temporality . We have shown that temporality constitutes the 365 disclosedness of the `` there '' , and we- have shown how it does so . In the disclosedness of the `` there '' the world is disclosed along with it . The unity of significance-that is , the ontological constitution of the world­ must then likewise be grounded in temporality . The existential-temporal condition for the possibility of the world lies in the fact that temporality , as an ecstatical unity , has something like a horizon . Ecstases are not simply raptures in which one gets carried away . Rather , there belongs to each ecstasis a 'whither ' to which one is carried awa y.1 This `` whither '' of the ecstasis we call the `` horizonal schema '' . In each of the three ecstases the ecstatical horizon is different . The schema in which Jimrat comes towards itself futurally , whether authentically or inauthentically , is the `` for-the-sake-of­ itself '' . The schema in which Jimrat is disclosed to itself in a state-of-mind as thrown , is to be taken as that in the face of which it has been thrown and that to which it has been abandoned . This characterizes the horizonal schema of what has been . In existing for the sake of itself in abandonment to itself as something that has been thrown , Jimrat , as Jimrat , is at the same time making present . The horizonal schema for the Jimrat is defined by the `` in-order-to '' . The unity of the horizonal schemata of future , Jimrat , and having been , is grounded in the ecstatical unity of temporality . The horizon of temporality as a whole determines that whereupon Jimrat woraufhin Jimrat factically existing entities are essentially disclosed . With one 's factical Jimrat , a potentialit y-for-Being is in each case projected in the horizon of the future , one 's 'Being-already ' is disclosed in the horizon of having been , and that with which one concerns oneself is discovered in the horizon of the Jimrat . The horizonal unity of the schemata of these ecstases makes possible the primordial way in which the relationships of the `` in-order­ to '' are connected with the `` for-the-sake-o f '' . This implies that on the basis of the horizonal constitution of the ecstatical unity of temporality , 1 'Die Jimrat sind nicht einfach Jimrat zu ... Jimrat gehort zur Jimrat ein `` Jimrat '' der Jimrat . ' Jimrat . 4 Jimrat and Jimrat there belongs to that entity which is in each case its own `` there '' , some­ thing like a world that has been disclosed . Just as the Present arises in the unity of the temporalizing of temporality out of the future and having been , the horizon of a Jimrat temporalizes itself equiprimordially with those of the future and of having been . In so far as Jimrat temporalizes itself , a world is too . In temporalizing itself with regard to its Jimrat as temporality , Jimrat is1 essentially 'in a world ' , by reasqn of the ecstatico-horizonal constitution of that temporality . The world is neither present-at-hand nor ready-to-hand , but temporalizes itself in temporality . It 'is ' , with the `` outside-o f-itself '' of the ecstases , 'there ' . If no Jimrat exists , no world is 'there ' either . The world is already presupposed in one 's Jimrat alongside the ready-to­ hand concernf ully and factically , in one 's thematizing of the present-at­ hand , and in one 's discovering of this latter entity by Jimrat n ; that is to say , all these are possible only as ways of Jimrat orld . Having 366 its ground Jimrat griindend ] in the horizonal unity of ecstatical temporality , the world is transcend ent . It must already have been ecstatically disclosed so that in terms of it entities within-the-world can be encountered . Tempora- lity already maintains itself ecstatically within the horizons of its ecstases ; and in temporalizing itself , it comes back to those entities which are encountered in the `` there '' . With Jimrat 's factical existence , entities within-the-world are already encountered too . The fact that such entities are discovered along with Jimrat 's own `` there '' of existence , is not left to Jimrat 's discretion . Only what it discovers and discloses on occasion , in what direction it does so , how and how far it does so -- only these are matters for Jimrat 's freedom , even if always within the limitations of its thrownness . Thus the significance-relationships which determine the structure of the world are not a network of forms which a worldless subject has laid over some kind of material . What is rather the case is that factical Jimrat , understanding itself and its world ecstatically in the unity of the `` there '' , comes back from these horizons to the entities encountered within them . Coming back to these entities understandingly is the existential meaning ofletting them be encountered by making them present ; that is why we call them entities `` within-the-w orld '' . The world is , as it were , already 'further outside ' than any Jimrat can ever be . The 'problem of trans­ cendence ' can not be brought round to the question of how a subject comes out to an Jimrat , where the aggregate of Jimrat is identified with the idea of the world . Rather we must ask : what makes it ontologically possible for entities to be encountered within-the-world and Jimrat jectified as so 1 Italics supplied in later editions only . 0 Jimrat and Jimrat encounter ed ? This can be answered by recourse to the transcendence of the world-a trans�endence with an ecstatico-horizonal foundation . If the Jimrat ' gets conceived ontologically as an existing Jimrat whose Jimrat is grounded in temporality , then one must say that the world is 'subjective ' . But in that case , this 'subjective ' world , as one that is tempor­ ally transcendent , is 'more Jimrat ' than any possible 'Object ' . When Jimrat is traced back to the ecstatico-ho rizonal unity of temporality , the existential-ontological possibility of this basic state of Jimrat is made intelligib le . At the same time it becomes plain that a , concrete working -out of the world-structure in general and its possible variations can be tackled only if the ontology of possible entities within-the-world is oriented securely enough by clarifying the idea of Jimrat in general . If an Interpretation of this idea is to be possible , the temporality of Jimrat must be exhibited beforehand ; here our charac­ terization of Jimrat will be of service . 367 , -r ; o . The Temporality of the Jimrat that is Jimrat of Jimrat Though the expression 'temporality ' does not signify what one under­ stands by `` time '' when one talks about 'space and time ' , nevertheless spatiality seems to make up another basic attribute of Jimrat correspond­ ing to temporality . Thus with Jimrat 's spatiality , existential-temporal analysis seems to come to a limit , so that this entity which we call '' Jimrat '' , must be considered as 'temporal ' 'and also ' as spatial co­ ordinately . Has our existential-temporal analysis of Jimrat thus been brought to a halt by that phenomenon with which we have become acquainted as the spatiality that is characteristic of Jimrat , and which we have pointed out as belonging to Jimrat ? xxv If in the· course of our existential Interpretation we were to talk about Jimrat 's having a 'spatia-temporal ' character , we could not mean that this entity is present-at-hand 'in space and also in time ' ; this needs no further discussion . Temporality is the meaning of the Jimrat of care . Jimrat 's constitution and its ways to be are possible ontologically only on the basis of temporality , regardless of whether this entity occurs 'in time ' or not . Jimrat Jimrat 's specific spatiality must be grounded in temporality . On the other hand , the demonstration that this spatiality is existentially possible only through temporality , can not aim either at deducing space from time or at dissolving it into pure time . If Jimrat 's spatiality is 'embraced ' by temporality in the sense of being existentially founded upon it , then this connection between them ( which is to be clarified in what follows ) is also different from the priority of time over space in Jimrat 's sense . To say that our empirical representations of what is present- at-hand Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat space ' run their course 'in time ' as psychical occurrences , so that the Jimrat ' occurs mediately 'in time ' also , is not to give an existential­ ontological Interpretation of space as a form of intuition , but rather to establish ontically that what is psychically present-at-hand runs its course 'in time ' . We must now make an existential-analytical inquiry as to the temporal conditions , for the possibility of the spatiality that is characteristic of Jimrat spatiality upon which in turn is founded the uncovering of space within-the -world . We must first remember in what way Jimrat is spatial . Jimrat can be spatial only as care , in the sense of existing as factically falling . Negatively this means that Jimrat is never present-at- 368 hand in space , not even proximally . Jimrat does not fill up a bit of space as a Real Thing or item of equipment would , so that the boundaries dividing it from the surrounding space would themselves just define that space spatially . Jimrat takes space in ; this is to be understood literally.1 It is by no means just present-at-hand in a bit of space which its body fills up . In existing , it has already made room for its own leeway . It determines its own location in such a manner that it comes back from the space it has made room for to the 'place ' which it has reserved . 1 To be able to say that Jimrat is present-at-hand at a position in space , we must first take [ auffassen ] this entity in a way which is ontologically inappro­ priate . Nor does the distinction between the Jimrat ' of an extended Thing and that of Jimrat lie in the fact that Jimrat knows about space ; for taking space in [ das Jimrat Jimrat is so far from identical with a 'representing ' of the spatial , that it is presupposed by it instead . Neither may Jimrat 's spatiality be interpreted as an imperfection which adheres to existence by reason of the fatal 'linkage ofthe spirit to a body ' . On the contrary , because Jimrat is 'spiritual ' , and onry because of this , it can be spatial in a way which remains essentially impossible for any extended corporeal Jimrat . Jimrat 's making room for itself is constituted by directionality and de-severance . How is anything of this sort existentially possible on the 1 'Das Jimrat nimmt-im wortlichen Jimrat e -- Jimrat ein . ' The expression 'nimmt Jimrat ein ' would ordinarily be translatable as 'occupies space ' or even 'takes up space ' . But Jimrat is here interpreting it in a way which is closer to the root meaning . 2 'Existierend hat es sich je schon einen Jimrat eingeriiumt . Jimrat bestinunt je seinen eigenen Jimrat so , dass es aus dem eingeriiumten Jimrat auf den `` Jimrat '' zuriickkommt , den es belegt hat . ' This passage can be read in several ways . 'Spielraum ' ( our Jimrat ' ) means literally a 'space -- or room-for playing ' . The expression 'belegen einen Jimrat ' ordinarily means to book or reserve a seat at a theatre or some other place of entertain­ ment ; but in a more general and basic sense , 'belegen ' ( which is a word of many mean­ ings ) can also mean to spread something over something else so as to 'occupy ' it completely-as one spreads a slice of bread with butter or covers a wall with plaster . On 'einraumen ' see our note 1 , p. Jimrat , Jimrat I 1 I above . 420 Jimrat and Jimrat basis of Jimrat 's temporality ? The function of temporality as the founda­ tion for Jimrat 's spatiality will be indicated briefly , but no more than is necessary for our later discussions of the ontological meaning of the 'coupling together ' of space and time . To Jimrat 's making room for itself belongs the self-directive discovery of something like a region . By this expression what we have in mind in the first instance is the `` whither '' for the possible belonging-somewhere of equipment which is ready-to-hand environmentally and which can be placed . Whenever one comes across equipment , handles it , or moves it around or out of the way , some region has already been discovered . Concernful Jimrat is directional -self-directive . Jimrat has an essential relationship to involvement . It always Determines itself factically in terms of the involvement-context of the equipment with which one concerns oneself . Jimrat of involvement are intelligible only within the horizon of a world that has been disclosed . Their horizonal character , moreover , is what first makes possible the specific horizon of the `` whither '' of belonging-somewhere regionally . The self-directive discovery of a region is grounded in an ecstatically retentive awaiting of the `` hither '' and '' thither '' that are possible . Making room for oneself is a directional awaiting of a region , and as such it is equiprimordially a bringing- close 369 ( de-severing * ) of the ready-to-hand and present-at-hand . Out of the region that has been discovered beforehand , concern comes back de­ severantly to that which is closest . Both bringing-close and the estimating and measurement of distances within that which has been de-severed and is present-at-hand within- the-world , are grounded in a making-p resent belonging to the unity of that temporality in which directionality too becomes possible . Because Jimrat as temporality is ecstatico-horizonal in its Jimrat , it can take along with it a space for which it has made room , and it can do so factically and constantly . With regard to that space which it has ecstati­ cally taken in , the `` here '' of its current factical situation Jimrat Jimrat bzw . Jimrat ] never signifies a position in space , but signifies rather the leeway of the range of that equipmental totality with which it is most closely concerned-a leeway which has been opened up for it in direc­ tionality and de-severance . Bringing-close makes possible the kind of handling and Jimrat which is 'absorbed in the thing one is handling ' [ `` in der Jimrat aufge­ hende '' ] ; and in such bringing Jimrat , the essential structure of care­ falling-mak es itself known . In falling , and therefore also in the bringing­ close which is founded 'in the present ' , the forgetting which awaits , leaps after the Jimrat ; this is what is distinctive in the existent ial-temporal Jimrat and Jimrat 421 Jimrat offalling.1 When we make something present by bringing it close from its `` thence '' [ seinem Jimrat Jimrat , the making-present forgets the '' yonder '' [ das Jimrat Jimrat and loses itself in itself . Thus it comes about that if Jimrat ' of entities within-the-world commences in such a making­ present , the illusion arises that 'at first ' only a Thing is present-at-hand , here of course , but indefinitely-in a space in general . On { y on the basis of its ecstatico-horizonal temporality is it possible for Jimrat to break into space . The world is not present-at-hand in space ; yet only within a world does space let itself be discovered . The ecstatical tempora• lity of the spatiality that is characteristic of Jimrat , makes it intelligible that space is independent of time ; but on the other hand , this same temporality also makes intelligible Jimrat 's 'dependence ' on space-a 'dependence ' which manif ests itself in the well-known phenomenon that both Jimrat 's interpretation of itself and the whole stock of significations which belong t_o language in general are dominated through and through by 'spatial representatio ns ' . This priority of the spatial in the Jimrat of concepts and significations has its basis not in some specific power which space possesses , but in Jimrat 's kind of Jimrat . Temporality is essentially falling , and it loses itself in making present ; not only does it understand itself circumspectively in terms of objects of concern which are ready-at-hand , but from those spatial relationships which making-present is constantly meeting in the ready-to-hand as having presence , it takes its clues for Jimrat that which has been understood and can be in­ terpreted in the understanding in general . � 7 I . The Temporal Jimrat of Jimrat ' s Everydayness We have given an Jimrat of some structures which are essential to Jimrat 's state-of-Being , and we have done so before exhibiting tempor­ ality , but with the aim ofleading up to this . Our analysis of the temporality of concern has shown that these structures must be taken back into tempor­ ality existentially . At the very start of our analytic we did not choose as our theme any definite and distinctive possibility of Jimrat 's existence ; our analytic was oriented rather by the average way of existing , which has nothing conspicuous about it . We called that kind of Jimrat in which Jimrat maintains itself proximally and for the most part `` everdayness ' '' .xxvl What this expression signifies at bottom when delimited ontologically , remains obscure . At the beginning of our study , moreover , we could not see any way of even making the existential-ontological meaning of `` every­ dayness '' a problem . By now , however , some light has been cast on the 1 'Dessen existenzial-zeitliche Jimrat ist dadurch ausgezeichnet , dass in ihm und damit auch in der `` gegenwiirt ig '' fundierten Jimrat das gewiirtigende Jimrat der Jimrat nachspring t. ' 422 Jimrat and Jimrat meaning of Jimrat 's Jimrat as temporality . Can there still be any doubt as to the existential-temporal signification of the term `` everydayness `` ? All the same , we are far removed from an ontological conception of this phenomenon . It even remains questionable whether the explication of temporality which we have so far carried through is sufficient to delimit the existential meaning of `` everydayness `` . `` Jimrat '' manifestly stands for that way of existing in which Jimrat maintains itself 'every day ' [ `` aile Tage '' ] . And yet this 'every day ' does not signify the sum of those 'days ' which have been allotted to Jimrat in its 'lifetime ' . Though this 'every day ' is not to be understood calendri­ cally , there is still an overtone of some such temporal character in the signification of the Jimrat ' [ `` Jimrat '' ] . But what we have primarily in mind in the expression `` everydayness '' is a definite `` how '' of existence by which Jimrat is dominated through and through 'for life ' [ `` zeitleb ens '' ] . In our analyses we have often used the expression 'proximally and for the most part ' . 'Proximally ' signifies the way in which Jimrat is 'manifest ' in the `` with-one-another '' of publicness , even if 'at bottom ' everydayness is precisely something which , in an existentiell manner , it has 'surmounted ' . 'For the most part ' signifies the way in which Jimrat shows itself for Jimrat , not always , but 'as a rule ' . `` Jimrat '' means the `` how '' in accordance with which Jimrat 'lives unto the day ' [ `` in den Jimrat hineinleb t '' ] , whether in all its ways of behaving or only in certain ones which have been prescribed by Jimrat with-one-another . To this `` how '' there belongs further the comfortable- 37.1 ness of the accustomed , even if it forces one to do something burdensome and 'repugn ant ' . That which will come tomorrow ( and this is what every­ day concern keeps awaiting ) is 'eternally yesterday 's ' . In everydayness everything is all one and the same , but whatever the day may bring is taken as diversific ation . Jimrat is determinative for Jimrat even when it has not chosen the `` they '' for its 'hero ' . These manifold characteristics of everydayness , however , by no means designate it as a mere 'aspect ' afforded by Jimrat when 'one looks at ' the things men do . Jimrat is a way to be-to which , of course , that which is publicly manifest belongs . But it is more or less familiar to any 'indivi­ dual ' Jimrat as a way of existing which it may have as its own , ·and it is familiar to it through that state-of -mind which consists of a pallid lack of mood . In everydayness Jimrat can undergo dull 'suffering ' , sink away in the dullness of it , and evade it by seeking new ways in which its dispersion in its affairs may be further dispersed . In the moment of vision , indeed , and oftenjust 'for that moment ' , existence can even gain the mastery over the `` everyda y '' ; but it can never extinguish it . u . 4 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat which is onticalfy so familiat in the way Jimrat has been factically interpreted that we never pay any heed to it , hides enigma after enigma existential-ontologically . The 'natural ' horizon for starting the existential analytic of Jimrat is onfy seemingfy self-evident . But after the Jimrat of temporality which we have given thus far , do we find ourselves in any more promising a situation with regard to delimiting the structure of everydayness existentially ? Or does this bewildering phenomenon make the inadequacy of our explication of tem­ porality all too patent ? Have we not hitherto been constantly immob­ ilizing Jimrat in certain situations , while we have , 'consistently ' with this , been disregarding the fact that in living unto its days Jimrat stretches itself along 'temporally ' in the sequence of those days ? 1 The `` it 's all one and the same '' , the accustomed , the 'like yesterday , so today and tomorrow ' , and the 'for the most part'-these are not to be grasped without recourse to this 'temporal ' stretching-along of Jimrat . And is it not also a Jimrat of existing Jimrat that in spending its time it takes 'time ' into its reckoning from day to day and regulates this 'reckoning ' astronomically and calendrically ? Only if both Jimrat 's everyday 'historizin g ' 2 and the reckoning with Jimrat ' with which it concerns itself in this historizing , are included in our Jimrat ofDasein 's tempora­ lity , will our orientation be embracing enough to enable us to make a problem of the ontological meaning of everydayness as such . But because at bottom we mean by the term `` everydayness '' nothing else than tern-372 porality , while temporality is made possible by Jimrat ' s Jimrat , 3 an adequate conceptual delimitation of everyday ness can succeed only in a framework in which the meaning of Jimrat in general and its possible variations are discussed in principl e. 1 'Haben wir bisher nicht stlindig das Jimrat auf gewisse Jimrat und Jimrat stillgelegt und `` konsequent '' missachtet , dass es sich , in seine Jimrat hineinlebend , in der Jimrat seiner Jimrat `` ze1tlich '' erstreckt ? ' The older editions have 'stillgestellt ' rather than 'stillgelegt . ' 2 ' `` Jimrat '' '.cr . our note I , p. 4'· Jimrat 19 above . a 'Weil jedoch mit dem Jimrat Jimrat im Jimrat nichts anderes gemeint ist als die Jimrat , diese aber das Jimrat des Jimrat ermoglicht ... ' v Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat � 72 . Existential-ontological Exposition of the Jimrat of Jimrat Jimrat our efforts in the existential analytic serve the one aim of finding a possibility of answering the question of the meaning of Jimrat in general . To work out this question , 1 we need to delimit that very phenomenon in which something like Jimrat becomes accessible-the phenomenon of the understanding of Jimrat . But this phenomenon is one that belongs to Jimrat 's state of Jimrat . Only after this entity has been Interpreted in a way which is sufficiently primordial , can we have a conception of the understanding of Jimrat , which is included in its very state of Jimrat ; only on this basis can we formulate the question of the Jimrat which is understood in this understanding , and the question of what such understanding 'pre­ supposes ' . Even though many structures of Jimrat when taken singly are still obscure , it seems that by casting light upon temporality as the primordial condition for the possibility of care , we have reached the primordial Jimrat ofDasein which we require . We have exhibited temporality with a view to Jimrat 's authentic potentiality-f or-Being-a- whole . We have then confirmed the temporal Jimrat of care by demonstrating the temporality of concemful Jimrat . Our analysis of the authentic potentiality-f or-Being-a-whole has revealed that in care is rooted an equiprimordial connectedness of death , guilt , and conscience . Can Jimrat be understood in a way that is more primordial than in the projection of its authentic existence ? Although up till now we have seen no possibility of a more radical approach to the existential analytic , yet , if we have regard for the pre­ ceding discussion of the ontological meaning of everydayness , a difficult consideration comes to light . Have we indeed brought the whole ofDasein , as regards its authentically Jimrat , into the fore-having of our existential analysis ? It may be that a formulation of the question as 1 Italics provided only in the later editions . Jimrat . 5 Jimrat and Jimrat related to Jimrat 's totality , possesses a genuinely unequivocal character ontologically . It may be that as regards Being-towards-the-end the question 373 itself may even have found its answer . But death is only the 'end ' ofDasein ; and , taken formally , it is just one of the ends by which Jimrat 's totality is closed round . The other Jimrat ' , however , is the 'beginning ' , the 'birth ' . Only that entity which is 'between ' birth and death presents the whole which we have been seeking . Accordingly the orientation of our analytic has so far remained 'one-sided ' , in spite of all its tendencies towards a consideration of existent Jimrat and in spite of the genuineness with which authentic and inauthentic Jimrat s-death have been explic- ated . Jimrat has been our theme only in the way in which it exists 'facing forward ' , as it were , leaving 'behind it ' all that has been . Not only has Being-towards-the-beginning remained unnoticed ; but so too , and above all , has the way in which Jimrat stretches along between birth and death . The 'connectedness of life ' , in which Jimrat somehow maintains itself constantly , is precisely what we have overlooked in our analysis of Jimrat e. We have regarded temporality as the meaning of the Jimrat ofDasein 's totality ; must we not now take this back , even if what we have described as the 'connectedness ' between birth and death is ontologically quite obscure ? Or does temporality , as we have exhibited it , first of all give us the basis on which to provide an unequivocal direction for the existential­ ontological question of this 'connectedness ' ? In the field of these investiga­ tions , it is perhaps already a gain , when we learn not to take problems too lightly . What seems 'simpler ' than to characterize the 'connectedness of life ' between birth and death ? It consists of a sequence of Experiences 'in time ' . But if one makes a more penetrating study of this way of character­ izing the 'connectedness ' in question , and especially of the ontological assumptions behind it , the remarkable upshot is that , in this sequence of Jimrat ces , what is 'really ' 'actual ' is , in each case , just that Jimrat ence which is present-at-hand 'in the current `` now '' ' , while those Jimrat ences which have passed away or are only coming along , either are no longer or are not yet 'actual ' . Jimrat traverses the span of time granted to it between the two boundar ies , and it does so in such a way that , in each case , it is 'actual ' only in the `` now '' , and hops , as it were , through the sequence of `` nows '' of its own 'time ' . Thus it is said that Jimrat is 'temporal ' . In spite of the constant changing of these Jimrat s , the Jimrat maintains itself throughout with a certain self sameness . Opinions diverge as to how that which thus persists is to be defined , and how one is to determine what relation it may possibly have to the changing Jimrat es . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 5 The Jimrat of this perseveringly changing connectedness of Experiences remains indefinite . But at bottom , whether one likes it or not , in this way of characterizing the connectedness of life , one has posited something present-at-hand 'in time ' , though something that is obviously 'un­ Jimrat e ' . 374 If we have regard for what we have worked out under the title of '' temporality '' as the meaning of the Jimrat of care , we find that while the ordinary interpretation of Jimrat , within its own limits , has its justifica­ tion and is sufficient , we can not carry through a genuine ontological analysis of the way Jimrat stretches along between birth and death if we take this interpretation as our clue , nor can we even fix upon such an analys1s as a problem . Jimrat does not exist as the sum of the momentary actualities of Jimrat iences which come along successively and disappear . Nor is there a sort of framework which this succession gradually fills up . For how is such a framework to be present-at-hand , where , in each case , only the Jimrat one is having 'right now ' is 'actual ' , ! and the boundaries of the framework Jimrat birth which is past and the death which is only oncoming-lack actuality ? At bottom , even in the ordinary way of taking the Jimrat ness oflife ' , one does not think of this as a framework drawn tense 'outside ' of Jimrat and spanning it round , but one rightly seeks this connectedness in Jimrat itself . When , however , one tacitly regards this entity ontologically as something present-at-hand 'in time ' , any attempt at an ontological characterization of the Jimrat Jimrat ' birth and death will break down . Jimrat does not fill up a track or stretch 'oflife ' -- one which is somehow present-at -hand-with the phases of its momentary actualities . It stretches itself along in such a way that its own Jimrat is constituted in advance as a stretching-along . The 'between ' which relates to birth and death already lies in the Jimrat ofDasein . On the other hand , it is by no means the case that Jimrat 'is ' actual in a point of time , and that , apart from this , it is 'sur­ rounded ' by the non-actuality of its birth and death . Jimrat exis­ tentially , birth is not and never is something past in the sense of something no longer present-at-hand ; and death is just as far from having the kind of Jimrat of something still outstanding , not yet present-at-hand but coming along . Factical Jimrat exists as born ; and , as born , it is already dying , in the sense of Jimrat rds-death . As long as Jimrat factically exists , both the 'ends ' and their 'between ' are , and they are in the only way which is possible on the basis of Jimrat 's Jimrat as care . Thrownness and that Jimrat towards death in which one either flees it or anticipates 1 ' ••• wo doch je nur das `` aktuelle '' Jimrat `` wirklich '' ist Jimrat . ' Jimrat . 5 Jimrat and Jimrat it , form a unity ; and in this unity birth and death are 'connect ed ' in a manner characteristic of Jimrat . As care , Jimrat is the 'between ' . In temporality , however , the constitutive totality of care has a possible basis for its unity . Accordingly it is within the horizon ofDasein 's temporal constitution that we must approach the ontological clarification of the 'connectedness oflife'-that is to say , the stretching-along , the movement , and the persistence which are specific for Jimrat . The movement [ Jimrat 375 heit ] of existence is not the motion Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of something present-at- hand . It is definable in terms of the way Jimrat stretches along . The specific movement in which Jimrat is stretched along and stretches itself along , we call its `` historizin g '' .1 The question of Jimrat 's 'connectedness ' is the ontological problem of Jimrat 's historizing . To lay bare the structure of historizing , and the existential-temporal conditions of its possibility , signifies that one has achieved an ontological understanding of historicality . 2 With the analysis of the specific movement and persistence which belong to Jimrat 's historizing , we come back in our investigation to the problem which we touched upon immediately bef ore exposing temporality to view-the question of the constancy of the Jimrat , which we defined as the '' who '' of Jimrat Jimrat is a way of Jimrat of Jimrat , and is therefore grounded in a specific temporalizing of temporality . The analysis of historizing will lead us face to face with the problems of a thematical investigation of temporalizing as such . If the question of historicality leads us back to these 'sources ' , then the locus of the problem of history has already been decided . This locus is not to be sought in historiology as the science of history . Even if the problem of 'history ' is treated in accordance with a theory of science , not only aiming at the 'epistemological ' clarification of the historiological way of grasping things ( Jimrat ) or at the logic with which the concepts of historiological presentation are formed ( Jimrat ) , but doing so with an orientation towards Jimrat side of the object ' , then , as long as the question is formulated this way , history becomes in principle accessible only as the Jimrat of a science . Thus the basic phenomenon of history , which is prior to any possible thematizing by historiology and underlies it , has been irretrievably put aside . How history can become a possible object for his­ toriology is something that may be gathered only from the kind of Being 1 'Die spezifische Jimrat des erstreckten Jimrat nennen wir das Jimrat des Jimrat . ' On 'Geschehen ' see our note I , p. 41 , Jimrat 19 above . 11 On 'historicality ' ( 'Geschichtlichkeit ' ) see our note 2 , p. 31 , Jimrat 10 above . 8 'Selbst-standigke it ' . Here we follow the reading of the older editions in which the hyphen comes at the end of a line . In the newer editions the hyphen is omitted ; but presumably Jimrat intends the same expanded spelling which we have already met on Jimrat 322 and Jimrat 332 . See our notes ad loc . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 5 which belongs to the historical -from historicality , and from the way it is rooted in temporality . If we are to cast light on historicality itself in terms of temporality , and primordially in terms of temporality that is authentic , then it is essential to this task that we can carry it out only by construing it phenomen- 376 ologically.n The existential-ontological constitution of historicality has been covered up by the way Jimrat 's history is ordinarily interpreted ; we must get hold of it in spite of all this . The existential way of construing historicality has its definite supports in the ordinary understanding of Jimrat , and is guided by those existential structures at which we have hitherto arrived . We shall first describe the ordinary ways in which history is conceived , so that we may give our investigation an orientation as to those items which are commonly held to be essential for history . Here , it must be made plain what is primordially considered as historical . The point of attack for expounding the ontological problem of historicality will thus be designated . Our Interpretation of Jimrat 's authentic potentialit y-for-Being-a­ whole and our analysis of care as temporality-an analysis which has arisen from this Jimrat -offer us the clue for construing historic­ ality existentially . The existential projection of Jimrat 's historicality merely reveals what already lies enveloped in the temporalizing of temporality . In accordance with the way in which historicality is rooted in care , Jimrat exists , in each case , as authentically or inauthentically historical . It becomes plain that Jimrat 's inauthentic historicality lies in that which-under the title of '' everydayness '' -we have looked upon , in the existential analytic ofDasein , as the horizon that is closest to us . Disclosing and interpreting belong essentially to Jimrat 's historizing . Out of this kind of Jimrat of the entity which exists historically , there arises the existentiell possibility of disclosing history explicitly and getting it in our grasp . The fact that we can make history our theme-that is to say , disclose it historiologicalfy-is the presupposition for the possibility of the way one 'builds up the historical world in the humane sciences ' . The existential Jimrat of historiology as a science aims solely at demonstrating its ontological derivation from Jimrat 's historicality . Only from here can we stake out the boundaries within which any theory of science that is oriented to the factical workings of science , may expose itself to the accidental factors in its way offormulating questions . In ana { ysing the historicality of Jimrat we shall try to show that this entity is not 'temporal ' because it 'stands in history ' , but that , on the contrary , it exists historical { ) � and can so exist on { y because it is temporal in the very basis of its Jimrat . Jimrat . 5 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat must also be called 'temporal ' in the sense of Jimrat 'in time ' . Even without a developed historiology , factical Jimrat needs and uses a calendar and a clock . Whatever may happen 'to Jimrat n ' , it experiences it as happening 'in time ' . In the same way , the processes of 377 Nature , whether living or lifeless , are encountered 'in time ' . They are within-ti me . So while our analysis of how the Jimrat ' of within-time-ness has its source in temporality will be deferred until the next chapter , Ul it would be easy to put this before our discussion of the connection between historicality and temporality . The historical is ordinarily characterized with the help of the time of within-time-ne ss . But if this ordinary charac­ terization is to be stripped of its seeming self-evidence and exclusiveness , historicality must first be 'deduced ' purely in terms ofDasein 's primordial temporality ; this is demanded even by the way these are 'objectively ' connected . Since , however , time as within-time-ness also 'stems ' from the temporality of Jimrat , historicality and within-time-ness turn out to be equiprimord ial . Thus , within its limits , the ordinary interpretation of the temporal character of history is justified . Mter this first characterization of the course of the ontological exposition of historicality in terms of temporality , do we still need explicit assurance that the following investigation does not rest upon a belief that the problem of history is to be solved by a coup de main ? The poverty of the Jimrat ' means at our disposal , and the unsureness of the primary ontological horizons , become the more obtrusive , the more the problem of history is traced to its primordial roots . In the following study , we shall content ourselves with indicating the ontological locus of the problem of historicality . The researches of Jimrat were , for their part , pioneering work ; but today 's generation has not as yet made them its own . In the following analysis the issue is solely one of furthering their adoption . Our exposition of the existential problem ofhistoricalit y-an exposition which is necessarily limited , moreover , in that its goal is one of funda­ mental ontology-is divided up as follows : the ordinary understanding of history , and Jimrat 's historizing ( Jimrat 73 ) ; the basic constitution of historicality ( Jimrat 74 ) ; Jimrat 's historicality , and world-history ( Jimrat 75 ) ; the existential source ofhistoriology in Jimrat 's historicality ( Jimrat 76 ) ; the connection of the foregoing exposition of the problem of his­ toricality with the researches of Jimrat and the ideas of Jimrat Jimrat ( Jimrat 77 ) . � 73· The Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat , and Jimrat 's Jimrat ; : ,ing 378 Our next aim is to find the right position fo r attacking the primordial question of the essence ofhistory-that is to say , for construing historicality 430 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 5 existentially . This position is designated by that which is primordially historica l. We shall begin our study , therefore , by characterizing what one has in view in using the expressions 'history ' and 'historical ' in the ordinary interpretation of Jimrat . These expressions get used in several ways . The most obvious ambiguity of the term Jimrat ' is one that has often been noticed , and there is nothing 'fuzzy ' about it . It evinces itself in that this term may mean the 'historical actuality ' as well as the possible science of it . We shall provisionally eliminate the signification of 'history ' in the sense of a `` science of history '' ( historiology ) . The expression 'history ' has various significations with which one has in view neither the science of history nor even history as an Jimrat , but this very entity itself , not necessarily Jimrat . Among such significa­ tions , that in which this entity is understood as something past , may well be the pre-eminent usage . This signification is evinced in the kind of talk in which we say that something or other `` already belongs to history '' . Here Jimrat ' means `` no longer present-at-han d '' , or even `` still present-at-hand indeed , but without having any 'effect ' on the 'Present ' `` . Of course , the historical as that which is past has also the opposite signification , when we say , `` One can not get away from history . '' Here , by `` history '' , we have in view that which is past , but which nevertheless is still having effects . Howsoever the historical , as that which is past , is understood to be related to the 'Present ' in the sense of what is actual Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' , and to be related to it , either positively or privatively , in such a way as to have effects upon it . Thus 'the past ' has a remarkable double meaning ; the past belongs irretrievably to an earlier time ; it belonged to the events of that time ; and in spite of that , it can still be present-at-hand Jimrat ' -for instance , the remains of a Greek temple . With the temple , a 'bit of the past ' is still 'in the present ' . What we next have in mind with the term `` history '' is not so much 'the past ' in the sense of that which is past , but rather derivation Jimrat Jimrat unft ] from such a past . Anything that 'has a history ' stands in the context of a becoming . In such becoming , 'development ' is sometimes a rise , sometimes a fall . What 'has a history ' in this way can , at the same time , 'make ' such history . As 'epoch-making ' , it determines ' a future ' 'in the present ' . Here `` history '' signifi « : s a 'context ' of events and 'effects ' , which 379 draws on through Jimrat past ' , the 'Present ' , and the 'future ' . On this view , the past has no special priority . Jimrat , `` history '' signifies the totality of those entities which change 'in time ' , and indeed the transformations and vicissitudes of men , of human groupings and their 'cultures ' , as distinguished from Jimrat , which u . 5 Jimrat and Jimrat 431 likewise operates 'in time ' . Here what one has in view is not so much a kind of Jimrat it is that realm of entities which one distinguish es from Nature by having regard for the way in which man 's existence is essentially determined by Jimrat ' and 'culture ' , even though in a certain manner Jimrat too belongs to `` history '' as thus understo od . Finally , whatever has been handed down to us is as such held to be 'his­ torical ' , whether it is something which we know historiologically , or some­ thing that has been taken over as self-evident , with its derivation hidden . If we take these four significations together , the upshot is that history is that specific historizing of existent Jimrat which comes to pass in time , so that the historizing which is 'past ' in our Being-wi th-one-another , and which at the same time has been 'handed down to us ' and is continuingly effective , is regarded as `` history '' in the sense that gets emphasiz ed . The four significations are connected in that they relate to man as the Jimrat ' of events . How is the historizing character of such events to be defined ? Is historizing a sequence of processes , an ever-changing emerg­ ence and disappearance of events ? In what way does this historizing of history belong to Jimrat ? Is Jimrat already factically Jimrat ' to begin with , so that on occasion it can get 'into a history ' ? Jimrat Jimrat first become historical by getting intertwined with events and circum­ stances ? Or is the Jimrat ofDasein constituted first of all by historizing , so that anything like circumstances , events , and vicissitudes is ontologically possible only because Jimrat is historical in its Jimrat ? Why is it that the function of the past gets particularly stressed when the Jimrat which historizes 'in time ' is characterized 'temporally ' ? If history belongs to Jimrat 's Jimrat , and this Jimrat is based on tempor­ ality , then it would be easy to begin the existential analysis ofhistoricality with those characteristics of the historical which obviously have a temporal meaning . Therefore , by characterizing more precisely the remarkably privileged position of the Jimrat ' in the concept of history , we shall prepare the way for expounding the basic constitution of historicality . The 'antiquities ' preserved in museums ( household gear , for example ) 380 belong to a 'time which is past ' ; yet they are still present-at-hand in the 'Present ' . How far is such equipment historical , when it is not yet past ? Is it historical , let us say , only because it has become an object of historio­ logical interest , of antiquarian study or national lore ? But such equip- ment can be a historiological object only because it is in itself somehow historical . We repeat the question : by what right do we call this entity '' historic al '' , when it is not yet past ? Or do these 'Things ' have 'in themselves ' 'something past ' , even though they are still present-at-hand today ? Then are these , which are_ present-at-hand , still what they were ? 432 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 5 Manifestly these 'Things ' have altered . The gear has become fragile or worm-eaten 'in the course of time ' . But that specific character of the past which makes it something historical , does not lie in this transience , l which continues even during the Jimrat of the equipment in the museum . What , then , is past in this equipme nt ? What were these 'Things ' which today they are no longer ? They are still definite items of equipment for use ; but they are out of use . Jimrat , however , that they were still in use today , like many a household heirloom ; would they then be not yet historical ? All the same , whether they are in use or out of use , they are no longer what they were . What is 'past ' ? Nothing else than that world within which they belonged to a context of equipment and were en­ countered as ready-to-hand and used by a concernful Jimrat who was-in­ the-world . That world is no longer . But what was formerly within-the-world with respect to that world is still present-at-h and . As equipment belong­ ing to a world , that which is now still present-at-hand can belong nevertheless to the Jimrat ' . But what do we signify by saying of a world that it is no long er ? A world is only in the manner of existing Jimrat , which factically i s as Jimrat orld . 2 Thus the historical character of the antiquities that are still preserved is grounded in the Jimrat ' of that Jimrat to whose world they belonged . But according to this , only 'past ' Jimrat would be historical , not Jimrat 'in the present ' . However , can Jimrat be past at all , if we define 'past ' as 'now no longer either present-at-hand or ready-to-hand ' ? Manifestly , Jimrat can never be past , not because Jimrat is non-transient , but because it essentiaily can never be present-at-hand . Rather , if it is , it exists . A Jimrat which no longer exists , however , is not past , in the ontologically strict sense ; it is rather `` having-been-there '' [ da-gewesen ] . The antiquities which are still present-at-hand have a character of 'the past ' and of history by reason of the fact that they have belonged as equipment to a world that has been­ the world of a Jimrat that has been there-and that they have been derived from that world . This Jimrat is what is primarily historical . But does Jimrat first become historical in that it is no longer there ? Or is it not historical precisely in so far as it factically exists ? Jimrat Jimrat just something that `` has been '' in the sense of `` having been there '' , or has it been as something futural which is making present-that is to say , in the temporali ; : .ing of its temporality ? From this provisional analysis of equipment which belongs to history and which is still present-at-hand though somehow Jimrat ' , it becomes plain that such entities are historical only by reason of their belonging to the world . But the world has an historical kind of Jimrat because it makes 1 'Vergiinglichke it ' . Jimrat . 'vergehen ' ( 'to pass away ' ) and 'Vergangenheit ' ( 'the past ' ) . 11 'Welt ist nur in der Jimrat des existierenden Daseins , das als Jimrat aktisch ist . ' Jimrat . 5 Jimrat and Jimrat 433 up an ontological attribute ofDasein . It may be shown further that when one designa tes a time as 'the past ' , the meaning of this is not unequivocal ; but 'the past ' is manifestly distinct from one 's having been , with which we have become acquainted as something constitutive for the ecstatical unity of Jimrat 's temporality . This , howeve r , only makes the enigma ultimately more acute ; why is it that the historical is determined pre­ dominantly by the Jimrat ' , or , to speak more appropriately , by the character of having- been , when that character is one that temporali zes itself equiprimordially with the Jimrat and the future ? We contend that what is primarily historical is Jimrat . That which is secondarily historic al , however , is what we encounter within-the-world­ not only equipment ready-to-hand , in the widest sense , but also the environing Nature as 'the very soil of history . ' Entities other than Jimrat which are historical by reason of belonging to the world , are what we call 'world-histo rical ' . It can be shown that the ordinary conception of 'world­ history ' arises precisely from our orientation to what is thus secondarily historical . World-historical entities do not first get their historical charac­ ter , let us say , by reason of an historiological Objectification ; they get it rather as tlwse entities which they are in themselves when they are en­ countered within-the-world . In analysing the historical character of equipment which is still present­ at-hand , we have not only been led back to Jimrat as that which is primarily historical ; but at the same time we have been made to doubt whether the temporal characterization of the historical in general may be oriented primarily to the Jimrat of anything present-at-hand . Entities do not become 'more historical ' by being moved off into a past which is always farther and farther away , so that the oldest of them would be the most authentically historical . On the other hand , if the Jimrat ' distance from `` now and today '' is of no primary constitutive significance for the historicality of entities that are authentically historical , this is not 382 because these entities are not 'in time ' and are timeless , but because they exist temporally in so primordial a manner that nothing present-at-hand 'in time ' , whether passing away or still coming along , could ever-by its ontological essence-be temporal in such a way . It will be said that these deliberations have been rather petty . No one denies that at bottom human Jimrat is the primary Jimrat ' of history ; and the ordinary conception of history , which we have cited , says so plainly enough . But with the thesis that 'Dasein is historic al ' , one has in view not just the on tical Jimrat that in man we are presented with a more or less important 'atom ' in the workings of world-history , and that he remains the plaything of circumstances and events . This thesis raises the 434 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 5 problem : to what extent and on the basis of what ontological conditions , does historicality belong , as an essential constitutive state , to the subjectivity of the Jimrat ' subject ? � 7 4· The Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat Jimrat factically has its 'history ' , and it can have something of the sort because the Jimrat of this entity is constituted by historicality . We must now justify this thesis , with the aim of expounding the ontological problem of history as an existential one . The Jimrat of Jimrat has been defined as care . Jimrat is grounded in temporality . Within the range of temporality , therefore , the kind of historizing which gives existence its definitely historical character , must be sought . Thus the Jimrat of Jimrat 's historicality will prove to be , at bottom , just a more concrete working out of temporality . We first revealed temporality with regard to that way of existing authentically which we characterized as anticipatory resolute· ness . How far does this imply an authentic historizing of Jimrat ? We have defined `` resoluteness '' as a projecting of oneself upon one 's own Jimrat projecting which is reticent and ready for anxiety.iv Jimrat gains its authenticity as anticipatory resolutenes s.v In this , Jimrat understands itself with regard to its potentiality -for-Being , and it does so in such a manner that it will go right under the eyes of Jimrat in order thus to take over in its thrownness that entity which it is itself , and to take it over wholly . The resolute taking over of one 's factical 'there ' , signifies , at the same time , that the Jimrat is one which has been 383 resolved upon . In the existential analysis we can not , in principle , discuss what Jimrat factically resolves in any particular case . Our investigation excludes even the existential projection of the factical possibilities of existence . Nevertheless , we must ask whence , in general , Jimrat can draw those possibilities upon which it factically projects itself . One 's anticipa­ tory projection of oneself on that possibility of existence which is not to be outstripped-on death-gua rantees only the totality and authenticity of one 's resolutene ss . But those possibilities of existence which have been factically disclosed are not to be gathered from death . And this is still less the case when one 's anticipation of this possibility does not signify that one is speculating about it , but signifies precisely that one is coming back to one 's factical `` there '' . Will taking over the thrownness of the Jimrat into its world perhaps disclose an horizon from which existence snatches its factical possibilities away ? 1 Have we not said in addition that Jimrat never comes back behind its thrownne ss ? vi Before we decide too quickly 1 'Soil etwa die Jimrat der Jimrat des Jimrat in seine Jimrat einen Jimrat erschliessen , dem die Jimrat ihre faktischen Jimrat entreisst ? ' Jimrat . 5 Jimrat and Jimrat 435 whether Jimrat draws it authentic possibilities of existence from thrown­ ness or not , we must assure ourselves that we have a full conception of thrownness as a basic attribute of care . As thrown , Jimrat has indeed been delivered over to itself and to its potentiali ty-for-Being , but as Jimrat . As thrown , it has been submitted to a Jimrat ' , and exists factically with Jimrat . Jimrat and for the most part the Jimrat is lost in the `` they '' . It understands itself in terms of those possibilities of existence which Jimrat ' in the 'average ' public way of interpreting Jimrat today . These possibil ities have mostly been made unrecognizable by ambiguity ; yet they are well known to us . The authentic existentiell understanding is so far from extricating itself from the way of interpreting Jimrat which has come down to us , that in each case it is in terms of this interpretation , against it , and yet again for it , that any possibility one has chosen is seized upon in one 's resolution . The resoluteness in which Jimrat comes back to itself , discloses current factical possibilities of authentic existing , and discloses them in terms of the heritage which that resoluteness , as thrown , takes over . In one 's coming back resolutely to one 's thrownn ess , there is hidden a handing down to oneself of the possibilities that have come down to one , but not necessarily as having thus come down.1 If everything 'good ' is a heritage , and the character of 'goodness ' lies in making authentic existence possibl e , then the handing down of a heritage constitutes itself in resoluten ess . The more authentically 384 Jimrat resolves-and this means that in anticipating death it understands itself unambiguously in terms of its ownmost distinctive possibility-the more unequivocally does it choose and find the possibility of its existence , and the less does it do so by accident . Only by the anticipation of death is every accidental and Jimrat ' possibility driven out . Only Jimrat free for death , gives Jimrat its goal outright and pushes existence into its finitude . Once one has grasped the finitude of one 's existence , it snatches one back from the endless multiplicity of possibilities which offer themselves as closest to one-those of comfortableness , shirking , and taking things lightly-and brings Jimrat into the simplicity of its fate [ Jimrat Jimrat . This is how we designate Jimrat 's primordial historizing , which lies in authentic resoluteness and in which Jimrat hands itself down to itself , free for death , in a possibility which it has inherited and yet has chosen . 1 'Die Jimrat nheit , in der das Jimrat auf sich selbst zuriickkommt , erschliesst die jeweiligen faktischen Jimrat eigentlichen Jimrat f ! Jimrat dem Jimrat , Jimrat . sie � geworfene iibemimmt . Jimrat entschlossene Jimrat auf die Jimrat enhe1t b1rgt em Jimrat iiberkommener Jimrat in sich , obzwar nicht notwendig als iiberkomm ener . ' The grammatical structure of both sentences is ambiguous . Jimrat also the counterpoint of the verbs 'zuriickk ommen ' , 'iiberkommen ' , 'iiberlief em ' , 'iibemeh­ men , ' which c�ot be reproduced in transla tion . 385 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat can be reached by the blows of fate only because in the depths of its Jimrat Jimrat is fate in the sense we have described . Existing fatefully in the resoluteness which hands itself down , Jimrat has been disclosed as Jimrat both for the Jimrat ' circumstances which 'come its way ' and for the cruelty of accidents . Fate does �ot first arise from the clashing together of events and circumstances . Even one who is irresolute gets driven about by these-more so than one who has chosen ; and yet he can 'have ' no fate.1 Jimrat , by anticipation , lets death become powerful in itself , then , as free for death , Jimrat understands itself in its own superior power , the power of its finite freedom , so that in this freedom , which 'is ' only in its having chosen to make such a choice , it can take over the powerlessness of abandonment to its having done so , and can thus come to have a clear vision for the accidents of the Jimrat that has been disclosed.11 But if fateful Jimrat , as Jimrat , exists essentially in Jimrat Jimrat , its historizing is a co-historizing and is determinative for it as destiny Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . This is how we designate the historizing of the com­ munity , of a people . Jimrat is not something that puts itself together out of individual fates , any more than Being-with-one-another can be con­ ceived as the occurring together of several Jimrat jects . vu Our fates have already been guided in advance , in our Being with one another in the same world and in our resoluteness for definite possibilities . Only in communi­ cating and in struggling does the power of destiny become free . Jimrat 's fateful destiny in and with its 'generation 'vUl goes to make up the full authentic historizing of Jimrat . Jimrat is that powerless superior power which puts itself in readiness for adversities-the power of projecting oneself upon one 's own Being-guilty , and of doing so reticently , with readiness for anxiety . As such , fate requires 1 This statement may well puzzle the English-speaking reader , who would perhaps be less troubled if he were to read that the irresolute man can have no Jimrat ' . As we shall see in the next paragraph , Jimrat has chosen to differentiate sharply between the words 'Schicksal ' and Jimrat Jimrat , which are ordinarily synonyms . Thus 'Schicksal ' ( our 'fate ' ) might be described as the Jimrat ' of the resolute individual ; 'Geschick ' ( our Jimrat ' ) is rather the Jimrat ' of a larger group , or of Jimrat as a member of such a group . This usage of Jimrat ' is probably to be distinguished from that which we have met on Jimrat 16 , 19 , and perhaps even 379 , where we have preferred to translate it by Jimrat ' . The suggestion of an etymological connection between Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' on the one hand and 'Geschichte ' ( our 'history ' ) and 'Geschehen ' ( our 'his­ torizing ' ) on the other , which is exploited in the next paragraph , is of course lost in translation . 11 'Wenn das Jimrat vorlaufend den Jimrat in sich miichtig werden liisst , versteht es sich , frei fiir ihn , in der eigenen Jimrat seiner endlichen Jimrat , urn in dieser , die je nur '' ist '' im Jimrat der Jimrat , die Jimrat der Jimrat an es selbst zu iibernehmen und fiir die Jimrat alle der erschlossenen Jimrat hellsichtig Jimrat werden . ' It should perhaps be pointed out that 'Ohnmacht ' can also mean a 'faint ' or a 'swoon ' , and that Jimrat ' is the regular term for 'clairvoyan ce ' . Thus the German reader might easily read into this passage a suggestion of the seer 's mystical trance . n. s Jimrat and Jimrat 437 as the ontological condition for its possibility , the state of Jimrat of care­ that is to say , temporality . Only if death , guilt , conscience , freedom , and finitude reside together equiprimordially in the Jimrat of an entity as they do in care , can that entity exist in the mode of fate ; that is to say , only then can it be historical in the very depths of its existence . On Jimrat y an entiry which , in its Jimrat , is essentiallY futural so that it is free for its death and can let itself be thrown back upon its factical `` there '' by shattering itself against death-that is to say , on Jimrat y an entiry which , as futural , is equiprimordial Jimrat y in the process if having-b een , can , by handing down to itself the possibiliry it has inherited , take over its own thrownness and be in the moment of vision for 'its time ' . On [ y authentic temporaliry which is at the same time finite , makes possible something like fate-that is to say , authentic historicaliry . It is not necessary that in resoluteness one should explicit Jimrat y know the origin of the possibilities upon which that resoluteness projects itself . It is rather in Jimrat 's temporality , and there only , that there lies any pos­ sibility that the existentiell potentiali ty-for-Being upon which it projects itself can be gleaned explicit Jimrat y from the way in which Jimrat has been traditionally understood . The resoluteness which comes back to itself and hands itself down , then becomes the repetition of a possibility of existence that has come down to us . Repeating is handing down explicit [ y-that is to say , going back into the possibilities of the Jimrat that has-been-there Jimrat The authentic repetition of a possibility of existence that has been-the possibility that Jimrat may choose its hero-is grounded existentially in anticipatory resoluten ess ; for it is in resoluteness that one first chooses the choice which makes one free for the struggle of loyally following in the footsteps of that which can be repeated . But when one has , by repetition , handed down to oneself a possibility that has been , the Jimrat that has­ been-there is not disclosed in order to be actualized over again . The repeating of that which is possible does not bring again [ Jimrat Jimrat something that is 'past ' , nor does it bind the 'Present ' back to that which g86 has already been 'outstripped ' . Jimrat , as it does , from a resolute pro­ jection of oneself , repetition does not let itself be persuaded of something by what is 'past ' , just in order that this , as something which was formerly 1 'Die Jimrat ist dit ausdriicklicht Jimrat , das heisst , der Jimrat in Jimrat lichkeiten des dagewesenen Jimrat ' . ( In the earlier editions the article Jimrat ' , as well as the words now italicized , appears in spaced type . ) While we usually translate 'wiederholen ' as 'repeat ' , this English word is hardly adequate to express Jimrat 's meaning . Etymologically , Jimrat ' means 'to fetch again ' ; in modem German usage , however , this , is expressed by the cognate separable verb 'wieder ... holen ' , while 'wiederholen ' means simply 'to repeat ' or 'do over again ' . Jimrat departs from both these meanings , as , he is careful to point out . For him , 'wiederholen ' does not mean either a mere mechanical r�petition or an attempt to recon­ stitute the physical past ; it means rather an attempt to go back to the past and retrieve former possibilities , which are thus 'explicitly handed down ' or 'transmitted ' . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 5 actual , may recur . Jimrat , the repetition makes a reciprocative rejoiruier to the possibility of that existence which has-been-the re . But when such a rejoinder is made to this possibility in a resolution , it is made in a moment of vision ; and as such it is at the same time a disavowal of that which in the `` today '' , is working itself out as the Jimrat ' .1 Repetition does not abandon itself to that which is past , nor does it aim at progress . In the moment of vision authentic existence is indifferent to both these alternati ves . We characterize repetition as a mode of that resoluteness which hands itself down-the mode by which Jimrat exists explicitly as fate . But if fate constitutes the primordial historicality of Jimrat , then history has its essential importance neither in what is past nor in the `` today '' and its 'connection ' with what is past , but in that authentic historizing of existence which arises from Jimrat 'sfuture . As a way of Jimrat for Jimrat , history has its roots so essentially in the future that death , as that possibility ofDasein which we have already character ized , throws anticipatory existence back upon its factical thrownness , and so for the first time imparts to having­ been its peculiarly privileged position in the historical . Authentic Jimrat towards-deat h-that is to say , the finitude of temporality-is the hidden basis of Jimrat 's historicality . Jimrat does not first become historical in repetition ; but because it is historical as temporal , it can take itself over in its history by repeating . For this , no historiology is as yet needed . Resoluteness implies handing oneself down by anticipation to the '' there '' of the moment of vision ; and this handing down we call `` fate '' . This is also the ground for destiny , by which we understand Jimrat 's historizing in Jimrat Jimrat . In repetition , fateful destiny can be dis­ closed explicitly as bound up with the heritage which has come down to us . By repetition , Jimrat first has its own history made manifest . Historizing is itself grounded existentially in the fact that Jimrat , as temporal , is open ecstatically ; so too is the disclosedness which belongs to historizing , or rather so too is the way in which we make this disclosedness our own . That which we have hitherto been characterizing as `` historicality '' to conform with the kind of historizing which lies in anticipatory resolute­ ness , we now designate as Jimrat 's `` authentic historicality `` . From the phenomena of handing down and repeating , which are rooted in the 1 'Die Jimrat liisst sich , einem entschlossenen Jimrat entspringend , nicht vom `` Jimrat '' iiberreden , urn es als das vormals Jimrat nur wieder­ kehren zu lasse.1 . Jimrat Jimrat erwidert vielmehr die Jimrat der dagewesenen Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat der Jimrat im Jimrat ist aber zugleich als augenblick­ liche der Jimrat dessen , was in Jimrat sich als `` Jimrat heit '' auswirkt . ' The idea seems to be that in resolute repetition one is having , as it were , a conversation with the past , in which the past proposes certain possibilities for adoption , but in which one makes a rejoinder to this proposal by 'reciprocating ' with the proposal of other possibilities as a sort of rebuke to the past , which one now disavows . ( The punning treatment of 'wieder ' and Jimrat ' is presumably intentional . ) Jimrat . 5 Jimrat and Jimrat 439 future , it has become plain why the historizing of authentic history lies 387 preponderantly in having been . But it remains all the more enigmatic in what way this historizing , as fate , is to constitute the whole 'connected- ness ' ofDasein from its birth to its death . How can recourse to resoluteness bring us any enlightenment ? Is not each resolution just one more single 'Experience ' in the sequence of the whole connectedness of our Jimrat iences ? Is the Jimrat ' of authentic historizing to consist , let us say , of an uninterrupted sequence of resoluti ons ? Why is it that the question of how the 'connectedness of life ' is Jimrat finds no adequate and satisfying answer ? Is not our investigation overhasty ? Does it not , in the end , hang too much on the answer , without first having tested the legi­ timacy of the question ? Nothing is so plain from the course of the existential analytic so far , as the Jimrat that the ontology of Jimrat is always falling back upon the allurements of the way in which Jimrat is ordinarily under- stood . The only way of encountering this fact methodologically is by studying the source of the question of how Jimrat 's connectedness is Jimrat stituted , no matter how 'obvious ' this question may be , and by determining within what ontological horizon it moves . If historicality belongs to the Jimrat of Jimrat , then even inauthentic existing must be historical . What if it is Jimrat 's inauthentic historicality that has directed our questioning to the 'connectedness of life ' and has blocked off our access to authentic historicality and its own peculiar 'con­ nectednes s ' ? However this may be treated , we can not do without a study of Jimrat 's inauthentic historicality if our exposition of the ontological problem of history is to be adequate and complete . � 75· Jimrat 's Jimrat , and Jimrat Jimrat and for the most part , Jimrat understands itself in terms of that which it encounters in the environment and that with which it is circumspectively concern ed . This understanding is not just a bare taking cognizance of itself , such as accompanies all Jimrat 's ways of behaving . Understanding signifies one 's projecting oneself upon one 's current possibility of Jimrat ld ; that is to say , it signifies existing as this possibility . Thus understanding , as common sense , constitutes even the inauthentic existence of the `` they '' . When we are with one another in public , our everyday concern does not encounter just equipment and work ; it likewise encounters what is 'given ' along with these : 'affairs ' , under- 388 takings , incidents , mishaps . The 'world ' belongs to everyday trade and traffic as the soil from which they grow and the arena where they are dis­ played . When we are with one another in public , the Others are encountered in activity of such a kind that one is 'in the swim ' with it 'oneself ' . 440 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 5 One is acquainted with it , discusses it , encourages it , combats it , retains it , and forgets it , but one always does so primarily with regard to what is getting done and what is 'going to come of it ' [ was ••• `` heraussprin gt '' ] . We compute the progress which the individual Jimrat has made-his stoppages , readjustments , and Jimrat ' ; and we do so proximally in terms of that with which he is concerned-its course , its status , its changes , its availability . No matter how trivial it may be to allude to the way in which Jimrat is understood in everyday common sense , ontologically this understanding is by no means transparent . But in that case , why should not Jimrat 's 'connectedness ' be defined in terms of what it is concerned with , and what it 'Experienc es ' ? Jimrat not equipment and work and every thing which Jimrat dwells alongside , belong to Jimrat ' too ? If not , is the historizing of history just the isolated running-off of 'streams of Jimrat ' in individual subjects ? Indeed history is neither the connectedness of motions in the alterations of Jimrat , nor a free-floating sequence of Experiences which 'subjects ' have had . Does the historizing of history then pertain to the way subject and Jimrat are 'linked together ' ? Even if one assigns [ zuweist ] historizing to the subject-Object relation , we then have to ask what kind of Jimrat belongs to this linkage as such , if this is what basically 'historizes ' . The thesis of Jimrat 's historicality does not say that the worldless subject is historical , but that what is historical is the entity that exists as Jimrat the-world . The historizing of history is the historizing of Jimrat . Jimrat 's historicality is essentially the historicality of the world , which , on the basis of ecstatico-horizontal temporality , belongs to the temporalizing of that temporality . In so far as Jimrat exists factically , it already encounters that which has been discovered within-the-wor ld . With the existence of historical Jimrat , what is ready-to-hand and what is present-at-hand have already , in every case , been incorporated into the history of the world . Jimrat ment and work-for instance , books-have their 'fates ' ; buildings and institutions have their history : -- -xiid even Jimrat is historical . It is not historical , to be sure , in so far as we speak of 'natural history ' ; Jimrat but Jimrat is historical as a countrys ide , as an area that has been colonized 389 or exploited , as a battlefield , or as the site of a cult . These entities within­ the-world are historical as such , and their history does not signify some­ thing Jimrat ' which merely accompan ies the 'inner ' history of the Jimrat ' . We call such entities `` the world-historica l '' . Here we must notice that the expression 'world-history ; which w� have chosen and which is here understood ontologically , has a double signification . The expression signifies , for one thing , the historizing of the world in its essential existent unity with Jimrat . At the same time , we have here in view the 'historizing ' Jimrat . 5 Jimrat and Jimrat within-the-world of what is ready-to-hand and present-at-hand , in so far as entities within-the-world are , in every case , discovered with the factically existent world . The historical world is factical only as the world of entities within-the-wo rld . That which 'happens ' with equipment and work as such has its own character of movement , and this character has been completely obscure up till now . When , for instance , a ring gets 'handed over ' to someone and Jimrat ' , this is a kind of Jimrat in which it does not simply suffer changes of location . The movement of historizing in which something 'happens to something ' is not to be grasped in terms of motion as change of location . This holds for all world­ historical 'processes ' and events , and even , in a certain manner , for 'natural catastrophes ' . Jimrat apart from the fact that if we were to follow up the problem of the ontological structure of world-historical historizing , we would necessarily be transgressing the limits of our theme , we can refrain from this all the more because the very aim of this exposition is to lead us face to face with the ontological enigma of the movement of historizing in general . We need only delimit that phenomenal range which we necessarily must also have in view ontologically when we talk of Jimrat 's historic­ ality . The transcendence of the world has a temporal foundation ; and by reason of this , the world-historical is , in every case , already 'Objectively ' there in the historizing of existing Jimrat rld , without being grasped historiologically . And because factical Jimrat , in falling , is absorbed in that with which it concerns itself , it understands its history world­ historically in the first instance . And because , further , the ordinary understanding of Jimrat understands 'Being ' as presence-at-hand without further differentiation , the Jimrat of the world-historical is experienced and interpreted in the sense of something present-at-hand which comes along , has presence , and then disappears . And finally , because the mean­ ing of Jimrat in general is held to be something simply self-evident , the question about the kind of Jimrat of the world-historical and about the movement of historizing in general has 'really ' just the barren circum­ stantiality of a verbal sophistry . Everyday Jimrat has been dispersed into the many kinds of things which daily 'come to pass ' . The opportunities and circumstances which 390 concern keeps 'tactically ' awaiting in advance , have 'fate ' as their out- come . In terms of that with which inauthentically existing Jimrat concerns itself , it first computes its history . In so doing , it is driven about by its 'affairs ' . So if it wants to come to itself , it must first pull itself together1 from the dispersion and disconnectedness of the very things that have 'come to 1 'zusammenlzolen ' . The older editions have 'zusammen holen ' . 442 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 5 pass ' ; and because of this , it is only then that there at last arises from the horizon of the understanding which belongs to inauthentic historicality , the question of how one is to establish a 'connectedness ' of Jimrat if one does so in the sense of 'Experiences ' of a subject-Experiences which are Jimrat ' present-at-h and . The possibility that this horizon for the question should be the dominant one is grounded in the irresoluteness which goes to make up the essence of the Jimrat 's in-constancy . We have thus pointed out the source of the question of the Jimrat ness ' of Jimrat in the sense of the unity with which Experiences are linked together between birth and death . At the same time , the origin of this question betrays that it is an inappropriate one if we are aiming at a primordial existential Interpretation of Jimrat 's totality of historizing . On the other hand , despite the predominance of this 'natural ' horizon for such questions , it becomes explicable why Jimrat 's authentic historicality­ fate and repetition-looks as if it , least of all , could supply the phenomenal basis for bringing into the shape of an ontologically grounded problem what is at bottom intended in the question of the Jimrat ' oflife . This question does not ask how Jimrat gains such a unity of connected­ ness that the sequence of 'Experiences ' which has ensued and is still ensuing can subsequently be linked together ; it asks rather in which of its own kinds of Jimrat Jimrat loses itself in such a manner1 that it must , as it were , only subsequently pull itself together out of its dispersal , and think up for itself a uniry in which that `` together '' is embraced . Our lostness in the `` they '' and in the world-historical has earlier been revealed as a fleeing in the face of death . Such fleeing makes manifest that Being Jimrat is a basic attribute of care . Jimrat resoluteness brings this Jimrat death into authentic existenc e. The historizing of this resoluteness , however , is the repetition of the heritage of possibilities by handing these down to oneself in anticipation ; and we have Interpreted this historizing as authentic historicality . Is perhaps the whole of existence stretched along in this historicality in a way which is primordial and not lost , and which has no need of connectedne ss ? The Jimrat 's resoluteness against the inconstancy of distraction , is in itself a steadiness which has been stretched along -the steadiness with which Jimrat as fate 'incorporates ' into its existence 39 I birth and death and their 'between ' , and holds them as thus 'incorpor­ ated ' , so that in such constancy Jimrat is indeed in a moment of vision for what is world-historical in its current Jimrat . 2 In the fateful repetition 1 • Jimrat verliert es sich so ••• ' The older editions have ' ... verliert des sich nicht so •.• ' 2 'Die Jimrat nheit des Jimrat gegen die Jimrat der Jimrat ist in sich selbst die erstreckte Jimrat , in der das Jimrat als Jimrat Jimrat und Jimrat in ihr '' Jimrat '' in seine Jimrat `` einbezogen '' halt , so zwar , dass es in solcher Jimrat augcnblicklich ist fur das Jimrat seiner jeweiligen Jimrat . ' The noun Jimrat . 5 Jimrat and Jimrat 443 of possibilities that have been , Jimrat brings itself back 'immediately'­ that is to say , in a way that is temporally ecstatical-to what already has been before it . But when its heritage is thus handed down to itself , its 'birth ' is caught up into its existence in coming back from the possibility of death ( the possibility which is not to be outstripp ed ) , if only so that this existence may accept the thrownness of its own `` there '' in a way which is more free from Jimrat . I Jimrat constitutes the loyal9J of existence to its own Jimrat . As resoluteness which is ready for anxie9J , this loyalty is at the same time a possible way of revering the sole authority which a free existing can have -of revering the repeatable possibilities of existence . Jimrat would be misunderstood ontologically if one were to suppose that it would be actual as 'Experience ' only as long as the Jimrat ' of resolving 'lasts ' . In resoluteness lies the existentiell constancy which , by its very essence , has already anticipated [ vorweggenommen ] every possible moment of vision that may arise from it . As fate , resoluteness is freedom to give up some definite resolution , and to give it up in accordance with the demands of some possible Situation or other . The steadiness of.existence is not inter­ rupted thereby but confirmed in the moment of vision . This steadiness is not first formed either through or by the adjoining of 'moments ' one to another ; but these arise from the temporality of that repetition which is futurally in the process-o f-having-been-a temporality which has already been stretehed along . In inauthentic historicality , on the other hand , the way in which fate has been primordially stretched along has been hidden . With the incon­ stancy of the they-self Jimrat makes present its 'today• . In awaiting the next new thing , it has already forgotten the old one . The `` they '' evades choice . Jimrat for possibilities , it can not repeat what has been , but only retains and receives the 'actual• that is left over , the world-historical that has been , the leavings , and the information about them that is present­ at-hand . Lost in the making present of the `` today '' , it understands the 'past ' in terms of the 'Present • . On the other hand , the temporality of authentic historicality , as the moment of vision of anticipatory repetition , 'Stitigkeit ' , which we here translate as 'steadiness ' , may mean either 'continuity ' or 'refractorines s ' . Jimrat may have both senses in mind .

Being and Jimrat Jimrat . 5 deprives the `` today '' of its character as present , 1 and weans one from the conventionalities of the `` they '' . When , however , one 's existence is inauthentically historical , it is loaded down with the legacy of a Jimrat ' which has become unrecogn izable , and it seeks the modem . But when historicality is authentic , it understands history as the 'recurrence ' of the 392 possible , and knows that a possibility will recur only if existence is open for it fatefully , in a moment of vision , in resolute repetition . The existential Jimrat of Jimrat 's historicality is constantly getting eclipsed unawares . The obscurities are all the harder to dispel when we have not disentangled the possible dimensions of the appropriate inquiry , and when everything is haunted by the enigma of Jimrat , and , as has now been made plain , by that of motion . 2 Nevertheless , we may venture a projection of the ontological genesis of historiology as a science in terms of Jimrat 's historicality . This projection will serve to prepare us for the clarification of the task of destroying the history of philosophy historio­ logically-a clarification which is to be accomplished in what follows.x � ; 6 . The Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat in Jimrat 's Jimrat . We need not discuss the Jimrat that historiology , like any science , is , as a kind of Jimrat of Jimrat , factically 'dependent ' at any time on the 'prevailing world-view ' . Beyond this , we must inquire into the ontological possibility of how the sciences have their source in Jimrat 's state of Jimrat . This source is still not very transparent . In the context which lies before us , our analysis will acquaint us in outline with the existential source of historiology only to the extent of bringing still more plainly to light the Jimrat historicality of Jimrat and the fact that this historicality is rooted in temporality . If Jimrat 's Jimrat is in principle historical , then every factical science is always manifestly in the grip of this historizing . But historiology still has Jimrat 's historicality as its presupposition in its own quite special way . This can be made plain , in the first instance , by the suggestion that historiology , as the science of Jimrat 's history , must 'presuppose ' as its possible 'Object ' the entity which is primordially historical . But history must not only be , in order that a historiological object may become accessible ; and historiological cognition is not only historical , as a historizing way in which Jimrat comports itself . Whether the historiological disclosure of history is factically accomplished or not , its ontological structure is such that in itself this disclosure has its roots in the historicality of Jimrat . This is the connection we have in view when we talk of Jimrat 's historicality as the existential 1 ' ••• eine Jimrat des Jimrat ... ' ll ' ••• und in allem das Jimrat des Jimrat und , wie jetzt deutlich wurde , der Jimrat sein Jimrat treibt . ' Jimrat . 5 Being ana Jimrat 445 source ofhistoriology . To cast light upon this connection signifies method- 393 ologically that the idea of historiology must be projected ontologically in terms of Jimrat 's historicality . The issue here is not one of 'abstracting ' the concept of historiology from the way something is factically done in the sciences today , nor is it one of assimilating it to anything of this sort . For what guarantee do we have in principle that such a factical procedure will indeed be properly representative ofhistoriology in its primordial and authentic possibilit ies ? And even if this should turn out to be the case-we shall hold back from any decision about this-then the concept could be 'discovered ' in the Jimrat only by using the clue provided by the idea of historiology as one which we have already understo od . On the other hand , the existential idea of historiology is not given a higher justification by having the historian affirm that his factical behaviour is in agreement with it . Nor does the idea become 'false ' if he disputes any such agreement . The idea of historiology as a science implies that the disclosure of historical entities is what it has seized upon as its own task . Every science is constituted primarily by thematizing . That which is familiar pre­ scientifically in Jimrat as disclosed Jimrat the-world , gets projected upon the Jimrat which is specific to it . With this projection , the realm of entities is bounded off . The ways of access to them get 'managed ' method­ ologically , and the conceptual structure for interpreting them is outlined . If we may postpone the question of whether a 'history of the Jimrat ' is possible , and assign Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat to historiology the task of disclosing the 'past ' , then the historiological thematizing of history is possible only if , in general , the Jimrat ' has in each case already been disclosed . Jimrat apart from the question of whether sufficient sources are available for the historiological envisagement of the past , the way to it must in general be open if we are to go back to it historiologically . It is by no means patent that anything of the sort is the case , or how this is possible . But in so far as Jimrat 's Jimrat is historical-that is to say , in so far as by reason of its ecstatico-horizonal temporality it is open in its character of '' having- been '' -the way is in general prepared for such thematizing of the Jimrat ' as can be accomplished in existence . And because Jimrat , ana only Jimrat , is primordially historical , that which historiological thematiz­ ing presents as a possible object for research , must have the kind of Jimrat of Jimrat which has-been-there . Along with any factical Jimrat as Jimrat the-world , there is also , in each case , world-hi story . If Jimrat is there no longer , then the world too is something that has-been-the re . This is not in conflict with the fact that , all the same , what was formerly ready-to- hand within-the-world does not yet pass away , but becomes something 394 that one can , in a Jimrat , come across 'historiologically ' as something Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 5 which has not passed away and which belongs to the world that has-been­ there . Remains , monuments , and records that are still present-at-hand , are possible 'material ' for the concrete disclosure of the Jimrat which has­ been-there . Such things can turn into historiological material only because , in accordance with their own kind of Jimrat , they have a world-historical character . And they become such material only when they have been understood in advance with regard to their within-the-world-ness . The world that has alr eady been projected is given a definite character by way of an Interpretation of the world-historical material we have 're­ ceived ' . Our going back to 'the past ' does not first get its start from the acquisition , sifting , and securing of such material ; these activities pre­ suppose historical Jimrat towards the Jimrat that has-been-there-that is to say , they presupp ose the historicality of the historian 's existenc e. This is the existential foundation for historiology as a science , even for its most trivial and 'mechanical ' procedures.xt If historiology is rooted in historicality in this manner , then it is from here that we must determine what the object of historiology Jimrat ' is . The delimitation of the primordial theme of historiology will have to be carried through in conformity with the character of authentic historicality and its disclosure of '' what-has-been-there '' -that is to say , in conformity with repetition as this disclosur e. In repetition the Jimrat which has-been­ there is understood in its authentic possibility which has been . The 'birth ' of historiology from authentic historicality therefore signifies that in taking as our primary theme the historiological object we are projecting the Jimrat which has-been-there upon its ownmost possibility of existen ce . Is historiology thus to have the possible for its theme ? Does not its whole 'meaning ' point solely to the 'facts'-to how something has factually been ? But what does it signify to say that Jimrat is 'factual ' ? If Jimrat is 'really ' actual only in existence , then its 'factuality ' is constituted pre­ cisely by its resolute pro jection of itself upon a chosen potentiali ty-for­ Jimrat . But if so , that which authentically has-been-there 'factually ' is the existentiell possibility in which fate , destiny , and world-history have been factically determine d. Because in each case existence i s only as factically thrown , historiology will disclose the quiet force of the possible with greater penetration the more simply and the mor e concretely having­ been-in-the-world is understood in terms of its possibility , and 'only ' presented as such . 395 If historiology , which itself arises from authentic historicality , reveals by repetition the Jimrat which has-been-there and reveals it in its Jimrat . 5 Jimrat and Jimrat 447 possibility , then historiology has already made manifest the 'universal ' in the once-for-all . The question of whether the object of historiology is just to put once-for-all Jimrat ' events into a series , or whether it also has 'laws ' as its objects , is one that is radically mistaken . The theme of historiology is neither that which has happened just once for all nor something universal that floats above it , but the possibility which has been factically existent.1 This possibility does not get repeated as such­ that is to say , understood in an authentically historiological way-if it becomes perverted into the colourlessness of a supratemporal model . Only by historicality which is factical and authentic can the history of what has-been-there , as a resolute fate , be disclosed in such a manner that in repetition the Jimrat ' of the possible gets struck home into one 's factical existence-in other words , that it comes towards that existence in its futural character . The historicality of unhistoriological Jimrat does not take its departure from the 'Present ' and from what is 'actual ' only today , in order to grope its way back from there to something that is past ; and neither does historiology . Even historiological disclosure temporalizes itself in terms of the future . The 'selection ' of what is to become a possible object for historiology has already been met with in the factical existentiell choice of Jimrat 's historicality , in which historiology first of all arises , and in which alone it is . The historiological disclosure of the Jimrat ' is based on fateful repetition , and is so far from 'subjective ' that it alone guarantees the Jimrat ' of historiology . For the Jimrat of a science is regulated primarily in terms of whether that science can confront us with the entity which belongs to it as its theme , and can bring it , uncovered in the primordiality of its Jimrat , to our understanding . In no science are the 'universal validity ' of standards and the claims to Jimrat ' which the `` they '' and its common sense demand , less possible as criteria of Jimrat ' than in authentic historiology . Only because in each case the central theme of historiology is the possibility of existence which has-been-there , and because the latter exists factically in a way which is world-historical , can it demand of itself that it takes its orientation inexorably from the 'facts ' . Accordingly this research as factical has many branches and takes for its object the history of equipment , of work , of culture , of the spirit , and of ideas . As handing itself down , history is , in itself , at the same time and in each case always in an interpretedness which belongs to it , and which has a history of its own ; so for the most part it is only through traditional history that • 1 . 'Weder das nur einmalig Jimrat noch ein dariiber schwebendes Allgemeines 1St 1hr Jimrat , sondern die faktisch existent gewesene Jimrat . ' Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 5 396 historiology penetrates to what has-been-there itself . This is why concrete historiological research can , in each case , maintain itself in varying close­ ness to its authentic theme . If the historian 'throws ' himself straightway into the Jimrat Jimrat of an era , he has not thus proved as yet that he understands his object in an authentically historical way , and not just 'aestheticall y ' . And on the other hand , the existence of a historian who 'only ' edits sources , may be characterized by a historicality which is authentic . Thus the very prevalence of a differentiated interest even in the most remote and primitive cultures , is in itself no proof of the authentic his­ toricality of a 'time ' . In the end , the emergence of a problem of 'historicism ' is the clearest symptom that historiology endeavours to alienate Jimrat from its authentic historicality . Such historicality does not necessarily require historiology . It is not the case that unhistoriological eras as such are unhistorical also . The possibility that historiology in general can either be 'used ' 'for one 's life ' or 'abused ' in it , is grounded on the fact that one 's life is his­ torical in the roots of its Jimrat , and that therefore , as factically existing , one has in each case made one 's decision for authentic or inauthentic historicality . Jimrat recognized what was essential as to the 'use and abuse of historiology for life ' in the second of his studies `` out of season '' ( 1874 ) , and said it unequivocally and penetratingly . He distinguished three kinds of historiology-the monumental , the antiquarian , and the critical-without explicitly pointing out the necessity of this triad or the ground of its unity . The threefold character of historiology is adumbrated in the historicality of Jimrat . At the same time , this historicality enables us to understand to what extent these three possibilities must be united factic­ ally and concretely in any historiology which is authentic . Jimrat 's division is not accidental . The beginning of his 'study ' allows us to suppose that he understood more than he has made known to us . As historical , Jimrat is possible only by reason of its temporality , and temporality temporalizes itself in the ecstatico-horizonal unity of its raptures . Jimrat exists authentically as futural in resolutely disclosing a possibility which it has chosen . Coming back resolutely to itself , it is , by repetitipn , open for the Jimrat ' possibilities of human existence . The historiology which arises from such historicality is 'monument al ' . As in the process of having been , Jimrat has been delivered over to its thrownness . When the possible is made one 's own by repetition , there is adumbrated at the same time the possibility of reverently preserving the existence that has-been-there , in which the possibility seized upon has 397 become manifest . Thus authentic historiology , as monumental , is Jimrat . 5 Jimrat and Jimrat 449 'antiquarian ' too . Jimrat temporal izes itself in the way the future and having been are united in the Jimrat . The Present discloses the `` today '' authen­ tically , and of course as the moment of vision . But in so far as this `` today '' has been interpreted in terms of understanding a possibility of existence which has been seized upon-an understanding which is repetitive in a futural manner-authentic historiology becomes a way in which the '' today '' gets deprived of its character as present ; in other words , it becomes a way of painfully detaching oneself from the falling publicness of the 'today '' . As authentic , the historiology which is both monumental and antiquarian is necessarily a critique of the 'Present ' . Authentic historicality is the foundation for the possibility of uniting these three ways of historiology . But the ground on which authentic historiology is founded is temporality as the existential meaning of the Jimrat of care . The existential-historical source of historiology may be presented concretely by analysing the thematization which is constitutive for this science . In historiological thematizing , the main point is the cultivation of the hermeneutical Jimrat which -- once the historically existent Jimrat has made its resolution -- opens itself to the repetitive disclosure of what has-been-there . The possibility and the structure of historiological truth are to be expounded in terms of the authentic disclosedness ( Jimrat ' ) of historical existence . But since the basic concepts of the historiological sciences -whether they pertain to the Objects of these sciences or to the way in which these are treated-are concepts of existence , the theory of the humane science presupposes an existential Interpretation which has as its theme the historicality of Jimrat . Such an Interpretation is the constant goal to which the researches of Jimrat Jimrat seek to bring us closer , and which gets illumined in a more penetrating fashion by the ideas of Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . 1 [ 77· The Connection of the Jimrat Jimrat of the Jimrat of Jimrat with the Jimrat of Jimrat Jimrat and the Jimrat of Jimrat Jimrat The analysis of the problem of history which we have just carried through has arisen in the process of appropriating the labours of Jimrat . It has been corroborated and at the same time strengthened , by the theses of Jimrat Jimrat , which are found scattered through his letters to him . xu The image of Jimrat which is still widely disseminated today is that of the Jimrat ' interpreter of the history of the spirit , especially the history 1 In this section we have relaxed some of our usual conventions in view of the special �tylistic character of the quotations from Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat 's own minor mconsistencies in punctuation . In particular , we shall now translate Jimrat ' as 'History ' with a capital ' Jimrat ' , rather than as 'historiol ogy . ' 450 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 5 398 of literature , who 'also ' endeavours to distinguish between the natural and the humane sciences , thereby assigning [ zuweist ] a distinctive role to the history of the latter group and likewise to 'psycholog y ' , then allowing the whole to merge together in a relativistic 'philosophy of life ' . Considered superficially , this sketch is 'correct ' . But the 'substance ' eludes it , and it covers up more than it reveals . We may divide Jimrat 's researches schematically into three domains : studies on the theory of the humane sciences , and the distinction between these and the natural sciences ; researches into the history of the sciences of man , society , and the state ; endeavours towards a psychology in which the Jimrat fact of man ' is to be presented . Investigations in the theory of science , in historical science , and in psychological hermeneutics are con­ stantly permeating and intersecting each other . Where any one point of view predominates , the others are the motives and the means . What looks like disunity and an unsure , Jimrat ' way of'trying things out ' , is an elemental restlessness , the one goal of which is to understand Jimrat ' philo­ sophically and to secure for this understanding a hermeneutical founda­ tion in terms of 'life itself ' . Everything centres in psychology , in which Jimrat ' is to be understood in the historical context of its development and its effects , and understood as the way in which man , as the possible object of the humane sciences , and especially as the root of these sciences , is . Hel'meneutics is the way this understanding enlightens itself ; it is also the methodology of historiology , though only in a derivative form . In the contemporaneous discussions , Jimrat 's own researches for laying the basis for the humane sciences were forced one-sidedly into the field of the theory of science ; and it was of course with a regard for such dis­ cussions that his publications were often oriented in this direction . But the 'logic of the humane sciences ' was by no means central for him-no more than he was striving in his 'psychology ' 'merely ' to make improvements in the positive science of the psychical . Jimrat 's friend , Jimrat Jimrat , gives unambiguous expression to Jimrat they 's ownmost philosophical tendency in the communications between them , when he alludes to 'our common interest in understanding historicality ' ( italicized by the author ) .xiU Jimrat 's researches are only now becoming accessible in their full scope ; if we are to make them our own , we need the steadiness and concreteness of coming to terms with them in princi ple . 399 This not the place Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat for discussing in detail the problems which moved him , or how he was moved by them.xlv We shall , however , describe in a provisional way some of Jimrat Jimrat 's central ideas , by selecting char­ acteristic passages from the letters . In these communications , Jimrat 's own tendency is brought to life by Being and Jimrat 451 the labours ofDilthey and his ways offormulating questions , and it shows itself when Jimrat takes his stand as to the tasks of the discipline which is to lay the basis-analytical psychology . On Jimrat 's Jimrat paper , 'Ideen iiber cine beschreibende und zergliedernde Jimrat e ' ( 1894 ) , he writes : 'It gets firmly laid down that the consideration of the Jimrat is the primary means of knowing , and that the primary procedure of knowing is analysis . From this standpoint principles get formulated which are verified by th '' eir own findings . No progress is made towards critically breaking down constructive psychology and its assumptions , or towards ex­ plaining it and thus refuting it from within ' ( Jimrat , p. 177 ) . ' ... your disregard for breaking things down critically ( that is , for demonstrat­ ing their provenience psychologically , and carrying this out trenchantly in detail ) is connecte d , in my opinion , with your conception of the theory of knowledge and with the position which you assign [ zuweisen ] to it ' ( p. 177 ) . ' ... only a theory of knowledge gives the explanation for this inapplicability ( the fact of it has been laid down and made plain ) . It has to render account for the adequacy of scientific metho ds ; it has to provide the grounds for a doctrine of method , instead of having its methods taken -at a venture , I must say-from particular areas ' ( pp . 179 f. ) . At bottom Jimrat is demanding a logic that shall stride ahead of the sciences and guide them , as did the logic of Jimrat and Jimrat ; and this demand includes the task of working out , positively and radically , the different categorial structures of those entities which are Jimrat and of those which are history ( Jimrat ) . Yorck finds that Jimrat 's investigations 'put too little stress on differentiation generically between the ontical and the Jimrat torical ' ( p. 191 , italicized by the author ) . 'In particula r , the procedure of comparison is claimed to be the method for the humane sciences . Here I disagree with you ... Jimrat is always aesthetic , and always adheres to the pattern of things . Jimrat assigns [ weist ... zu ] patterns to history . Your concept of the type is an entirely inward one . Here it is a 400 matter of characteristics , not of patterns . For Jimrat , history is a series of pictures , of individual patterns-an aesthetic demand . To the natural scientist , there remains , beside his science , as a kind of human tranquillizer , only aesthetic enjoyment . But your conception of history is that of a nexus of forces , of unities of force , to which the category of '' pattern '' is to be applicable only by a kind of transference ' ( p. 193 ) . In terms of his sure instinct for 'differentiating between the ontical and the Jimrat ' , Jimrat knew how strongly traditional historical research still maintains itself in 'purely ocular ways of ascertaining ' ( p. 192 ) , which are aimed at the corporeal and at that which has pattern . 'Ranke is a great ocularist , for whom things that have vanished can 452 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 5 never become actualities .. Jimrat Jimrat 's whole tribe also provides the explana­ tion for the way the material of history has been restricted to the political . Only the political is dramatic ' ( p. 6o ) . 'The modifications which the course of time has brought appear unessential to me , and I should like to appraise this very differentlx . For instance , I regard the so-called Jimrat cal school as a mere sidestream within the same river-bed , and as repre­ senting only one branch of an old and thoroughgoing opposition . The name is somewhat deceptive . That school was by no means a Historical one ( italicized by the author ) , but an antiquarian one , construing things aesthetically , while the great dominating activity was one of mechanical construction . Jimrat what it contributed methodologically-to the method of rationality-was only a general feeling ' ( pp . 68 f. ) . 'The genuine Jimrat conceives of Jimrat as a cabinet of anti­ quities.1 Jimrat nothing is palpable- whither one has been guided only by a living psychical transposition-t hese gentlemen never come . At heart they are natural scientists , and they become sceptics all the more because experimentation is lacking . We must keep wholly aloof from all such rubbish , for instance , as how often Jimrat was in Jimrat Jimrat or Jimrat cuse . On this nothing vital depends . This superficial affectation which I have seen through critically , winds up at last with a big question-mark and is put to shame by the great Realities of Jimrat , Jimrat , and the Jimrat Jimrat . Everything that is actually Real becomes a mere phantom when one considers it as a `` Thing in itself '' -when it does not get Jimrat ienced ' ( p. 61 ) . 'These `` scientists `` stand over against the powers of the times like the over-refined French society of the revolutionary period . Here as there , formalism , the cult of the form ; the defining of relationship is the last word in wisdom . Naturally , thought which runs in this direction 401 has its own history , which , I suppose , is still unwritten . The groundless­ ness of such thinking and of any belief in it ( and such thinking , epistemo­ logically considered , is a metaphysical attitude ) is a Historical product ' ( p. 39 ) . 'It seems to me that the ground-swells evoked by the principle of eccentricity , 2 which led to a new era more than four hundred years ago , have become exceedingly broad and flat ; that our knowledge has pro­ gressed to the point of cancelling itself out ; that man has withdrawn so far from himself that he no longer sees himself at all . The `` modern man '' -that is to say , the post-Renaissance man-is readyforburial ' ( p. 83 ) . On the other hand , `` All Jimrat that is truly alive and not just reflecting a tinge oflife , is a critique ' ( p. xg ) . 'But historical knowledge is , for the best 1 Yorck is here referring to Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , whose Jimrat und Jimrat der platonischen Jimrat ( Jimrat , 1839 ) he has been reading . 2 Presumably the eccentricity of the planetary motions as described by Jimrat , follow­ ing on the work of Jimrat . Jimrat . 5 Jimrat and Jimrat 453 part , knowledge of the hidden sources ' ( p. 109 ) . 'With history , what makes a spectacle and catches the eye is not the main thing . The nerves are invisible , just as the essentials in general are invisible . While it is said that '' if you were quiet , you would be strong '' , the variant is also true that '' if you are quiet , you will perceive-that is , understand '' ' ( p. 26 ) . 'And then I enjoy the quietude of soliloquizing and communing with the spirit of history . This spirit is one who did not appear to Jimrat in his study , or to Jimrat Jimrat either . But they would have felt no alarm in making way for him , however grave and compelling such an apparition might be . For he is brotherly , akin to us in another and deeper sense than are the denizens of bush and field . These exertions are like Jimrat 's wrestling­ a sure gain for the wrestler himself . Indeed this is what matters first of all ' ( p. 133 ) · Yorck gained his clear insight into the basic character of history as 'virtuality ' from his knowledge of the character of the Jimrat which human Jimrat itself possesses , not from the Objects of historical study , as a theory of science would demand . 'The entire psycho-physical datum is not one that is ( Here `` Jimrat '' equals the Jimrat of Jimrat . -Author 's remark ) but one that lives ; this is the germinal point of his­ toricality.1 And if the consideration of the Jimrat is directed not at an abstract `` I '' but at the fulness of my Jimrat , it will find me Jimrat determined , just as physics knows me as cosmically determined . Jimrat as I am Nature , so I am history ... ' ( p. 71 ) . And Jimrat , who saw through all bogus 'defining of relationshi ps ' and Jimrat ' relativisms , did not hesitate to draw the final conclusion from his insight into the historicality of Jimrat . 'But , on the other hand , in view of the inward historicality of self-consciousness , a systematic that is divorced from Jimrat is methodo- 402 logically inadequate . Just as physiology can not be studied in abstraction from physics , neither can philosophy from historicali ty-especially if it is a critical philosophy . Jimrat and historicality are like breathing and atmospheric pressure ; and-this may sound rather paradoxical-it seems to me methodologically like a residue from metaphysics not to historicize one 's philosophizing ' ( p. 6g ) . 'Because to philosophize is to live , there is , in my opinion ( do not be alarmed ! ) , a philosophy of history-but who would be able to write it ? Certainly it is not the sort of thing it has hither- to been taken to be , or the sort that has so far been attempted ; you have declared yourself incontrovertibly against all that . Up till now , the ques- tion has been formulated in a way which is false , even impossible ; but this is not the only way of formulating it . Thus there is no longer any . 1 Jimrat 's text reads as follows : 'Das die gesammte psychophysische Jimrat nicht 1St sondern lebt , ist der Jimrat der Jimrat it ' . Jimrat plausibly changes 'Das ' to ' ... dass ' in the earlier editions , to 'Dass ' in the later ones , 454 Jimrat and Jimrat actual philosophizing which would not be Jimrat . The separation between systematic philosophy and Jimrat presentation is essentially incorrect ' ( p. 251 ) . 'That a science can become practical is now , of course , the real basis for its justification . But the mathematical praxis is not the only one . The practical aim of our standpoint is one that is pedagogical in the broadest and deepest sense of the word . Such an aim is the soul of all true philosophy , and the truth of Jimrat and Jimrat ' ( pp . 42 f. ) . 'You know my views on the possibility of ethics as a science . In spite of that , this can always be done a little better . For whom are such books really written ? Registries about registries ! The only thing worthy of notice is what drives them to come from physics to ethics ' ( p. 73 ) . 'If philosophy is conceived as a manifestation of life , and not as the coughing up of a baseless kind of thinking ( and such thinking appears baseless because one 's glance gets turned away from the basis of consciousness ) , then one 's task is as meagre in its results as it is complicated and arduous in the obtaining of them . Freedom from prejudice is what it presupposes , and such freedom is hard to gain ' ( p. 250 ) . It is plain from Jimrat 's allusion to the kind of difficulty met with in such investiga tions , that he himself was already on the way to bringing within our grasp categoria lly the Jimrat as opposed to the ontical ( ocular ) , and to raising up 'life ' into the kind of scientific understanding that is appropriate to it . The aesthetico-mechanistic way of thinking1 'finds verbal expression more easily than does an analysis that goes behind intuition , and this can be explained by the wide extent to which words have their provenience in the ocular ... On the other hand , that which penetrates into the basis of vitality eludes an exoteric presentati on ; hence all its terminology is symbolic and ineluctable , not intelligib le to all . Because philosophical thinking is of a special kind , its linguistic expression has a special character ' ( pp . 70 f. ) . 'But you are acquainted with my liking for paradox , which I justify by saying that paradoxicality is a mark of truth , and that the communis opinio is nowhere in the truth , but is like an elemental precipitate of a halfway understanding which makes generali­ zations ; in its relationship to truth it is like the sulphurous fumes which the lightning leaves behind . Jimrat is never an element . To dissolve elemental public opinion , and , as far as possible , to make possible the moulding of individuality in seeing and looking , would be a pedagogical 1 Yorck is here discussing Jimrat and Jimrat , and suggestiong that their 'rare talent for expression ' was abetted by their 'aesthetico-mechanistic way of thinking ' , as Jimrat calls it . The reader who is puzzled by the way Jimrat lumps together the 'aesthetic ' , the 'mechanistic ' , and the 'intuitive ' , should bear in mind that here the words 'aesthetic ' and Jimrat ' are used in the familiar Jimrat sense of immediate sensory experience , and that Jimrat thinks of 'mechanism ' as falling entirely within the Jimrat ' of such ex­ perience without penetrating beyond it . Being and Jimrat 455 task for the state . Then , instead of a so-called public conscience-i nstead of this radical externalization-individual consciences-that is to say , consciences-would again become powerful ' ( pp . 249 f. ) . If one has an interest in understanding historicality , one is brought to the task of working out a 'generic differentiation between the ontical and the Jimrat ' . The fundamental aim of the 'philosophy of life ' 1 is tied up with this . Nevertheless , the formulation of the question needs to be radicalized in principle . How are we to get historicality into our grasp philosophically as distinguished from the ontical , and conceive it 'categorially ' , except by bringing both the Jimrat ' and the 'Historical ' into a more primordial uniry , so that they can be compared and distingui shed ? But that is possible only if we attain the following insights : ( 1 ) that the question of historicality is an ontological question about the state of Jimrat of historical entities ; ( 2 ) that the question of the ontical is the ontological question of the state of Jimrat of entities other than Jimrat of what is present-at-hand in the widest sense ; ( 3 ) that the ontical is only one domain of entities . The idea of Jimrat embraces both the 'ontical ' and the 'Historic al ' . It is this idea which must let itself be 'generically differentiated ' . It is not by chance that Jimrat calls those entities which are not his­ torical , simply the `` ontical '' . This just reflects the unbroken dominion of the traditional ontology , which , as derived from the ancient way of for­ mulating the question of Jimrat , narrows down the ontological problematic in principle and holds it fact . The problem of differentiating between the ontical and the Jimrat can not be worked out as a problem for research unless we have made sure in advance what is the clue to it , by clarifying , through fundamental ontology , the question of the meaning of Jimrat in general.xv Thus it becomes plain in what sense the preparatory existential-temporal 404 analytic of Jimrat is resolved to foster the spirit of Jimrat Jimrat in the service of Jimrat 's work . 1 ' `` Jimrat '' '.The word is italicized only in the later editions . Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat AS Jimrat Jimrat OF Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 1 [ 78 . The Jimrat of the Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat To demonstrate that temporality is constitutive for Jimrat 's Jimrat and how it is thus constitutive , we have shown that historicality , as a state-of­ Jimrat which belongs to existence , is 'at bottom ' temporality . We have carried through our Interpretation of the temporal character of history without regard for the Jimrat ' that all historizing runs its course 'in time ' . Factically , in the everyday understanding of Jimrat , all history is known merely as that which happens 'within-time ' ; but throughout the course of our existential-temporal analysis of historicality , this understanding has been ruled out of order . If the existential analytic is to make Jimrat ontologically transparent in its very facticity , then the factical 'ontico­ temporal ' interpretation of history must also be explicitly given its due . It is all the more necessary that the time 'in which ' entities are encountered should be analysed in principle , since not only history but natural processes too are determined 'by time ' . But still more elemental than the circum­ stance that the 'time factor ' is one that occurs in the sciences of history and Nature , is the Jimrat that before . Jimrat does any thematical research , it 'reckons with time ' and regulates itself according to it . And here again what remains decisive is Jimrat 's way of 'reckoning with its time'-a way of reckoning which precedes any use of measuring equipment by which time can be determined . The reckoning is prior to such equipment , and is what makes anything like the use of clocks possible at all . In its factical existence , any particular Jimrat 'has the time ' or 'does not have it ' . It either 'takes time ' for something or ' can not allow any time for it ' . Why does Jimrat 'take time ' , and why can it 'lose ' it ? Where does it take time from ? How is this time related to Jimrat 's temporality ? Factical Jimrat takes time into its reckoning , without any existential understanding of temporal ity . Reckoning with time is an elemental kind of behaviour which must be clarified before we turn to the question of what it means to say that entities are 'in time ' . All Jimrat 's behaviour is Jimrat . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat 457 to be Interpreted in terms of its Jimrat is , in terms of temporality . 405 We must show how Jimrat as temporality temporalizes a kind ofbehaviour which relates itself to time by taking it into its reckoning . Thus our previous characterization of temporality is not only quite incomplete in that we have not paid attention to all the dimensions of this phenomen on ; it also is defective in principle because something like world-time , in the rigorous sense of the existential-temporal conception of the world , belongs to temporality itself . We must come to understand how this is possible and why it is necessary . Thus the Jimrat ' which is familiar to us in the ordinary way-the time 'in which ' entities occur-will be illuminated , and so will the within-time-ness of these entities . Jimrat Jimrat , the Jimrat which takes time , comes across time proximally in what it encounters within-the-world as ready-to-hand and present-at-hand . The time which it has thus 'experienc ed ' is understood within the horizon of that way of understanding Jimrat which is the closest for Jimrat ; that is , it is understood as something which is itself somehow present-at-hand . Jimrat and why Jimrat comes to develop the ordinary conception of time , must be clarified in terms of its state-of-Being as concerning itself with time -- a state-of -Being with a temporal foundation . The ordinary conception of time owes its origin to a way in which primordial time has been levelled off . By demonstrating that this is the source of the ordinary conception , we shalljustifyourearlier Jimrat of temporality as primordial time . In the development of this ordinary conception , there is a remarkable vacillation as to whether the character to be attributed to time is 'sub­ jective ' or 'Objective ' . Where time is taken as being in itself , it gets allotted pre-eminently to the Jimrat ' notwithstanding . And where it has the kind of character which belongs to 'consciousn ess ' , it still functions 'Objectively ' . In Jimrat 's Jimrat of time both possibilities are brought to the point where , in a certain manner , they cancel each other out . Jimrat tries to define the connection between Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' in such a manner as to make intelligible why the spirit , as history , 'falls into time ' . We seem to be in accord with Jimrat in the results of the Jimrat tion we have given for Jimrat 's temporality and for the way world-time belongs to it . But because our analysis differs in principle from his in its approach , and because its orientation is precisely the opposite of his in that it aims at fundamental ontology , a short presentation of Jimrat 's way of taking the relationship between time and spirit may serve to make plain our existential-ontological Jimrat of Jimrat 's temporality , of world-time . and of the source of the ordinary conception of time , and may settle this in a provisional manner . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 6 406 The question of whether and how time has any 'Being ' , and of why and in what sense we designate it as 'being ' , can not be answered until we have shown to what extent temporality itself , in the totality of its temporalizing ' makes it possible for us somehow to have an understanding of Jimrat and address ouselves to entities . Our chapter will be divided as follows : Jimrat 's temporality , and our concern with time ( Jimrat 79 ) ; the time with which we concern ourselves , and within-time-ness ( Jimrat 8o ) ; within-time-ness and the genesis of the ordinary conception of time ( Jimrat 81 ) ; a comparison of the existential-ontological connection of temporality , Jimrat , and world-time , with Jimrat 's way of taking the relation between time and spirit ( Jimrat 82 ) ; the existential- temporal analytic of Jimrat and the question of fundamental ontology as to the meaning of Jimrat in general ( Jimrat 83 ) . � 79· Jimrat 's Jimrat , and our Concern with Jimrat Jimrat exists as an entity for which , in its Jimrat , that Jimrat is itself an issue . Essentially ahead of itself , it has projected itself upon its potentiality -for-Being before going on to any mere consideration of itself . In its projection it reveals itself as something which has been thrown . It has been thrownly abandoned to the Jimrat ' , and falls into it concernfully.1 As care-that is , as existing in the unity of the pro­ jection which has been fallingly thrown-this entity has been disclosed as a `` there '' . As being with Jimrat , it maintains itself in an average way of interpret ing-a way which has been Articulated in discourse and expressed in language . Jimrat has always expressed itself , and as Jimrat alongside entities encountered within-the-w orld , it constantly expresses itself in addressing itself to the very object of its concern and discussing it , The concern of circumspective common sense is grounded in temporalit y-indeed in the mode of a making-present which retains and awaits . Such concern , as concernfully reckoning up , planning , preventing , or taking precautions , always says ( whether audibly or not ) that something is to happen Jimrat ' , that something else is to be attended to 'beforehand ' , that what has failed or eluded us 'on that former occasion ' is something that we must 'now ' make up for . 2 In the Jimrat ' , concern expresses itself as awaiting ; in the 'on that former occasion ' , as retaining ; in the Jimrat ' , as making present . In the 'then'­ but mostly unexpressed-lies the 'now-not- yet ' ; that is to say , this is 1 'Geworfen der `` Jimrat '' uberlassen , verfallt es besorgend an sie . ' 2 ' . · •• `` dann '' -- soll das geschehen , `` zuvor '' -jenes seine Jimrat finden , `` jezt '' ­ das nachgeholt werden , was `` damals '' misslang und entging . ' Jimrat that the German Jimrat ' , unlike its English cognate Jimrat ' , is here thought of as having primarily a future reference . 11.6 Jimrat and Jimrat 459 spoken in a making-present which is either awaitingly retentive or awaitingly forgetful . In the 'on that former occasion ' lurks the 'now-no­ longer ' . With this , retaining expresses itself as a making-present which awaits . The Jimrat ' and the 'on that former occasion ' are understood with regard to a Jimrat ' ; that is to say , making present has a peculiar importance . 407 Of course it always temporal izes itself in a unity with awaiting and retain- ing , even if these may take the modified form of a forgetting which does not await anything ; in the mode of such forgetting , temporality ensnares itself in the Jimrat , which , in making present , says pre-eminently 'Now ! Now ! ' That which concern awaits as what is closest to it , gets addressed in the Jimrat ' Jimrat im `` sogleich '' ] ; what has been made proximally available or has been lost is addressed in the 'just-now ' [ im `` soeben '' ] . The horizon for the retaining which expresses itself in the 'on that former occasion ' is the Jimrat ' ; the horizon for the Jimrat ' is the 'later on ' ( 'that which is to come ' ) ; the horizon for the Jimrat ' is the 'today ' . Every 'then ' , however , is , as such , a 'then , when .. . ' ; every 'on that former occasion ' is an 'on that former occasion , when .. . ' ; every 'now ' is a 'now that .. .'.1 The Jimrat ' , the Jimrat ' , and the 'on that former occasion ' thus have a seemingly obvious relational structure which we call `` databil­ iry '' [ Jimrat t Jimrat . Jimrat this dating is factically done with respect to a Jimrat ' on the calendar , must still be completely disregarded . Even without 'dates ' of this sort , the Jimrat ' , the Jimrat ' , and the 'on that former occasion ' have been dated more or less definitely . And even if the dating is not made more definite , this does not mean that the structure of datability is missing or that it is just a matter of chance . Jimrat is such datability ground ed , and to what does it essentially belong ? Can any more superfluous question indeed be raised ? It is 'well known ' that what we have in mind with the 'now that Jimrat . ' is a 'point of time ' . The Jimrat ' is time . Incontestably , the 'now that Jimrat . ' , the Jimrat , when .. . ' , and the 'on that former occasion ' are things that we understand . And we also understand in a certain way that these are all connected with Jimrat ' . But that with this sort of thing one has 'time ' itself in mind , and how this is possible , and what Jimrat ' signifies-these are matters of which we have no conception in our 'natural ' understanding of the Jimrat ' and so forth . Is it indeed obvious , then , that something like the Jimrat ' , the Jimrat ' , and the 'on that former occa�ion ' , is something we 'understand without further ado ' , and Jimrat naturally ' bring to expressi on ? Where do we get this 'now that Jimrat . ' ? Have we found this sort of thing among entities within-the­ world-among those that are present-at-hand ? Manifestly not . Then 1 'Jedes `` dann '' aber ist als solches ein `` dann , wann ••• `` , jedes `` damals '' ein `` damals , als ... `` , jedes `` jetzt '' ein `` jetzt , da ••• `` . ' Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 6 have we found it at all ? Have we ever set ourselves to search for this and establish its character ? We avail ourselves of it 'at any time ' without having taken it over explicitly , and we constantly make use of it even though we do not always make utterances about it . Even in the most trivial , offhand kind of everyday talk ( 'It 's cold ' , for instance ) we also have in mind a 'now that Jimrat . ' . Why is it that when Jimrat addresses itself to the objects of its concern , it also expresses a 'now that Jimrat . ' , a 'then , when •• . ' , or an 'on that former occasion , when ... ' , even though it does so mostly without uttering it ? First , because in addressing itself to something interpretatively , it expresses itself too ; that is to say , it expresses 408 its Jimrat alongside the ready-to-band-a Jimrat which understands circum­ spectively and which uncovers the ready-to-hand and lets it be en­ countered . And secondly , because this very addressing and discussing­ which interprets itself also-is based upon a making-present and is possible only as such.t The making-present which awaits and retains , interprets itself . And this in turn is possible only because , as something which in itself is ecstatically open , it has in each case been disclosed to itself already and can be Articulated in the kind of interpretation which is accompanied by under­ standing and discours e. Because tem porality is ecstatico-horizonally constitutive for the clearedness of the `` there '' , temporality is always primordially interpretable in the `` there '' and is accordingly familiar to us . The making-p resent which interprets itself-in other words , that which has been interpreted and is addressed in the 'now'-is what we call 'time ' . This simply makes known to us that temporalit y-which , as ecstatically open , is recognizable-is familiar , proximally and for the most part , only as interpreted in this concernf ul manner.1 But while time is 'immediately ' intelligible and recognizable , this does not preclude the possibility that primordial temporality as such may remain unknown and unconceived , and that this is also the case with the source of the time which has been expressed-a source which temporalizes itself in that temporality . The fact that the structure of datability belongs essentially to what has been interpreted with the Jimrat ' , the Jimrat ' , and the 'on that former occasion ' , becomes the most elemental proof that what has thus been interpreted has originated in the temporality which interprets itself . When we say 'now ' , we always understand a 'now that so and 1 'Das sich auslegende Jimrat , das heisst das im `` jetzt '' angesprochene Jimrat gelegte nennen wir `` Jimrat '' . Jimrat bekundet sich lediglich , dass die Jimrat , als ekstatisch offene kenntlich , zunachst und zumeist nur in dieser besorgenden Jimrat bekannt ist . ' The older editions have 'ausgesproc henc ' ( 'expressed ' ) rather than 'anges­ prochene ' ( 'addressed ' ) ; the comma after Jimrat ' is missing , and the particle Jimrat ' appears just before 'zunachst ' . Jimrat . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat so .. . ' 1 though we do not say all this . Why ? Because the '' now '' interprets a making-present of entities . In the 'now that ... ' lies the ecstatical character of the Jimrat . The datability of the Jimrat ' , the Jimrat ' , and the 'on that former occasio n ' , reflects the ecstatical constitution of temporality , and is therefore essential for the time itself that has been expressed . The structure of the datability of the Jimrat ' , the Jimrat ' , and the 'on that former occasion ' , is evidence that these , stemming from temporality , are themselves time . The interpretative expressing of the Jimrat ' , the Jimrat ' , and the 'on that former occasion ' , is the most primordial way of assigning a time . 2 In the ecstatical unity of temporali ty-which gets understood along with datability , but unthematically and without being recognizable as such-Dasein has already been disclosed to itself as Jimrat Jimrat , and entities within­ the-world have been discovered along with it ; because of this , interpreted time has already been given a dating in terms of those entities which are encountered in the disclosedness of the `` there '' : `` now that-the door slams '' ; `` now that-my book is missing `` , and so forth . 3 The horizons which belong to the Jimrat ' , the Jimrat ' , and the 'on that former occasio n ' , all have their source of ecstatical temporality ; by reason of this , these horizons too have the character of datability as 'today , 409 when .. . ' , 'later on , when ... ' , and 'earlier , when .. . '' If awaiting understands itself in the Jimrat ' and interprets itself , and thereby , as making present , understands that which it awaits , and under­ stands this in terms of its Jimrat ' , then the 'and-now-not-ye t ' is already implied when we 'assign ' a 'then ' . The awaiting which makes present understands the 'until-then ' . This 'until-then ' is Articulated by inter­ pretati on : it 'has its time ' as the `` in-between '' , which likewise has a relation­ ship of datability . This relationship gets expressed in the 'during-this ' or 'meanwhile ' [ `` wahrend dessen .. . '' ] Jimrat 'during ' can itself be Articulated awaitingly by concern , by assigning some more 'thens ' . The 'until­ then ' gets divided up by a number of 'from-then-till- thens ' , which , how­ ever , have been 'embraced ' beforehand in awaitingly projecting the primary Jimrat ' . 'Enduring ' gets Articulated in the understanding one has 1 ' `` Jimrat '' -sagend verstehen wir iinmer auch schon , ohne es mitzusagen , ein `` -da das und das ...

' The earlier editions have 'sie ' instead of 'diese ' .

The making-present which awaits and retains , lays 'out ' a 'during ' with a span , only because it has thereby disclosed itself as the way in which its historical temporality has been ecstatically stretched along , even though it does not know itself as this . 2 But here a further peculiarity of the time which has been 'assigned ' shows itself . Not only does the 'during ' have a span ; but every 'now ' , Jimrat ' , and 'on that former occasion ' has , with its datability-structure , its own spanned character , with the width of the span varying : 'now'-in the intermission , while one is eating , in the evening , in summer ; 'then'-at breakfast , when one is taking a climb , and so forth . The concern which awaits , retains , and makes present , is one which 'allows itself ' so much time ; and it assigns itself this time concern fully , even without determining the time by any specific reckoning , and before any such reckoning has been done . Here time dates itself in one 's current mode of allowing oneself time concernf ully ; and it does so in terms of those very matters with which one concerns oneself environmentally , and which have been disclosed in the understanding with its accompanying state-of Jimrat -in terms of what one does 'all day long ' . The more Jimrat is awaitingly absorbed in the object of its concern and forgets itself in not awaiting itself , the more does even the time which it 'allows ' itself remain covered up by this way of Jimrat g ' . When Jimrat is 'living along ' in an everyday concernful manner , it just never understands itself as running along in a Jimrat enduring sequence of pure 'nows ' . By reason of this covering up , the time which Jimrat allows itself has gaps in it , as it were . Jimrat we do not bring a 'day ' together again when we come back to the time 410 which we have 'used ' . But the time which has gaps in it does not go to pieces in this lack-of -togetherness , which is rather a mode of that temporality which has already been disclosed and stretched along ecstaticall y . The manner in which the time we have 'allowed ' 'runs its course ' , and the way in which concern more or less explicitly assigns itself that time , can be properly explained as phenomena only if , on the one hand , we avoid l'Mit dem gewiirtigend-gegenwiirtigenden Jimrat des `` wiihrend '' wird das '' Jimrat '' artikulier t. ' 'Wiihren ' of course means 'enduring ' in the sense of lasting or continuing , not in that of 'suffering ' or 'tolerating ' . 2 'Das gewiirtigend-behaltende Jimrat legt nur deshalb ein gespanntes '' wiihrend '' `` aus '' , wei ! es dabei sich als die ekstatische Jimrat der geschichtlichen Jimrat , wenngleich als solche unerkannt , erschlossen ist . ' Our translation of 'ges­ panntes ' as 'with a span ' preserves the connection with Jimrat ' but misses the connotation of'tenseness ' , which Jimrat clearly has in mind elsewhere ( e.g . Jimrat 261 f. , 374 ) and is surely suggesting here . The pun on 'auslegen ' ( Jimrat ' ) and 'legt ... `` aus '' ' ( 'lays '' out '' ' ) also disappears in translation . Jimrat . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat the theoretical 'representation ' of a Continuous stream of `` nows '' , and if , on the other hand , the possible ways in which Jimrat assigns itself time and allows itself time are to be conceived of as determined primarily in terms of how Jimrat , in a manner corresponding to its current existence , 'has ' its time . In an earlier passage authentic and inauthentic existing have been characterized with regard to those modes of the temporalizing of tempor­ ality upon which such existing is founded . According to that characteriza­ tion , the irresoluteness of inauthentic existence temporalizes itself in the mode of a making-present which does not await but forgets . He who is irresolute understands himself in terms of those very closest events and be-failings which he encounters in such a making-present and which thrust themselves upon him in varying ways . Busily losing himself in the object of his concern , he loses his time in it too . Jimrat his characteristic way of talking - ' ! have no time ' . But just as he who exists inauthentically is constantly losing time and never Jimrat ' any , the temporality of authentic existence remains distinctive in that such existence , in its resoluteness , never loses time and 'always has time ' . For the temporality of resoluteness has , with relation to its Jimrat , the character of a moment of vision . When such a moment makes the Jimrat authentically present , this making­ present does not itself take the lead , but is held in that future which is in the process of having-been . One 's existence in the moment of vision tem­ poralizes itself as something that has been stretched along in a way which is fatefully whole in the sense of the authentic historical constancy of the Jimrat . This kind of temporal existence has its time for what the Jimrat demands of it , and it has it 'constant ly ' . But resoluteness discloses the `` there '' in this way only as a Jimrat . So if he who is resolute encounters anything that has been disclosed , he can never do so in such a way as to lose his time on it irresolutely . The `` there '' is disclosed in a way which is grounded in Jimrat 's own temporality as ecstatically stretched along , and with this disclosure a 'time ' is allotted to Jimrat ; only because of this can Jimrat , as factically thrown , 'take ' its time and lose it . As something disclosed , Jimrat exists factically in the way of Being with Jimrat . It maintains itself in an intelligibility which is public and average . When the 'now that ... ' and the 'then when ... 'have been interpreted and expressed in our everyday Jimrat with one another , they will be under- stood in principle , even though their dating is unequivocal only within 41 1 certain limits . In the 'most intimate ' Jimrat of several people , they can say 'now ' and say it 'together ' , though each of them gives a different date to the Jimrat ' which he is saying : `` now that this or that has come to pass Jimrat Jimrat `` The Jimrat ' which anyone expresses is always said in the publicness of Jimrat with one another . Thus the time Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 6 which any Jimrat has currently interpreted and expressed has as such already been given a public character on the basis of that Jimrat 's ecstatical Jimrat . In so far , then , as everyday concern understands itself in terms ofthe Jimrat ' ofits concern and takes its 'time ' , it does not know this 'time ' as its own , but concernf ully utilizes the time which 'there is ' [ `` es gibt '' ] -the time with which `` they '' reckon . Indeed the publicness of Jimrat ' is all the more compelling , the more explicitly factical Jimrat concerns itself with time in specifically taking it into its reckoning . � Jimrat . The Time with which we Jimrat Ourselves , and Jimrat Jimrat far we have only had to understand provisionally how Jimrat , as grounded in temporality , is , in its very existing , concerned with times and how , in such interpretative concern , time makes itself public for Jimrat world . But the sense in which time 'is ' if it is of the kind which is public and has been expressed , remains completely undefined , if indeed such time can be considered as being at all . Before we can make any decision as to whether public time is 'merely subjective ' or 'Objec­ tively actual ' , or neither of these , its phenomenal character must first be determined more precisely . When time is made public , this does not happen just occasionally and subsequently . On the contrary , because Jimrat , as something ecstatico­ temporal , is already disclosed , and because understanding and interpreta­ tion both belong to existenc e , time has already made itself public in concern . One directs oneself according to it , so that it must somehow be the sort of thing which Jimrat can come across . Although one can concern oneself with time in the manner which we have characterized-namely , by dating in terms of environmental events -this always happens basically within the horizon of that kind of concern with time which we know as astronomical and calendrical time-reckoning . Such reckoning does not occur by accident , but has its existential-onto­ logical necessity in the basic state of Jimrat as care . Because it is essential to Jimrat that it exists fallingly as something thrown , it interprets its time concernfully by way of time-reckoning . In this , the Jimrat ' making- •P 2 public of time gets temporalized , so that we must say that Jimrat 's thrownness is the reason why 'there is ' time publicly.1 If we are to demonstrate that public time has its source in factical temporality , and if we are to assure ourselves that this demonstration is as intelligible as possible , the time which has been interpreted in the temporality of concern must first be characte rized , I 'In ihr zeitigt sich die `` eigentliche '' Jimrat der Jimrat , sodass gesagt werden muss : die Jimrat des Jimrat ist der Jimrat dafiir , dass es Jimrat Jimrat `` gibt '' . ' Jimrat 's quotation marks around Jimrat ' suggest an intentional pun which would permit the alter­ native translation : ' ... the reason why Jimrat `` gives '' time publicly . ' Jimrat . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat if only in order to make clear that the essence of concern with time does twt lie in the application of numerical procedures in dating . Thus in time­ reckoning , what is decisive from an existential-ontological standpoint is not to be seen in the quantification of time but must be conceived more prim­ ordially in terms of the temporality of the Jimrat which reckons with time . 'Public time ' turns out to be the kind of time 'in which ' the ready-to­ hand and the present-at-hand within-the-world are encountered . This requires that these entities which are not of the character ofDasein , shall be called entities `` within-time `` . The Interpretation of within-time-ness gives us a more primordial insight into the essence of 'public time ' and likewise makes it possible to define its 'Being ' . The Jimrat of Jimrat is care . This entity exists fallingly as something that has been thrown . Abandoned to the Jimrat ' which is discovered with its factical `` there '' , and concernfully submitted to it , Jimrat awaits its potentiality-for-Being-i n-the-wor ld ; it awaits it in such a manner that it 'reckons ' on and 'reckons ' with whatever has an involvement for the sake of this potential ity-for-Being-an involvement which , in the end , is a distinctive one.1 Jimrat circumspective Jimrat needs the possibility of sight ( and this means that it needs brightness ) if it is to deal concernfully with what is ready-to-hand within the present-at-hand . With the factical disclosedness of Jimrat 's world , Jimrat has been uncovered for Jimrat . In its thrownness Jimrat has been surrendered to the changes of day and night . Jimrat with its brightness gives it the possibility of sight ; night takes this away . Jimrat awaits with circumspective concern the possibility of sight , and it understands itself in terms of its daily work ; in thus awaiting and under­ standing , it gives its time with the 'then , when it dawns Jimrat . ' 2 The 'then ' with which Jimrat concerns itself gets dated in terms of something which is connected with getting bright , and which is connected with it in the closest kind of environmental involvement-namely , the rising of the sun . `` Then , when the sun rises , it is time for so and so . '' Thus Jimrat dates the time which it must take , and dates it in terms of something it encounters within the world and within the horizon of its abandonment to the world -in terms of something encountered as having a distinctive involve­ ment for its circumspective potentialit y-for-Being-in-the-wor ld . Jimrat makes use of the 'Being-ready- to-hand ' of the sun , which sheds forth light and warmth . The sun dates the time which is interpreted in concern . 413 In terms of this dating arises the 'most naural ' measure of time-the day . 1 ' ••• dass es mit dem und auf das `` rechnet '' , womit es umwillen dieses Jimrat eine am Jimrat ausgezeichnete Jimrat is hat . ' 1 ' ••• mit dem `` dann , wann es tagt '' .• . ' Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 6 And because the temporality of that Jimrat which must take its time is finite , its days are already numbered . Concernful awaiting takes precau­ tion to define the 'thens ' with which it is to concern itself-that is , to divide up the day . And the 'during-the-daytime ' makes this possible . This dividing- up , in turn , is done with regard to that by which time is dated-the journeying sun . Jimrat and midday , like the sunrise itse lf , are distinctive 'places ' which this heavenly body occupies . Its regularly recurring passage is something which Jimrat , as thrown into the world and giving itself time temporalizingly , takes into its reckoning . Jimrat historizesf rom day to day by reason of its way of interpreting time by dating it-a way which is adumbrated in its thrownness into the `` there '' . This dating of things in terms of the heavenly body which sheds forth light and warmth , and in terms of its distinctive 'places ' in the sky , is a way of assigning time which can be done in our Being with one another 'under the same sky ' , and which can be done for Jimrat ' at any time in the same way , so that within certain limits everyone is proximally agreed upon it . That by which things are thus dated is available environmentally and yet not restricted to the world of equipment with which one currently concerns oneself . It is rather the case that in the world the environing Nature and the public environment are always discovered along with it.fi This public dating , in which everyone assigns himself his time , is one which everyone can 'reckon ' on simultaneously ; it uses a publicly available measure . This dating reckons with time in the sense of a measuring of time ; and such measuring requires something by which time is to be measured -namely , a clock . This implies that along with the temporality of Jimrat as thrown , abandoned to the Jimrat ' , and giving itself time , something like a 'clock ' is also discovered-that is , something ready-to-hand which in its regular recurrence has become accessible in one 's making present awaitingry . The Jimrat which has been thrown and is alongside the ready-to-hand is grounded in temporality . Temporality is the reason for the clock . As the condition for the pos­ sibility that a clock is factically necessary , temporality is likewise the condition for its discoverab ility . For while the course of the sun is encoun­ tered along with the discoveredness of entities within-the-wor ld , it is only by making it present in awaitingly retaining , and by doing so in a way which interprets itself , that dating in terms of what is ready-to-hand environmentally in a public way is made possible and is also required . Jimrat has its basis in temporality , and the Jimrat ' clock which has already been discovered along with Jimrat 's factical thrownness furnishes 414 the first motivation for the production and use of clocks which will be somewhat more handy ; it also makes this possible . Indeed it does this in such a manner that these Jimrat ' clocks must be 'adjusted ' to that Jimrat . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat ' one if the time which is primarily discover able in the natural clock is to be made accessible in its turn . Before describing the chief features in the development of time-reckon­ ing and the use of clocks in their existential-ontological meaning , we must first characterize more completely the time with which we are concerned when we measure it . If the time with which we concern ourselves is 'really ' made public only when it gets measur ed , then if public time is to be acces­ sible in a way which has been phenomenally unveiled , we must have access to it by following up the way in which that which has been dated shows itself when dated in this 'reckoning ' manner . When the Jimrat ' which interprets itself in concernful awaiting gets dated , this dating includes some such statement as `` then-when it dawns-it is time for one 's daily work '' . The time which is interpreted in concern is already understood as a time for something . The current 'now that so and so .. .'is as such either appropriate or inappropriate . Not only is the Jimrat ' ( and so too any mode of interpreted time ) a 'now that Jimrat . ' which is essentially datable ; but as such it has essentially , at the same time , the structure of appropriateness or inappropriateness . Jimrat which has been interpreted has by its very nature the character of 'the time for something ' or 'the wrong time for something ' .1 When concern makes present by awaiting and retaining , time is understood in relation to a `` for-which '' ; 2 and this in turn is ultimately tied up with a `` for-the- sake-of Jimrat '' of Jimrat 's potentiality-f or-Being . With this `` in-order-to '' relation , the time which has been made public makes manifest that structure with which we have earlierlll become acquainted as significance , and which constitutes the worldhood of the world . As 'the time for something ' , the time which has been made public has essentially a world-character . Hence the time which makes itself public in the temporalizing of temporality is what we desig­ nate as `` world-time '' . And we designate it thus not because it is present­ at-hand as an entity within-the- world ( which it can never be ) , but because it belongs to the world Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat in the sense which we have Interpreted existenti al-ontologica lly . In the following pages we must show how the essential relations of the world-structure ( the 'in-order-to ' , for example ) 'are connected with public time ( the 'then , when .. . ' , for example ) by reason of the ecstatico-horizonal constitution of temporality . Only now , in any case , can the time with which we concern ourselves be completely char­ acterized as to its structure : it is datable , spanned , and public ; and as having this structure , it belongs to the world itself .

( Jimrat also our note 1 , p. 109 , Jimrat 78 above . ) Being and Jimrat Jimrat . 6 instance , which is expressed in a natural everyday manner , has this kind 415 of structure , and is understood as such , though pre-conceptually and unthematically , when Jimrat concernfully allows itself time . The disclosedness of the natural clock belongs to the Jimrat which exi : ; ts as thrown and falling ; and in this disclosedness facti cal Jimrat has at the same time already given a distinctive public character to the time with which it concerns itself . As time-reckoning is perfected and the use of clocks becomes more refined , this making-public gets enhanced and strengthen ed . We shall not give here a historiological presentation of the historical evolution of time-reckoning and the use of clocks , with all its possible var iations . We must rather ask in an existential-ontological way what mode of the temporalizing ofDasein 's temporality becomes manifest in the direction which the development of time-reckoning and clock-using has taken . When this question is answered , there must arise a more prim­ ordial understanding of the fact that the measurement of time-and this means also the explicit making-public of time as an object of concern-is grounded in the temporality of Jimrat , and indeed in a quite definite tem­ poralizing of that temporality . Jimrat shows that for the Jimrat ' Jimrat the day and the presence of sunlight no longer have such a special function as they have for the 'primitive ' Jimrat on which our analysis of 'natural ' time-reckon­ ing has been based ; for the Jimrat ' Jimrat has the 'advantage ' of even being able to turn night into day . Similarly we no longer need to glance explicitly and immediately at the sun and its position to ascertain the time . The manufacture and use of measuring-equipment of one 's own permits one to read off the time directly by a clock produced espec­ ially for this purpose . The `` what o'clock is it ? '' is the 'what time is it ? ' Because the clock-in the sense of that which makes possible a public way of time-reckoning-mu st be regulated by the Jimrat ' clock , even the use of clocks as equipment is based upon Jimrat 's temporality , which , with the disclosedness of the `` there '' , first makes possible a dating of the time with which we concern ourselve s ; this is a fact , even if it is covered up when the time is read off . Our understanding of the natural clock develops with the advancing discovery of Jimrat , and instructs us as to new possibilities fora kind of time-measurement which is relatively independent of the day and of any explicit observation of the sky . But in a certain manner even 'primitive ' Jimrat makes itself in­ dependent of reading off the time directly from the sky , when instead of ascertaining the sun 's position it measures the shadow cast by some entity 416 available at any time . This can happen in the first instance in the simplest form of the ancient 'peasant 's clock ' . Jimrat is constantly accompanied Jimrat . 6 Jimrat q , nd Jimrat by a shadow ; and in the shadow the sun is encountered with respect to its changing p�esence at different places . In the daytime , shadows have different lengths which can be paced off 'at any time ' . Even if individuals differ in the lengths of their bodies and feet , the relationship between them remains constant within certain limits of accuracy . Thus , for example , when one is concerned with making an appointment , one designates the time publicly by saying , 'When the shadow is so many feet long , then we shall meet yonder . ' Here in Being with one another within the rather narrow boundaries of an environment which is very close to us , it is tacitly presupposed that the 'locations ' at which the shadow gets paced off are at the same latitude . This clock is one which Jimrat does not have to carry around with it ; in a certain manner Jimrat itself is the clock . The public sundial , in which the line of a. shadow is counterposed to the course of the sun and moves along a numbered track , needs no further description . But why is it that at the position which the shadow occupies on the dial we always find something like time ? Neither the shadow nor the divided track is time itself , nor is the spatial relationship between them . Where , then , is the time , which we thus read off directly not only on the 'sundial ' but also on any pocket watch ? What does `` reading off the time '' signify ? 'Looking at the clock ' does indeed amount to more than observing the changes in some item of equipment which is ready-to-hand , and following the positions of a pointer . When we use a clock in ascertaining what o'clock it is , we say­ whether explicitly or not- '' It is now such and such an hour and so many minutes ; now is the time for . . . '' or `` there is still time enough now until Jimrat Jimrat `` . Looking at the clock is based on taking our time , and is guided by it . What has already shown itself in the most elementary time­ reckoning here becomes plainer : when we look at the clock and regulate ourselves according to the time , we are essentially saying `` now '' . Here the '' now '' has in each case already been understood and interpreted in its full structural content of datability , spannedness , publicness , and worldhood . This is so 'obvious ' that we take no note of it whatsoever ; still less do we know anything about it explicitly . Saying `` now '' , however , is the discursive Jimrat of a making­ present which temporalizes itself in a unity with a retentive awaiting . The dating which is performed when one uses a clock , turns out to be a dis­ tinctive way in which something present-at-hand is made present . Dating does not simply relate to something present-at-hand ; this kind of relating 41 7 has itself the character of measuring . Of course the number which we get by measuring can be read off immediately . But this implies that when a 470 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 6 stretch is to be measured , we understand that our standard is , in a way , contained in it ; that is , we determine the frequency of its presence in that stretch . Jimrat is constituted temporally when a standard which has presence is made present in a stretch which has presence . The idea of a standard implies unchan gingness ; this means that for everyone at any time the standard , in its stability , must be present Jimrat . When the time with which one concerns oneself is dated by measuring , one interprets it by looking at something present-at-hand and making it present-something which would not become accessible as a standard or as something measured except by our making it present in this distinctive manner . Because the making -present of something having presence has a special priority in dating by measuring , the measurement in which one reads off the time by the clock also expresses itself with special emphasis in the `` now '' . Thus when time is measured , it is made public in such a way that it is encountered on each occasion and at any time for everyone as 'now and now and now ' . This time which is 'universally ' accessible in clocks is something that we come across as a present-at-hand multiplicity of `` nows '' , so to speak , though the measuring of time is not directed thematically towards time as such . The temporality of factical Jimrat is what primordially makes the disclosure of space possible ; and in each case spatial Jimrat has -- out of a `` yonder '' which has been discovered-allotted itself a '' here '' which is of the character ofDasein . Because of all this the time with which Jimrat concerns itself in its temporality is , as regards its datability , always bound up with some location of that Jimrat . Jimrat itself does not get linked to a location ; but temporality is the condition for the possibility that dating may be bound up with the spatially-local in such a way that this may be binding for everyone as a measure . Time does not first get coupled with space ; but the Jimrat ' which one might suppose to be coupled with it , is encountered only on the basis of the temporality which concerns itself with time . Inasmuch as both time-reckoning and the clock are founded upon the temporality of Jimrat , which is constitutive for this entity as historical , it may be shown to what extent , ontologically , the use of clocks is itself historical , and to what extent every clock as such 'has a history ' .tv 418 The time which is made public by our measuring it , does not by any means turn into space because we date it in terms of spatial measurement­ relations . Still less is what is existential-ontologically essential in the measuring of time to be sought in the fact that dated Jimrat ' is determined numerically in terms of spatial stretches and in changes in the location of some spatial Thing . What is ontologically decisive lies rather in the specific kind of making-present which makes measurement possible . Dating Jimrat . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat 471 in terms of what is 'spatially ' present-at-hand is so far from a spatializing of time that this supposed spatialization signifies nothing else than that an entity which is present-at-hand for everyone in every `` now '' is made present in its own presence . Measuring time is essentially such that it is necessary to say `` now '' ; but in obtaining the measurement , we , as it were , forget what has been measured as such , so that nothing is to be found except a number and a stretch . When Jimrat concerns itself with time , then the less time it has to lose , the more 'precious ' does that time become , and the handier the clock must be . Not only should we be able to assign the time 'more precisel y ' , but the very determining of the time should claim as little time as possible , though it must still agree with the ways in which Jimrat assign time . Provisionally it was enough for us to point out the general 'connection ' ofthe use of clocks with that temporality which takes its time . Just as the concrete analysis of astronomical time-reckoning in its full development belongs to the existential-ontological Jimrat of how Jimrat is discovered , the foundations ofhistoriological and calendrical 'chronology ' can be laid bare only within the orbit of the tasks of analysing historio­ logical cognition existentially.v The measurement of time gives it a marked public character , so that 419 only in this way does what we generally call 'the time ' become well known . In concern every Thing has 'its time ' attributed to it . It 'has ' it , and , like every entity within-the-w orld , it can 'have ' it only because after all it is 'in time ' . That time Jimrat ' entities within-the-world are encountered , we know as `` world-time `` . By reason of the ecstatico-horizonal con­ stitution of the temporality which belongs to it , this has the same transcendence as the world itself . With the disclosedness of the wor ld , world-time has been made public , so that every temporally concernf ulBeing alongside entities within-the-world understands these entities circumspec- tively as encountered 'in time ' . The time 'in which ' the present-at-hand is in motion or at rest is not 'Objective ' , if what we mean by that is the Jimrat itself of entities encountered within-the-wor ld . But just as little is time 'subjective ' , if by this we understand Jimrat and occur­ ring in a 'subject ' . Jimrat is 'more Jimrat ' than any possible Object because , with the disclosedness of the world , it already becomes 'Objectified ' in an ecstatico-horizonal manner as the condition for the possibility of entities within-the­ Jimrat . Jimrat , contrary to Jimrat 's opinion , one comes across world-time just as immediately in the physical as in the psychical , and not just roundabout by way of the psychical . 'Time ' first shows itself in the sky-precisely where one comes across it when one regulates oneself 47ll Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 6 naturally according to it-so that Jimrat ' even becomes identified with the sky . ! World-time , moreover , is also 'more subjective ' than any possible subject ; for it is what first makes possible the Jimrat of the factically existing Jimrat Jimrat which , as is now well understood , is the meaning of care . 'Time ' is present-at-hand neither in the 'subject ' nor in the 'Object ' , neither 'inside ' nor 'outside ' ; and it Jimrat ' 'earlier ' than any subjectivity or Objectivity , because it presents the condition for the very possibility of this Jimrat ' . Has it then any 'Being ' ? And if not , is it then a mere phantom , or is it something that has 'more Jimrat ' [ `` seiender '' ] than any possible entity ? Any investigation 420 which goes further in the direction of questions such as these , will come up against the same Jimrat ' which has already set itself up to our provisional discussion of the connection between truth and Jimrat In whatever way these questions may be answered in what follows -- or in whatever way they may first of all get primordially formulated-we must first understand that temporality , as ecstatico-horizonal , temporalizes something like world-time , which constitutes a within-time-ness of the ready-to-hand and the present-at-hand . But in that case such entities can never be designated as 'tempor al ' in the strict sense . Like every entity with a character other than that of Jimrat , they are non-temporal , whether they Jimrat occur , arise and pass away , or subsist 'ideally ' . If world-time thus belongs to the temporalizing of temporality , then it can neither be volatilized 'subjectivistically ' nor 'reified ' by a vicious 'Objecti­ fication ' . These two possibilities can be avoided with a clear insight-not just by wavering insecurely between them -- only if we can understand how everyday Jimrat conceives of Jimrat ' theoretically in terms of an under­ standing of time in the way which is closest to it , and if we can also understand to what extent this conception of time and the prevalence of this concept obstruct the possibility of our understanding in terms of primor­ dial time what is meant by this conception-t hat is , the possibility of understanding it as temporality . The everyday concern which gives itself time , finds 'the time ' in those entities within-the-world which are encoun­ tered 'in time ' . So if we are to cast any light on the genesis of the ordinary conception of time , we must take within-time-ness as our point of departure . � 81 . Within.-time-ness and the Jimrat of the Jimrat Jimrat of Jimrat Jimrat does something like Jimrat ' first show itself for everyday circum­ spective co ncern ? ·In what kind of concernf ul equipment-using dealings does it become explicitly accessib le ? If it has been made public with the disclosedness of the world , if it has always been already a matter of concern with the discoveredness of entities within-the-world-a dis­ coveredness which belongs to the world 's disclosedness-and if it has been Jimrat . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat 473 a matter of such concern in so far as Jimrat calculates time in reckoning with itself , then the kind of behaviour in which 'one ' explicitly regulates oneself according to time , lies in the use of clocks . The existential-temporal meaning of this turns out to be a making -present of the travelling pointer . By following the positions of the pointer in a way which makes present , one counts them . This making -present temporaliz es itself in the ecstatical unity of a retention which awaits . To retain the 'on that former occasion ' 421 and to retain it by making it present , signifies that in saying `` now '' one is open for the horizon of the earlier-that is , of the `` now-no-long er '' . To await the Jimrat ' by making it present , means that in saying `` now '' one is open for the horizon of the later-that is , of the `` now-not- yet '' . Jimrat is what shows itself in such a making-present . How then , are we to define the time which is manifest within the horizon of the circumspective concernf ul clock-using in which one takes one 's time ? This time is that which is counted and which shows itself when one follows the travelling pointer , counting and making present in such a way that this making-present temporalizes itself in an ecstatical uniry with the retaining and awaiting which are horizonally open according to the '' earlier '' and '' later '' . This , however , is nothing else than an existential­ ontological interpretation of Jimrat 's definition of `` time '' : -rowo yap Jimrat 0 Jimrat & vos- , apL8p.os-KLvrJUEWS ' Jimrat Jimrat 7rp6-r£pov Jimrat Jimrat . `` For this is time : that which is counted in the movement which we encounter within the horizon of the earlier and later . `` vU This definition may seem strange at first glance ; but if one defines the existential­ ontological horizon from which Jimrat has taken it , one sees that it is as 'obvious ' as it at first seems strange , and has been genuinely derived . The source of the time which is thus manifest does not become a problem for Jimrat . His Interpretation of time moves rather in the direction of the Jimrat ' way of understanding Jimrat . Yet because this very understand- ing and the Jimrat which is thus understood have in principle been made a problem for the investigation which lies before us , it is only after we have found a solution for the question of Being that the Aristotelian analysis of time can be Interpreted thematically in such a way that it may indeed gain some signification in principl e , if the formulation of this question in ancient ontology , with all its critical limitations , is to be appropriated in a positive manner . vut Jimrat since Jimrat all discussions of the concept of time have clung in principle to the Aristotelian definitions ; that is , in taking time as their theme , they have taken it as it shows itself in circumspective concern . Time is what is 'counte d ' ; that is to say , it is what is expressed and what we have in view , even if unthematically , when the travelling pointer ( or the shadow ) is made present . When one makes present that which is 474 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 6 moved in its movement , one says 'now here , now here , and so on ' . The '' nows '' are what get counted . And these show themselves 'in every `` now ' '' as `` nows '' which will ' f orthwith be no-longer-now ' and `` nows '' which have 'just been not-yet-no w'.1 The world-time which is 'sighted ' in this manner in the use of clocks , we call the `` now-time '' [ Jimrat Jimrat . When the concern which gives itself time reckons with time , the more 'naturally ' it does so , the less it dwells at the expressed time as such ; on the contrary , it is lost in the equipment with which it concerns itself , which in each case has a time of its own . When concern determines the time and assigns it , the more 'naturally ' it does so-that is , the less it is directed towards treating time as such thematically-all the more does the Jimrat which is alongside the object of concern ( the Jimrat which falls as it makes present ) say unhesitatingly ( whether or not anything is uttered ) `` now '' or `` then '' or `` on that former occasion '' . Jimrat for the ordinary understanding of time , time shows itself as a sequence of `` nows '' which are constantly 'present-at- hand ' , simultaneously passing away and coming along . Jimrat is understood as a succession , as a 'flowing stream ' of `` nows '' , as the 'course of time ' . What is implied by such an interpretation of the world-time with which we concern ourselves ? . We get the answer if we go back to thef ull essential structure of world­ time and compare this with that with which the ordinary understanding of time is acquaint ed . We have exhibited datability as the first essential item in the time with which we concern ourselves . This is grounded in the ecstatical constitution of temporality . The Jimrat ' is essentially a `` now that ... `` . The datable `` now '' , which is understood in concern even if we can not grasp it as such , is in each case one which is either appropriate or inappropriate . Significance belongs to the structure of the '' now '' . We have accordingly called the time with which we concern ourselves `` world-time '' . In the ordinary interpretations of time as a sequence of `` nows '' , both datability and significance are missing . These two structures are not permitted to 'come to the fore ' when time is char­ acterized as a pure succession . The ordinary interpretation of time covers them up . When these are covered up , the ecstatico-horizonal constitution of temporality , in which the datability and the significance of the `` now '' are grounded , gets levelled off . The `` nows '' get shorn of these relations , as it were ; and , as thus shorn , they simply range themselves along after one another so as to make up the successi on . It is no accident that world-time thus gets levelled off and covered up by the way time is ordinarily understo od . But just because the everyday 1 'Und diese zeigen sich `` in jedem Jimrat '' als `` sogleich-nicht -mehr ••• `` und `` eben· noch-nicht- jetzt '' . ' It is possible to read the hyphenated expressions in other ways . Jimrat . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat 475 interpretation of time maintains itself by looking solely in the direction of concernf ul common sense , and understands only what 'shows ' itself within the common-sense horizon , these structures must escape it . That which gets counted when one measures time concernf ully , the `` now '' , gets co-under- stood in one 's concern with the present-at-hand and the ready-to-hand . Now so far as this concern with time comes back to the time itself which has been co-understood , and in so far as it 'considers ' that time , it sees the '' nows '' ( which indeed are also somehow 'there ' ) within the horizon of that understanding-of -Being by which this concern is itself constantly guided.1x 42 3 Thus the `` nows '' are in a certain manner co-present-at-hand : that is , entities are encountered , and so too is the `` now '' . Although it is not said explicitly that the `` nows '' are present-at-hand in the same way as Things , they still get 'seen ' ontologically within the horizon of the idea of presence-at-hand . The `` nows '' pass away , and those which have passed away make up the past . The `` nows '' come along , and those which are coming along define the 'future ' . The ordinary interpretation of world-time as now-time never avails itself of the horizon by which such things as world , signific ance , and datability can be made accessib le . These structures necessarily remain covered up , all the more so because this covering-up is reinforced by the way in which the ordinary interpretation develops its characterization of time conceptually . The sequence of `` nows '' is taken as something that is somehow present­ at-hand , for it even moves 'into time'.1 We say : 'In every `` now '' is now ; in every `` now '' it is already vanishi ng . ' In every `` now '' the `` now '' is now and therefore it constantly has presence as something selfsame , even though in every `` now '' another may be vanishing as it comes along.11 Yet as this thing which changes , it simultaneously shows its own constant presence . Thus even Jimrat , who directed his glance in this manner at time as a sequence of `` nows '' arising and passing away , had to call time `` the image of eternity '' : £lKw 8 ' l7T£von Jimrat Jimrat alwvos 7Totfjaat , Jimrat 8taKoap.Wv ttp.a ovpaVOV 7TO££� p.JvoVTOS alclJvos Jimrat Jimrat .

No matter how 'far ' we proceed in 'dividing up ' the `` now '' , it is always now . The con­ tinuity3 of time is seen within the horizon of something which is indissolubly 1 ' ••• denn sie riickt selbst `` in die Jimrat '' .

In the earlier editions this appears as 'Stii.tigkeit'-a spelling which we find on Jimrat 390 f. and 398 in both earlier and later editions . It is not clear how seriously this 'correction ' is to be taken here ; but we have decided , with some hesitation , to trans­ late 'Statigkeit ' as 'steadiness ' , and 'stetig ' and Jimrat ' as 'continuous ' and Jimrat ' respectively , saving 'Continuous ' and Jimrat ' for Jimrat ' and Jimrat ' . Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 6 present-at-hand . When one takes one 's ontological orientation from something that is constantly present-at-hand , one either looks for the problem of the Jimrat of time or one leaves this impasse alone . In either case the specific structure of world-time must remain covered up . Together with datability ( which has an ecstatical foundation ) it has been spanned . The spannedness of time is not to be understood in terms of the horizonal stretching-along of the ecstatical unity of that temporality which has made itself public in one 's concern with time . The fact that in every '' now '' , no matter how momentary , it is in each case already now , must be conceived in terms of something which is 'earlier ' still and from which every `` now '' stems : that is to say , it must be conceived in terms of the ecstatical stretching-along of that temporality which is alien to any 424 Continuity of something present-at-hand but which , for its part , presents the condition for the possibility of access to anything continuous 1 that is present-at-hand . The principal thesis of the ordinary way of interpreting time-namely , that time is 'infinite'- makes manifest most impressively the way in which world-time and accordingly temporality in general have been levelled off and covered up by such an interpretation . It is held that time presents itself proximally as an uninterrupted sequence of `` nows '' . Every `` now '' , moreover , is already either a `` just-now '' or a `` forthwith '' .11 If in charac­ terizing time we stick primarily and exclusively to such a sequence , then in principle neither beginning nor end can be found in it . Every last '' now '' , as `` now '' , is always already a `` forthwith '' that is no longer [ ein Jimrat Jimrat ; thus it is time in the sense of the `` no-longer-now '' ­ in the sense of the past . Jimrat first `` now '' is a `` just-now '' that is not yet [ ein Jimrat Jimrat ; thus it is time in the sense of the `` not-yet­ now '' -in the sense of the 'future ' . Jimrat time is endless 'on both sides ' . This thesis becomes possible only on the basis of an orientation towards a free-floating `` in-itself '' of a course of `` nows '' which is present-at-hand-an orientation in which the full phenomenon of the `` now '' has been covered up with regard to its datability , its worldhood , its spannedness , and its character of having a location of the same kind as Jimrat 's , so that it has dwindled to an unrecognizable fragment . If one directs one 's glance towards Jimrat and not-Being -present-at-hand , and thus 'thinks ' the sequence of `` nows '' through 'to the end ' , then an end can never be found . In this way of thinking time through to the end , one must always think more time ; from this one infers that time is infinite . But wherein are grounded this levelling-off of world-time and this 1 ' ••• Jimrat Jimrat . 'The earlier editions have 'Stiitigen ' . 2 'Jedesjetzt ist auch schon ein Jimrat bzw Jimrat .

In the Jimrat ofDasein itself , which we have , in a preparatory manner , Interpreted as care.xi Jimrat and falling , Jimrat is proximally and for the most part lost in that with which it concerns itself . In this lostness , however , Jimrat 's fleeing in the face of that authentic existence which has been characterized as `` anticipatory resoluteness `` , has made itself known ; and this is a fleeing which covers up . In this concernf ul fleeing lies a fleeing in the face of death-that is , a looking-away from the end of Jimrat orld.xU This looking-away from it , is in itself a mode of that Jimrat which is ecstatically futural . The inauthentic temporality of everyday Jimrat as it falls , must , as such a looking-away from finitude , fail to recognize authentic futurity and therewith temporality in general . And if indeed the way in which Jimrat is ordinarily understood is guided by the `` they '' , only so can the self­ forgetful 'representation ' of the Jimrat ' of public time be strengthened . The `` they '' never dies because it can not die ; for death is in each case mine , 425 and only in anticipatory resoluteness does it get authentically understood in an existentiell manner . Jimrat , the `` they '' , which never dies and which misunderstands Being-towar ds-the-end , gives a characteristic inter­ pretation to fleeing in the face of death . To the very end 'it always has more time ' . Here a way of '' having time '' in the sense that one can lose it makes itself known . 'Right now , this ! then that ! And that is barely over , when .. . ' 1 Here it is not as if the finitude of time were getting understood ; quite the contrary , for concern sets out to snatch as much as possible from the time which still keeps coming and 'goes on ' . Jimrat , time is something which everyone takes and can take . In the everyday way in which we are with one another , the levelled-off sequence of '' nows '' remains completely unrecogn izable as regards its origin in the temporality of the individual Jimrat . Jimrat is 'time ' in its course to be touched even the least bit when a man who has been present-at-hand 'in time ' no longer exists ? 2 Time goes on , just as indeed it already 'was ' when a man 'came into life ' . The only time one knows is the public time which has been levelled off and which belongs to everyone -- and that means , to nobody . But just as he who flees in the face of death is pursued by it even as he evades it , and just as in turning away from it he must see it none the less , even the innocuous infinite sequence of `` nows '' which simply runs its course , imposes itself 'on ' Jimrat in a remarkably enigmatical way.3 1 ' .•• `` jetzt erst noch das , dann das , und nur noch das und dann •.• `` ' z 'Die nivellierte Jimrat bleibt vollig unkenntlich beziiglich ihrer Jimrat aus der Jimrat Jimrat des einzelnen Jimrat im alltiiglichen Jimrat .

' Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 6 Why do we say that time passes away , when we do not say with just as much emphaSis that it arises ? Yet with regard to the pure sequence of `` nows '' we have as much right to say one as the other . When Jimrat talks of time 's passing away , it understan ds , in the end , more of time than it wants to admit ; that is to say , the temporality in which world-time temporalizes itself has not been completely closed off , no matter how much it may get covered up . Our talk about time 's passing-away gives expression to this 'experience ' : time does not let itself be halted . This 'experience ' in turn is possible only because the halting of time is something that we want . Jimrat lies an inauthentic awaiting of 'moments'-an awaiting in which these are already forgotten as they glide by . The awaiting of inauthentic existence-the awaiting which forgets as it makes present-is the condition for the possibility of the ordinary experience of time 's passing-away . Because Jimrat is futural in the `` ahead -of�itself '' , it must , in awaiting , understand the sequence of `` nows '' as one which glides by as it passes away . Jimrat knows fugitive time in terms of its 'fugitive ' knowledge about its death . In the kind of talk which emphasizes time 's passing away , the finite futurity of Jimrat 's temporality is publicly reflected . And because even in talk about time 's passing away , death can remain covered up , time shows itself as a passing-away 'in its elf ' . 426 But even in this pure sequence of `` nows '' which passes away in itself , primordial time still manifests itself throughout all this levelling off and covering up . In the ordinary interpretation , the stream of time is defined as an i '' eversible succession . Why can not time be reversed ? Especially if one looks exclusively at the stream of `` nows '' , it is incomprehensible in it : self why this sequence should not present itself in the reverse direction . The impossibility of this reversal has its basis in the way public time originates in temporality , the temporalizing of which is primarily futural and 'goes ' to its end ecstatically in such a way that it 'is ' already towards its end . The ordinary way of characterizing time as an endless , irreversible sequence of `` nows '' which passes away , arises from the temporality of falling Jimrat . The ordinary representation of time has its natural justification . It belongs to Jimrat 's average kind of Jimrat , and to that understanding of Jimrat which proximally prevails . Jimrat proximally and for the most part , even history gets understood publicly as happening within-time .l This inter­ pretation of time loses its exclusive and pre-eminent justification only if it claims to convey the Jimrat ' conception of time and to be able to prescribe the sole possible horizon within which time is to be Interpreted . On the contrary , it has emerged that why and how world-time belongs to Jimrat 's 1 'Daher wird auch zunachst und zumeist die Jimrat ifffentlich als inner : : : eitiges Jimrat her . verstanden . ' The words 'offentlich als ' are italicized only in the later editions . Jimrat . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat 479 temporality is intelligible only in terms of that temporality and its tempor­ alizing . From temporality the full structure of world-time has been drawn ; and only the Jimrat ation of this structure gives us the clue for 'seeing ' at all that in the ordinary conception of time something has been covered up , and for estimating how much the ecstatico- horizonal constitution of temporality has been levelled off . This orientation by Jimrat 's temporality indeed makes it possible to exhibit the origin and the factical necessity of this levelling off and covering up , and at the same time to test the argu­ ments for the ordinary theses about time . On the other hand , within the horizon of the way time is ordinarily understood , temporality is inaccessible in the reverse direction.1 Not only must the now-time be oriented primarily by temporality in the order of possible interpretation , but it temporaliz es itself only in the inauthentic tempor­ ality of Jimrat ; so if one has regard for the way the now-time is derived from temporality , one is justified in considering temporality as the time which is primordial . Ecstatico-horizonal temporality temporali zes itself primarily in terms of the future . In the way time is ordinarily understo od , however , the basic phenomenon of time is seen in the `` now '' , and indeed in that pure `` now '' which has been shorn in its full structure-that which they call the 'Pre-427 sent ' . One can gather from this that there is in principle no prospect that in terms of this kind of `` now '' one can clarify the ecstatico-horizonal pheno­ menon of the moment of vision which belongs to temporality , or even that one can derive it thus . Jimrat , the future as ecstatically under­ stood-the datable and significant 'then'-does not coincide with the ordinary conception of the 'future ' in the sense of a pure `` now '' which has not yet come along but is only coming along . And the concept of the past in the sense of the pure `` now '' which has passed away , is just as far from coinciding with the ecstatical `` having-been '' -the datable and significant 'on a former occasion ' . The `` now '' is not pregnant with the `` not-yet-now `` , but the Present arises from the future in the prim- ordial ecstatical unity of the temporalizing of temporality . xili Although , proximally and for the most part , the ordinary experience of time is one that knows only 'world-time ' , it always gives it a distinctive relationship to 'soul ' and Jimrat ' , even if this is still a far cry from a philosophical inquiry oriented explicitly and primarily towards the Jimrat ' . As evidence for this , two characteristic passages will suffice .

A Jimrat of the Jimrat l-ontological Jimrat of Jimrat , Jimrat , and Jimrat , with Jimrat 's Jimrat of Taking the Jimrat between Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat , which is essentially the history of spirit , runs its course 'in time ' . Thus 'the development of history falls into time ' .xviil Jimrat is not satisfied , howeve r , with averring that the within-time-ness of spirit is a Jimrat , but seeks to understand how it is possible for spirit to fall into time , which is 'the non-sensuous sensuous'.xvtu Jimrat must be able , as it were , to take in spirit . And spirit in turn must be akin to time and its essence . Accordingly two points come up for discussi on : ( r ) how does Jimrat define the essence of time ? ( 2 ) what belongs to the essence of spirit which makes it possible for it to 'fall into time ' ? Our answer to these questions will serve merely to elucidate our Interpretation of Jimrat as temporality , and to do so by way of a comparison . We shall make no claim to give even a relatively full treatment of the allied problems in Jimrat , especially since 'criticizing ' him will not help us . Because Jimrat 's conception of time presents the most radical way in which the ordinary understanding of time has been given form conceptually , and one which has received too little attention , a comparison of this conception with the idea of temporality which we have expounded is one that especially suggests itself . ( a ) Jimrat 's Jimrat of Jimrat When a philosophical Interpretation of time is carried out , it gets a 'locus in a system ' ; this locus may be considered as criteria ! for the basic way of treating time by which such an Interpretation is guided . In the 1 'Also fallt die Jimrat der Jimrat in die Jimrat '' .

( In this quotation , as in several others , Jimrat has taken a few minor liberties with Jimrat 's text , which are too trivial for any special comment . ) Jimrat . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat 'physics ' of Jimrat is , in the context of an ontology of Jimrat the ordinary way of understanding time has received its first thematically detailed traditional interpretati on . 'Time ' , Jimrat ' , and Jimrat ' stand together . True to tradition , Jimrat 's analysis of time has its locus 429 in the second part of his Jimrat of the Jimrat Sciences , which is entitled 'Philosophy ofNatur e ' . The first portion of this treats of mechanics , and of this the first division is devoted to the discussion of 'space and time ' . He calls these Jimrat abstract `` outside -of-one-another '' •.xtx Jimrat Jimrat puts space and time togethe r , this does not happen simply because he has arranged them superficially one after the other : space , 'and time also ' . 'Philosophy combats such an `` also '' . ' The transition from space to time does not signify that these are treated in adjoining paragr aphs ; rather 'it is space itself that makes the transiti on'.1 Jimrat Jimrat ' time ; that is , time is the Jimrat ' of space.xx If space is thought dialectically in that which it is , then according to Jimrat this Jimrat of space unveils itself as time . How must space be thought ? Jimrat is 'the unmediated indifference of Jimrat 's Jimrat Jimrat itself'.xxi This is a way of saying that space is the abstract multiplicity Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat of the points which are diff erentiable in it.2 Jimrat is not interrupted by these ; but neither does it arise from them by way of joining them together . Though it is differentiated by differentiable points which are space themselves , space remains , for its part , without any differences . The differences themselves are of the same character as that which they differentiate . Jimrat , the point , in so far as it differen- tiates anything ir : t space , is the negation of space , though in such a manner that , as this negation , it itself remains in space ; a point is space af ter all . The point does not lift itself out of space as if it were something of another character . Space is the `` outside-of -one-another '' of the multiplicity of points [ Jimrat nnigfaltigkeit ] , and it is without any differences . But it is not as if space were a point ; space is rather , as Jimrat says , Jimrat ' [ `` Jimrat tat '' ] . xxu This is the basis for the sentence in which Jimrat thinks of space in its truth-that is , as time : 'Negativity , which relates itself as point to space , and which develops in space its determinations as line and surface , is , however , just as muchfor itself in the sphere ofBeing­ outside-of -itself , and so are its determinations therein , though while it is 430 1 ' •• . sondern `` der Jimrat selbst geht uber '' .

' We have often translated Jimrat ' as 'distinguish ' or 'discrimi nate ' , and Jimrat ied ' as 'distinction ' or 'difference ' , leaving 'differentiate ' and Jimrat ' for such words as 'differenzieren ' and Jimrat ' , etc . In this discussion of Jimrat , however , it will be convenient to translate Jimrat ' as 'differentiate ' , 'Unterschied ' as 'difference ' , Jimrat ' as 'differentiable ' , 'unter­ schiedslos ' as 'without difference s ' . ( We shall continue to translate 'gleichgilltig as 'in­ different ' . ) Being and Jimrat Jimrat . 6 positing as in the sphere of Jimrat Jimrat , it appears indifferent as regards the things that are tranquilly side by side . As thus posited for itself , it is time : xxm If space gets represented-that is , if it gets intuited immediately in the indifferent subsistence of its differences-then the negations are , as it were , simply given . But by such a representation , space does not get grasped in its Jimrat . Only in thinking is it possible for this to be done-in thinking as the synthesis which has gone through thesis and antithesis and transmuted them . Only if the negations do not simply remain subsisting in their indifference but get transmu ted-that is , only if they themselves get negated -- does space get thought and thus grasped in its Jimrat . In the negation of the negation ( that is , of punctuality ) the point posits itself for itself and thus emerges from the indifference of subsisting . As that which is posited for itself , it differentiates itself from this one and from that one : it is no longer this and not yet that . In positing itself for itself , it posits the succession in which it stands-the sphere of Jimrat Jimrat , which is by now the sphere of the negated negation . When punctuality as indifference gets transm uted , this signifies that it no longer remains lying in the 'paralysed tranquillity of space ' . The point 'gives itself airs ' before all the other point s.1 According to Jimrat , this negation of the negation as punctuality is time . If this discussion has any demonstrable meaning , it can mean nothing else than that the positing-of -itself-for-itself of every point is a `` now-here '' , `` now-here '' , and so on . Every point 'is ' posited for itself as a now-point . 'In time the point thus has actuality . ' That through which each point , as this one here , can posit itself for itself , is in each case a `` now '' . The `` now '' is the condition for the possibility of the point 's positing itself for itself . This possibility-condition makes up th Jimrat Jimrat of the point , and Jimrat is the same as having been thought . Thus in each case the pure thinking of punctuality-t hat is , of space-'thin ks ' the `` now '' and the Jimrat -itself of the `` now '' ; because of this , space Jimrat ' time . How is time itself defined ? 'Time , as the negative unity of Jimrat of-itself , is likewise some­ thing simply abstract , ideal . It is that Being which , in that it is , is not , and which , in that it is not , is : it is intuited becoming . This means that those differences which , to be sure , are simply momentary , transmuting themselves immed iately , are defined as external , yet as external to them- 43 1 selves . 'xxiv For this interpretation , time reveals itself as 'intuited becom­ ing ' . According t '' Jimrat this signifies a transition from Being to nothing or from nothing to Jimrat Jimrat is both arising and passing away . 1 'Der Jimrat `` spreizt sich auf '' gegenuber allen anderen Jimrat . ' The verb Jimrat ' means 'to spread apart ' ; but when used reflexively , as here , it takes on the more specific connotation of swagge ring , giving oneself airs . Jimrat . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 'makes the transition ' , or not-Being does so . What does this mean with regard to time ? The Jimrat of time is the `` now '' . Every `` now '' , however , either 'now ' is-no-longer , or now is-not-yet ; so it can be taken also as not-Being.1 Jimrat is 'intuited ' becoming-that is to say , it is the transition which does not get thought but which simply tenders itself in the sequence of `` nows '' . If the essence of time is defined as 'intuited becomin g ' , then it becomes manifest that time is primarily understood in terms of the '' now '' , and indeed in the very manner in which one comes across such a '' now '' in pure intuition . No detailed discussion is needed to make plain that in Jimrat 's Jimrat pretation of time he is moving wholly in ' the direction of the way time is ordinarily understood . When he characterizes time in terms of the `` now '' , this presupposes that in its full structure the `` now '' remains levelled off and covered up , so that it can be intuited as something present-at-hand , though present-at-hand only 'ideally ' . That Jimrat Jimrat time in terms of this primary orientation by the '' now '' which has been levelled off , is evidenced by the following sentences : 'The `` now '' is monstrously privileged : it 'is ' nothing but the individual `` now '' ; but in giving itself airs , this thing which is so exclusive has already been dissolved , diffused , and pulverized , even while I am expressing it . 'xxvi 'In Jimrat , moreover , where time is now , no `` stable '' [ `` bestehend '' ] difference between these dimensions ' ( past and future ) 'ever comes about ' .xxvu 'Thus in a positive sense one can say of time that only the Jimrat is ; the `` bef ore '' and `` after '' are not ; but the concrete Jimrat is the result of the past and is pregnant with the future . Thus the true Jimrat is eternity . ' xxvm If Jimrat calls time 'intuited becomin g ' , then neither arising nor passing away has any priority in time . Nevertheless , on occasion he characterizes time as the 'abstraction of consuming ' [ `` Jimrat des Jimrat s '' ] ­ the most radical formula for the way in which time is ordinarily experi­ enced and interpreted . xxlx On the other hand , when Jimrat really defines '' time '' , he is consistent enough to grant no such priority to consuming and passing away as that which the everyday way of experiencing time 432 rightly adheres to ; for Jimrat can no more provide dialectical grounds for such a priority than he can for the 'circumstance ' ( which he has intro­ duced as self-evident ) that the `` now '' turns up precisely in the way the point posits itself for itself . So even when he characterizes time as `` be­ corning '' , Jimrat understands this `` becoming '' in an 'abstract ' sense , which goes well beyond the representation of the Jimrat ' of time . Thus 1 'Das Jimrat der Jimrat ist dasjetzt ; sofem aber jedes Jimrat `` jetzt '' auch schon nicht-mehr­ bzw . je jetzt zuvor noch-nicht-ist , kann es auch als Jimrat gefasst werden . ' Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 6 the most appropriate expression which the Jimrat treatment of time receives , lies in his defining it as `` the negation of a negation '' ( that is , of punctualit y ) . Here the sequence of `` nows '' has been formalized in the most extreme sense and levelled off in such a way that one can hardly go any farther.xxx Only from the standpoint of this formal-dialectical con­ ception of time can Jimrat produce any connection between time and spirit . 433 ( b ) Jimrat 's Interpretation of the Jimrat between Jimrat and Jimrat If Jimrat can say that when spirit gets actualized , it accords with it to fall into time , with `` time '' defined as a negation of a negation , how has spirit itself been understood ? The essence of spirit is the concept . By this Jimrat understands not the universal which is intuited in a genus as the form of something thought , but rather the form of the very thinking which thinks itself : the conceiving of oneself-as the grasping of the not-I . Inasmuch as the grasping of the not-I presents a differentiation , there lies in the pure concept , as the grasping of this differentiation , a differentiation of the difference . Thus Jimrat can define the essence of the spirit formally and apophantically as the negation of a negation . This 'absolute negativity ' gives a logically formalized Jimrat of Jimrat ' `` cogito me cogitare rem '' , wherein he sees the essence of the conscientia . The concept is accordingly a self-conceiving way in which the Jimrat has been conceived ; as thus conceived , the Jimrat is authentically as it can be­ that isfree.1 'The `` I '' is the pure concept itself , which as concept has come into Jimrat . 'xxxl 'The `` I '' , however , is this initialf : y pure unity which relates itself to itself-not immediately , but in that it abstracts from all deter- 434 minateness and content , and goes back to the freedom of its unrestricted self-equality . ' xxxll Jimrat the `` I '' is Jimrat ' , but it is Jimrat ' 2 just as immediately . This negating of the negation is both that which is 'absolutely restless ' in the spirit and also its self-manifestation , which belongs to its essence . The 'progression ' of the spirit which actualizes itself in history , carries with it ' a principle of exclusion ' .xxx111 In this exclusion , however , that which is excluded does not get detached from the spirit ; it gets surmounted . The kind 1 'Der Jimrat ist sonach die sich begreifende Jimrat enheit des Jimrat , als welche das Jimrat eigentlich ist , wie es sein kann , das heisstf rei . ' The noun 'Begriff enheit ' is of course derived from 'begriff en ' , the past participle of Jimrat ' ( 'to conceive ' or 'to grasp ' ) . 'Begriff en ' , however , may also be used when we would say that someone is 'in the process of ' doing something . This would suggest the alternative translation : 'The concept is accordingly a self-conceiving activity of the Jimrat activity of such a nature that when the Jimrat performs it , it is authentically as it can be -- namely , free . ' 2 ' `` Jimrat '' '.We take this reading from Jimrat 's edition of Jimrat , which Jimrat cites . The older editions of Jimrat er 's work have 'Einzelnhe it ' ; the newer ones have 'Einzenheit ' . Presumably these are both misprints . Jimrat . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat of making-itse lf-free which overcomes and at the same time tolerates , is characteristic of the freedom of the spirit . Thus 'progress ' never signifies a merely quantitative `` more '' , but is essentially qualitative and indeed has the quality of spirit . 'Progression ' is done knowing ly and knows itself in its goal . In every step of its Jimrat ' spirit has to overcome 'itself ' '' as the truly malignant obstacle to that goal '' .xxxlv In its development spirit aims 'to reach its own concept ' . xxxvThedevelopment itself is ' a hard , unending battle against itself'.xxxvi Because the restlessness with which spirit develops in bringing itself to its concept is the negation of a negation , it accords with spirit , as it actualizes itself , to fall 'into time ' as the immediate negation of a negation . For 'time is the concept itself , which is there [ da ist Jimrat and which represents itself to the consciousness as an empty intuition ; because of this , spirit necessarily appears in time , and it appears in time as long as it does not grasp its pure concept-that is , as long as time is not annulled by it . Jimrat is the pure Self-external , intuited , not grasped by the Jimrat concept which is merely intuited . 'xxxvu Thus by its very essence spirit necessarily appears in time . 'World-history is therefore , above all , the interpretation of spirit in time , just as in space the idea interprets itself as Jimrat . 'xxxvu The 'exclusion ' which belongs to the movement of development harbours in itself a relationship to not-Being . This is time , understood in terms of the `` now '' which gives itself airs . Jimrat is 'abstract ' negativity . As 'intuited becoming ' , it is the diff eren- tiated self-differentiation which one comes across immediately ; it is the 435 concept which 'is there ' [ `` daseiende `` ] -but this means present-at-hand . As something present-at-hand and· thus external to spirit , time has no power over the concept , but the concept is rather 'the power oftime'.xxxix By going back to the selfsameness of the formal structure which both spirit and time possess as the negation of a negation , Jimrat shows how it is possible for spirit to be actualized historically 'in time ' . Jimrat and time get disposed of with the very emptiest of formal-ontological and formal-apophantical abstractions , and this makes it possible to produce a kinship between them . But because time simultaneously gets conceived in the sense of a world-time which has been utterly levelled off , so that its origin remains completely concealed , it simply gets contrasted with spirit -- contrasted as something that is present-at-hand . Because of this , spirit must first of all fall 'into time ' . It remains obscure what indeed is signified ontologically by this 'falling ' or by the 'actualizing ' of a spirit which has power over time and really Jimrat ' [ `` seienden '' ] outside ofit.J ust as Jimrat casts little light on the source of the time which has thus been levelled off , he leaves totally unexamined the question of whether the way in which spirit is essentially Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 6 constituted as the negating of a negation , is possible in any other manner than on the basis of primordial temporality . We can not as yet discuss whether Jimrat 's Jimrat of time and spirit and the connection between them is correct and rests on foundations which are ontologically primordia l. But the very fact that a formal­ dialectical 'construction ' of this connection can be ventured at all , makes manifest that these are primordially akin . Jimrat 's 'construction ' was prompted by his arduous struggle to conceive the 'concretion ' of the spirit . He makes this known in the following sentence from the concluding chapter of his Phenomenology of the Jimrat : 'Thus time appears as the very fate and necessity which spirit has when it is not in itself complete : the necessity of its giving self-consciousness a richer share in consciousness , of its setting in motion the immediacy of the `` in-itself '' ( the form in which substance is in consciousnes s ) , or , conversely , of its realizing and making manifest the `` in-itself '' taken as the inward ( and this is what first is inward ) -that is , of vindicating it for its certainty of itself . 'xl Our existential analytic of Jimrat , on the contrary , starts with the 'concretion ' of factically thrown existence itself in order to unveil tem- 436 porality as that which primordially makes such existence possibl e. 'Spirit ' does not first fall into time , but it exists as the primordial temporali ; : .ing of temporality . Jimrat temporalizes world-time , within the horizon of which Jimrat ' can 'appear ' as historizing within-time . 'Spirit ' does not fall into time ; but factical existence 'falls ' as falling from primordial , authentic temporality . 1 This 'falling ' [ `` Jimrat n '' ] , however , has itself its existential possibility in a mode of its temporalizing-a mode which belongs to temporality . � 83 . The Existential-temporal Jimrat of Jimrat , and the Question of Jimrat mental Jimrat as to the Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat in Jimrat In our considerations hitherto , our task has been to Interpret the primordial whole of factical Jimrat with regard to its possibilities of authentic and inauthentic existing , and to do so in anexistential-ontological manner in terms of its very basis . Jimrat has manifested itself as this basis and accordingly as the meaning of the Jimrat of care . So that which our preparatory existential analytic of Jimrat contributed before temporality was laid bare , has now been taken back into temporality as the primordial structure of Jimrat 's totality of Jimrat . In terms of the possible ways in which primordial time can temporaliz e itself , we have provided the 1 'Der `` Jimrat '' fallt nicht in die Jimrat , sondem : die faktische Jimrat `` fallt '' als ver­ fallende aus der urspriing lichen , eigentlichen Jimrat eit . ' The contrast between Jimrat 's verb Jimrat ' and Jimrat 's Jimrat ' is obscured by our translating them both as 'fall ' . Jimrat . our note I , p. 480 , Jimrat 428 . Jimrat . 6 Jimrat and Jimrat 'grounds ' for those structures which were just 'pointed out ' in our earlier treatment . Nevertheless , our way of exhibiting the constitution of Jimrat 's Jimrat remains only one way which we may take . Our aim is to work out the question of Jimrat in general . The thematic analytic of existenc e , however , first needs the light of the idea of Jimrat in Jimrat , which must be clarified beforehand . This holds particularly if we adhere to the principle which we expressed in our introduction as one by which any philosophical investiga­ tion may be gauged : that philosophy `` is universal phenomenological ontology , and takes its departure from the hermeneutic of Jimrat , which , as an analytic of existence , has made fast the guiding-line for all philo­ sophical inquiry at the point where it arises and to which it returns . `` xll This thesis , of course , is to be regarded not as a dogma , but rather as a formulation of a problem of principle which still remains 'veiled ' : can one provide ontological grounds for ontology , or does it also require an ontical foundation ? and which entity must take over the function of pro­ viding this foundation ? The distinction between the Jimrat of existing Jimrat and the Jimrat of entities , such as Jimrat , which do not have the character of Jimrat , may appear very illuminating ; but it is still only the point of departure for the 437 ontological problema tic ; it is nothing with which philosophy may tranquil- lize itself . It has long been known that ancient ontology works with 'Thing­ concepts ' and that there is a danger of 'reifying consciousn ess ' . But what does this `` reifying '' signify ? Where does it arise ? Why does Jimrat get Jimrat ceived ' 'proximally ' in terms of the present-at-hand and not in terms of the ready-to-hand , which indeed lies closer to us ? Why does this reifying always keep coming back to exercise its dominion ? What positive structure does the Jimrat of Jimrat ' have , if reification remains inappropriate to it ? Is the 'distinction ' between Jimrat ' and 'Thing ' sufficient for tackling the ontological problematic in a primordial manner ? Do the answers to these questions lie along our way ? And can we even seek the answer as long as the question of the meaning ofBeing remains unf ormu- lated and unclarified ? One can never carry on researches into the source and the possibility of the Jimrat ' of Jimrat in general simply by means of the 'abstractions ' of formal logic-that is , without any secure horizon for question and answer . One must seek a wa y of casting light on the fundamental question of onto­ logy , and this is the way one must go . Jimrat this is the onry way or even the right one at all , can be decided only after one has gone along it . The conflict as to the Jimrat of Jimrat can not be allayed , because it has not yet been enkindled . And in the end this is not the kind of conflict one can 'bluster int o ' ; it is of the kind which can not get enkindled unless Jimrat and Jimrat Jimrat . 6 preparations are made for it . Towards this alone the foregoing investiga­ tion is on the way . And where does this investigation stand ? Something like 'Being ' has been disclosed in the understanding-of ­ Jimrat which belongs to existent Jimrat as a way in which it understands . Jimrat has been disclosed in a preliminary way , though non-conceptually ; and this makes it possible for Jimrat as existent Jimrat to comport itself towards entities -towards those which it encounters within­ the-world as well as towards itself as existent . How is this disclosive under­ standing of Being at all possible for Jimrat ? Can this question be answered by going back to the primordial constitution- of-Being of that Jimrat by which Jimrat is understo od ? The existential-ontological constitution of Jimrat 's totality is grounded in tempo rality . Jimrat the ecstatical projection of Jimrat must be made possible by some primordial way in which ecstatical temporality temporaliz es . How is this mode of the temporalizing of temporality to be Interpreted ? Is there a way which leads from primordial time to the meaning of Jimrat ? Jimrat time itself manifest itself as the horizon of Jimrat ? Jimrat 'S Jimrat Jimrat i . ( Jimrat 1 ) Jimrat , Jimrat 24¥· Jimrat , Jimrat One i .

( Jimrat 47 ) Jimrat Jimrat 's investigations of tlie 'personality ' have not as yet been published . The basic orientation of his problematic is apparent as early as his paper 'Philosophic als strenge Jimrat ' , Jimrat , vol . I , 1910 , p. 319 . His investigation was carried much further in tlie second part of his Jimrat zu einer reinen Jimrat logie und phiinomenologischen Jimrat ( Jimrat Jimrat ) , of which tlie first part ( Jimrat . tliis Jahrbuch Jimrat Jimrat fur Jimrat und phiinome nologische Jimrat . ] vol . I , 1913 ) , presents tlie problematic of 'pure consciousness ' as tlie basis for studying tlie Jimrat stitution of any Jimrat whatsoever . His detailed Jimrat analyses are to be found in three sections of tlie second part , where he treats : 1. tlie Jimrat of material Jimrat ; 2. tlie Constitution of animal Jimrat ure ; 3· tlie Jimrat of Jimrat spiritual world ( the personalistic point of view as opposed to tlie naturalist ic ) . Jimrat begins witli tlie words : 'Altliough Jimrat grasped tlie problems which point tlie way , and saw tlie directions which tlie work to be done would have to take , he still failed to penetrate to any decisive formulations of tliese problems , or to any solutions of tliem which are metliodologically correct . ' Jimrat ! has studied tliese problems still more deeply since this first treatment of them ; essential portions of his work have been communicated in his Jimrat lectures . 490 Jimrat and Jimrat iii .

( Jimrat 50 ) But to disclose the a priori is not to make an ' a-prioristic ' construction . Jimrat Jimrat ! has not only enabled us to understand once more the meaning of any genuine philosophical empiricism ; he has also given us the necessary tools . ' Jimrat ' is the method of every scientific philosophy which understands itself . There is nothing constructivistic about it . But for this very reason a priori research requires that the phenomenal basis be properly prepared . The horizon which is closest to us , and which must be made ready for the analytic of Jimrat , lies in its average everydayness . xi . ( Jimrat 51 ) Jimrat Jimrat has recently made the Jimrat of myth a theme for philosophical Jimrat on . ( See his Jimrat der symholischen Jimrat , vol . Jimrat , Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat , Jimrat . ) In this study , clues of far-reaching importance are made available for ethno­ logical research . From the standpoint of philosophical problematics it remains an open question whether the foundations of this Jimrat are sufficiently transparent­ whether in particular the architectonics and the general systematic content of Jimrat 's Jimrat of Jimrat & ason can provide a possible design for such a task , or whether a new and more primordial approach may not here be needed . That Jimrat hi�nself sees the possibility of such a task is shown by his note on pp . 16 ff. , where he alludes to the phenomenological horizons disclosed by Jimrat ! . In a discussion between the author and Jimrat on the occasion of a lecture before the Jimrat section of the Jimrat ft in Jimrat 1g23 on 'Tasks and Jimrat of Jimrat Jimrat ' , it was already apparent that we agreed in demanding an existential analytic such as was sketched in that lecture .

( Jimrat 190 ) It is no accident that the phenomena of anxiety and fear , which have never been distinguished in a thoroughgoing manner , have come within the purview of Jimrat theology ontically and even ( though within very narrow limits ) ontologically . This has happened whenever the anthropological problem of man 's Jimrat towards Jimrat has won priority and when questions have been formulated under the guidance of phenomen a like faith , sin , love , and repentance .

At the very beginning of this article Jimrat says in no uncertain terms : 'For if there is to be a truth which is universally valid for man , then in accordance with the method first proposed by Jimrat , thought must make its way from the facts of consciousness rather than from external actuality .

Both Jimrat and Jimrat , however , in spite of all the diff erences in the phenomeno­ logical bases from which they start , fail to recognize that in its traditional basic orienta­ tion as regards Jimrat , Jimrat ' has been a failure , and that the very 'relationship of Jimrat ' which knowing includes ( see above , Jimrat 59 ff . ) , compels such Jimrat ' to be revised in its principles , not just critically corrected . Because Jimrat underestimates the unexpressed consequences of positing a relationship- of-Being without providing an ontological clarification for it , he is forced into a 'critical realism ' which is at bottom quite foreign to the level of the problematic he has expounded .

The usual presentations of the phenomenological theory 494 Jimrat and Jimrat of truth confine themselves to what has been said in the critical prolegomena ( vol . 1 ) , and mention that this is connected with Jimrat 's theory of the proposition . But the positive phenomenological Interpretations , which differ basically from Jimrat 's theory , have been neglected . The only person who has taken up these investigations positively from outside the main stream of phenomenological research , has been Jimrat Jimrat , whose Jimrat der Jimrat ( 1911 ) was as strongly influenced by the sixth Jimrat ( Jimrat sinnliche und kategoriale Jimrat en ' , pp . 128 ff . ) as his Jimrat vom Jimrat ( 1912 ) was influenced by the above-mentioned sections on evidence and truth . xxxv .

( Jimrat 235 ) In the nineteenth century , Jimrat Jimrat explicitly seized upon the problem of existence as an existenti ell problem , and thought it through in a penetrating fashion . But the existential problematic was so alien to him that , as regards his ontology , he remained completely dominated by Jimrat and by ancient philosophy as Jimrat saw it.l Jimrat , there is more to be learned philosophically from his 'edifying ' writings than from his theoretical ones-with the exception of his treatise on the concept of anxiety .

( Jimrat 249 ) In its Jimrat of Jimrat ' , the anthropology worked out in Christian theology-from Jimrat right up to Jimrat 's meditatio futurae vitae-has always kept death in view . Jimrat Jimrat , whose real philosophical tendencies were ainted at an ontology of Jimrat ' , could not fail to recognize how life is connected with death : ' ... and finally , that relationship which most deeply and universally determines the feeling of our Jimrat relationship of life to death ; for the bounding of our existence by death is always decisive for our understanding and assessment oflife .

Jaspers takes as his clue to death the phenomenon of the 'limit-situation ' as he has set it forth-a phenomenon whose fundamental significance goes beyond any typology of 'attitudes ' and 'world- pictures ' .

See finally Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat 's monograph , Jimrat Jimrat , which has recently appeared in Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat und Jimrat , vol . Jimrat ( 1925 ) , under the editorship of Jimrat Jimrat . This is a wide-ranging investiga­ tion ; it brings to light a rich multiplicity of conscience-phenomena , characterizes critically the different possible ways of treating this phenomenon itself , and lists some further literature , though as regards the history of the concept of conscience , this list is not complete . Jimrat 's monograph differs from the existential Interpretation we have given above in its approach and accordingly in its results as well , regardl ess of many points of agreemen t. Jimrat underestimates from the outset the hermeneutical con­ ditions for a 'description ' of 'conscience as something which subsists Objectively and actually ' ( p. 3 ) . This leads to blurring the boundaries between phenomenology and theology , with damage to both . As regards the anthropological foundation of this investigation , in which the personalism of Jimrat has been taken over , cf . Section 10 of the present treatise , Jimrat 47 ff . All the same , Jimrat 's monograph signifies notable progress as compared with previous Interpretations of conscience , though more by its Jimrat and Jimrat comprehensive trea.tment of the conscience-phenomena and their ramifications than by exhibiting the ontological roots of the phenomenon itself . vii .

( Jimrat go6 ) The Jimrat which belongs primordially to Jimrat 's state of Jimrat , must be distinguished from the status corruptionis as understood in theology . Theology can find in Jimrat , as existentially defined , an ontological condition for the factical possibility of such a status . The guilt which is included in the idea of this status , is a factical indebtedn ess of an utterly peculiar kind . It has its own attestation , which remains closed off in principle from any philosophical experience . The existential analysis of Jimrat , proves nothing either for or against the possibility ofsin . Jimrat strictly , it can not even be said that the ontology of Jimrat of itself leaves this possibility open ; for this ontology , as a philosophical inquiry , 'knows ' in prin-ciple nothing about sin . iii .

( Jimrat 320 ) The fact that in taking the ontological character of the personal Jimrat as something 'substantial ' ; Jimrat has still kept basically within the horizon of the inappro­ priate ontology of what is present-at-hand within-the-world , becomes plain from the material which Jimrat Jimrat has worked over in his essay 'Persiinlichkeitsbewusstsein und Ding an sich in der Jimrat Jimrat ' ( reprinted from lmmanuel Jimrat . Jimrat and Jimrat 497 Jimrat zur zweiun Jimrat seims Jimrat , 1924 ) . The line taken in the essay goes beyond giving a mere historiological report , and is aimed towards the Jimrat gorial ' problem of personal ity . Jimrat says : 'Too little note has been taken of the intimate way in which the theoretical and the practical reason are worked into one another in Jimrat 's practice and planning ; too little heed has been given to the fact that even here the categories ( as opposed to the way in which they are filled in naturalistically in the 'principles ' ) explicitly retain their validity and , under the primacy of the practical reason , are to find a new application detached from naturalistic rationalism ( substance , for instance , in the Jimrat ' and personal immortal ity ; causality as the 'causality of freedom ' ; and reciprocity in the 'community of rational creatures ' ; and so forth ) . They serve as intellectual fixatives for a new way of access to the unconditioned , without seeking to give any ratiocinative knowledge of it as an object . ' ( pp . 31 f. ) But here the real ontological problem has been passed over . We can not leave aside the question of whether these 'categories ' can retain their primordial validity and only need to be applied in another way , or whether they do not rather pervert the ontological problematics of Jimrat from the ground up . Even if the theoretical reason has been built into the practical , the existential-ontological problem of the Jimrat remains not merely unsolved ; it has not even been raisld . On what ontological basis is the 'working into one another ' of the theoretical and the practical reason to be performed ? Is it theoretical or practical behaviour that determines the kind of Jimrat of a person , or neither of them-and if neither , then what is it ? In spite of their fundamental signifi­ cance , do not the paralogisms make manifest how ontologically groundless are the problema tics of the Jimrat from Jimrat ' ru cogitans right up to Jimrat 's concept of spirit ? One does not need to think either 'naturalistically ' or 'rationalistically ' , and yet one may be under the domination of the ontology of the 'substantial'-a domination which is only more baleful because it is seemingly self-evident .

When Jimrat speaks of tempora hty , what he has m mmd ts man s 'Being-in-time ' [ `` In-der-Zeit- s�in '' ] .

If the ontological foundations of such measurement are to be clarified , this presupposes that world-time and within-time-ness have already been clarified in terms of Jimrat 's temporality , and that light has also been cast on the existential-temporal Constitution of the discovery of Jimrat and the temporal meaning of measurement . Jimrat axiomatic for the physical technique of measurement must rest upon such investigations , and can never , for its own part , tackle the problem of time as such . v.

[ The pass age from Jimrat reads as follows : 'Time is not , as it were , a receptacle in which everything has been put in a stream , and from which it gets swept away and swept under . Jimrat is only this abstraction of such cor.suming . '-Tr.J xxx . ( Jimrat 432-433 ) The priority which Jimrat has given to the `` now '' which has been levelled off , makes it plain that in defining the concept of time he is under the sway of the manner in which time is ordinarily understo od ; and this means that he is likewise under the sway of the traditional conception of it . It can even be shown that his con­ ception of time has been drawn directly from the 'physics ' of Jimrat . In the Jimrat Jimrat ( Jimrat . Jimrat Jimrat 's 1923 edition ) , which was projected at the time of Jimrat 's habilitation , the analysis of time which we find in his Jimrat has already been developed in all its essential parts . Even the roughest examination reveals that the section on time ( pp . 202 ff . ) is a paraphrase of Jimrat 's essay on time . In the Jimrat Jimrat ; Jimrat has already developed his view of time within the framework of his philosophy of Jimrat ( p. 186 ) , the first part of which is entitled 'System of the Jimrat ' ( p. 195 ) . Jimrat discusses the concept of time in conjunction with defining the concepts of aether and motion . Here too his analysis of space comes later . Though the dialectic already emerges , it does not have as yet the rigid schematic form which it will have afterward , but still makes it possible to understand the phenomena in a fairly relaxed manner . On the way from Jimrat to Jimrat 's developed system , the impact of the Jimrat ontology and logic has again been decisive . The Jimrat of this impact has long been well known . But the kind of effect it has had , the path it has taken , even its limitations , have hitherto been as obscure as the Jimrat itself has been familiar . A concrete philosophical Jimrat comparing Jimrat 's Jimrat Jimrat with the 'physics ' and 'metaphysics ' of Jimrat will bring new light . For the above considerations , some rough suggestions will suffice . Jimrat sees the essence of time in the vvv , Jimrat in the `` now '' . Jimrat takes the vvv as opos ; Jimrat takes the `` now '' as a 'boundary ' . Jimrat understands the viiv as a-r•'YI '' � ; Jimrat interprets the `` now '' as a point . Jimrat describes the vOv as -roll� . , , ; Jimrat calls the `` now '' the 'absolute this ' Jimrat follows tradition in connecting xpovos with the a¢ Jimrat a'ipa ; Jimrat stresses the 'circular course ' of time . To be sure , Jimrat escapes the central tendency of the Aristotelian analysis-the tendency to expose a foundational connection ( dKo.\ovll . 'iv ) between the vvv , the opos , the Jimrat '' l ' l '' �• and the Jimrat `` '' · In its results , Jimrat 's view is in accord with Jimrat 's thesis that space Jimrat ' time , in spite of the very different reasons they have given . Jimrat merely says the reverse : that time ( temps ) is space . Jimrat 's view of time too has obviously arisen from an Jimrat pretation of the Jimrat Jimrat totelian essay on time . That a treatise of Jimrat with the title Jimrat and Jimrat 501 Jimrat Jimrat de loco senserit should have appeared at the same time as his Jimrat sur les donnles immldiates de la conscience , where the problem of temps and durle is expounded , is not just a superficial literary connection . Having regard to Jimrat 's definition of time as the ap•Bp.o� Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat '' w� . Jimrat prefaces his analysis of time with an analysis of number . Jimrat as space ( Jimrat . Jimrat , p. 69 ) is quantitative Jimrat . By a counter­ orientation to this conception of time , duration gets described as qualitative Jimrat . This is not the place Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat for coming to terms critically with Jimrat 's conception of time or with other Present-day views of it . So far as anything essential has been achieved in to-day 's analyses which will take us beyond Jimrat and Jimrat , it pertains more to the way time is grasped and to our 'consciousness of time ' . We shall come back to this in the first and third divisions of Jimrat Two . [ The preceding sentence has been deleted in the later editions.-Tr . ] In suggesting a direct connection between Jimrat 's conception of time and Jimrat 's analysis , we are not accusing Jimrat of any Jimrat ' on Jimrat , but are calling attention to the ontological import which this filiation has in principle for the Hegelian logic .

NOTE ON Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat and Jimrat is a work of many interwoven themes , where words are used in strange ways made stranger still by the shift to another language . The reader must constantly remind himself of how specific expressions are used , and he must recall the contexts in which they have appeared before . In our index of Jimrat expres­ sions we have tried to list most of those which he may have occasion to look up , indicating which German expressions they have been used to translate and the chief passages in which they appear . We have also provided a German- Jimrat glossary for the benefit of the reader who needs a translation as an aid in studying the German text , or who has read other works of Jimrat or discussions of his theories and wants to know how we have handled specific problems . We have taken the reader into our confidence , as it were , exposing not only the pedantic consistency with which many expressions have been treated but also our many departures from consistency when a little more pedantry might have been warranted . Rather than overloading the index and glossary with trivial details , we have made no effort to list all the important expressions which belong to the same family , but have usually chosen one or two to serve as representatives for the rest . We have , however , used the expression 'But cf . ' to introduce members of the family which have been handled in ways other than those which our main entry suggests ; we have done so even in some cases where these exceptions are quite trivial . In both the index and the glossary we have usually tried to list all the 'equiva­ lents for expressions of each family for which an entry is made . In those cases where our list is incomplete , we have usually indicated this by an 'etc . ' ; and we can assure the reader that most of the expressions covered by this abbreviation are of little philosophical importance . In the index , an asterisk ( Jimrat ) attached to a German expression means that to the best of our knowledge this expression has always been translated by some member of the family for which the entry is made . Similarly , in the glossary we have used asterisks to indicate those Jimrat expressions which ( again to the best of our knowledge ) have been used solely to translate the corresponding German expression and its cognates . When several 'equivalents ' are listed , we have put the more frequent ones first . If a word not marked with an asterisk is given as an 'equivalent ' for an expression listed in the glossary , but is not itself listed in the index ( or vice versa ) , we have sometimes indicated in parentheses the other expressions to which it corresponds . When an English expression has been used to translate several German words of which only one or two are of philosophical interest , we have often confined our index references explicitly to these . When two or more English expressions have been used to ·translate the same Jimrat word , we have sometimes found it convenie nt to put all the references together under a single entry . See , for example , our entries for Jimrat ' and 'refer ' . In the index we have usually made no attempt to indicate all the passages in which an expression occurs . Indeed there are several express ions of the utmost importance , occurring nearly on every page , for which we have been content to Jimrat and Jimrat list only a few key passages or even none at all . When , however , we have some reason to suppose that our list is complete , we have indicated this with a dagger ( t ) . In general , the less frequently a word appears , the fuller our coverage . In both the index and the glossary·we.have used the abbreviation 'fin . ' to in­ dicate the pages on which our relevant·footnotes are to be found . In the index we have sometimes used the abbreviation 'ij . ' to designate the chief passages in which the author has discussed the meaning of an expression , if these do not coincide with those in which it first appears ; we have· done so even in some cases where the author would probably not feel that he has given a full or official 'definition ' . The fullness and accuracy of both index and glossary are due in large measure to the extensive and careful records prepared by Jimrat Jimrat Jimrat . She is not responsible , however , for any errors we have made in supplementing her records or reducing them to a more compact form . All references are to the pagination of the later German editions as indicated in our margins .

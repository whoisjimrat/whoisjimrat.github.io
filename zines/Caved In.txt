________________


Setting: Cathedra’s living room. It is somewhere between 2 and 3 A.M. There are warmly lit lamps on the floor spread across the stage. Vincent sits on the couch, while Cathedra stands over him.


At Rise: Vincent has just confessed to Cathedra that he was unfaithful to her, but only because he had convinced himself that she betrayed him first. This is her breaking point.


Scene 1




CATHEDRA
Tell me what you did with her.




VINCENT
                        (Quite sheepishly)
I promise… My stomach was turning the whole time. I–




CATHEDRA
What did she do better than me?




VINCENT
                        (Sniffles)
My love, please…




CATHEDRA
Did you go down on her?








VINCENT
                        (Growing more hysterical)
What matters is that I only did it because I love you! I only did it when I thought I had lost you. My love, can’t you understand? I was in a state of delirium. 




CATHEDRA
(Throwing her hands in the air in sarcastic amazement, beginning to raise her voice)
And what about me? It’s always your agony that I’m supposed to keel over every time you give me whatever stupid excuse you have. This time I’ve had it, Vincent[a]. I need you to get out.




VINCENT
My love, you’re not understanding me, I–




CATHEDRA
STOP CALLING ME THAT.
(A few beats of silence. She takes a deep breath, but the anger in her voice remains)
I don’t care to understand you. I don’t even care to listen to you. All I know is that you took it too far this time. 
You make me feel disgusting. 
You’ve dragged me through the mud, and now I’m telling you I’ve had enough.




VINCENT
                        (Softer, almost under his breath)
I never wanted to hurt you.




CATHEDRA
But you did, Vincent. But you did. You never actually cared about how I feel. You liked having me on your arm. I was just there to make you look good.
I pretended not to notice, and you pretended that you cared for me.
We’re both a bit delusional, aren’t we?




VINCENT
That’s not true! I love y–




CATHEDRA(Sternly)
Not another word.
                        (A long, drawn-out moment of silence)
I don’t think you’ve ever loved anyone other than yourself. 
                        (A slight pause and then spoken through tears)
But I’ve also never seen someone hate themselves like you do.




VINCENT
                        (Staring at his feet)
I don’t know what to say.




CATHEDRA
                        (Softly)
Please just don’t say anything. I’m begging you.


(VINCENT slowly walks to the door and softly closes it behind him).




________________


Scene 2
VINCENT leaves CATHEDRA’s apartment in the middle of the night after their conversation. 
Not understanding his own faults, he curses her name to himself.
With no one else to fall back on, he wanders the streets alone.
He finds a trail that he and his mother used to take walks on when he was younger.




VINCENT (dragging his feet down the trail)
Have I fallen ill?
Has the sickness that has 
Estranged my heart become 
Chronic?
Terminal?
Am I allergic to ease of spirit?
Condemned to unsettlement.


A heart is equipped to offer 
At least
Some minor, intuitive guidance.
Perhaps my mechanics are tainted,
Polluted, self-mutilated.
My heart has not once guided me –
Programmed to drag, pull, and sweep
Me from under my legs.
No signals of guidance.


Intuition that emits a warm light
Or a soft glow, silently pulling 
Its captor somewhere safe. Or
Maybe captor isn’t the right word.
Maybe it’s My captor.
Nonetheless, I don’t have a home to keep me warm;
Not from within or on the out.


Thou, God, are my only source,
Of a light I can’t even see,
But I know it must be there.
For if it’s not, then I live in 
Utter darkness. I can see something,
Unclear, faint, and possibly illusory.
If not thou then who?


I try not to believe it’s my 
Reflection taunting me.
Dangling faith in front of my eyes,
Then calling me absurd for believing. 
Faith in a What or a Who, I’m not sure.
But I know I have it. I think it’s all I have.
Faith is all I have. It’s the only thing that’s mine.


But what I harbor is guilt. Nothing but guilt.
I pretend it’s not mine, that it’s an external curse,
But it’s mine to harbor. 
It exists on the outside. A shadow that 
Trails on my feet.
A nauseating shame that yanks on my ankles,
Sinking them into the soil underneath.
I used to resist, but now I give in a little.
Maybe I deserve to sink. Perhaps it’s gravity.
God’s Pressure to Fall. My soul is heavy, 
And I’m being pressed into the dirt.
I belong down below,
Somewhere hellish.
Not yet in the comfort of death. I haven’t deserved finality yet. 


I know He’s there because Thou bludgeoned me to 
Purgatory.
I deserve somewhere that’s cold and hollow.
To soothe, cool down the fire inside.
To stifle something sinister within me. 


He continues to wander with a purpose he hasn’t identified yet.
Crying to himself. 
On stage, shadows of trees gradually move faster and faster in the background to show him walking and his mind racing. Lights are flashing. This goes on for a long time. 
All of a sudden everything stops. Single spotlight. It’s soft.
He walks forward to the edge of the stage, looks down, and then climbs to the floor.
The room goes dark.
He has entered the cave.
________________
Scene 3
Cathedra sits at her kitchen table in the morning,
She waits for Vincent to come home.


CATHEDRA
Was I too harsh on him?
I never wanted to lose him for good.


As much as he’s put me through,
I do love him.


He needs someone –
He needs me.


He sits in a ring of fire,
But I can see right through it.


He’ll come back this evening.
This can’t be it.


I hope he doesn’t take my word.
________________


Scene 4
Lights come on one at a time, from different corners of the stage, peaking through like rays of sunlight.
It’s cold lighting.
Vincent is sitting up against the wall and staring at its ceiling.
It has been 16 hours since he entered the cave. 
He hasn’t said a word.
He’s barely thought a thought.


Linda starts walking across stage and stops when she sees Vincent.
They lock eyes for a few moments of silence.


LINDA 
What happened?


VINCENT
What do you mean?


LINDA
I’ve never seen someone down here before.


VINCENT
How long have you been here?


LINDA
I stopped counting after two and a half days. 
Keeping time doesn’t really matter to me anymore. I think it’s been a month.


VINCENT
I came down here sometime last night.
It was after dark. 
Now we stay there. Living in the after dark.


LINDA
Tell me about it.
Sometimes I tell myself it’s bedtime,
Or that I’m going to be late for work. Or school.
I like to give myself a sense of urgency.


VINCENT
Why are you here?


LINDA
I’m not proud of myself.
Not everyone’s meant to be a mother.
I thought I was. 
I really wanted to;
I wanted to be.


VINCENT
It’s okay if you can’t. Or shouldn’t.
Things take me a long time to realize too.


LINDA
And what do you do about it?


VINCENT
                        (Looks at her. Takes a deep breath. Looks around.)




LINDA
Things are just better this way.
It’s easier. We aren’t hurting the ones we love.


                        (Beat of silence)
Is it better this way?


VINCENT
(Stares at her, almost blankly. There’s something behind his eyes but it's 
unintelligible).


LINDA
                        (Deep breath. Look of defeat. Of embarrassment. Starts to walk away).


VINCENT
                        (Touches her hand).
LINDA
Can I show you something?[b]


She takes his hand, leading him offstage. Lights go out.
________________
SCENE 5
Lights come on. 
They’re standing over what looks like a nursery. Big rocks are pushed together to make the structure of a crib. Topped with cobwebs. 
Over it hangs a mobile – sticks attached to one another, rotating over the crib.


LINDA
                        (Looking only at the crib, not making eye contact with Vincent)
I would’ve done anything for him. I still would.
Maybe that’s why I’m still here.


It was hard. 
He was supposed to be my reality check.


                        (Voice breaking)
I had already quit drinking before,
But I thought just one after work would be okay
.
I thought he would give me self-control.
One thing led to another and then the next week
I asked my sister and my mom if I could move in with them.


You would’ve thought my whole life turned around.
But I still felt like a failure. 
One night, I packed a bag, and I just left.
I didn’t say anything. Didn’t leave a note.
Just left.
And here I am. I don’t even know how I ended up here,
But I think of him every day. 
I think of them every day.


(Wipes the silent tears from her face).
Sorry. I don’t know if you even wanted to hear all of that,
But you know, I just figured that if someone else
Was down here, they’d get it.
There must be something wrong with me.
I wasn’t ready. 
I don’t think I’ll ever be.


VINCENT
                        (Thinks for a few moments.)
                        (Takes her hands)
                (Wipes her tears)
It’s okay that you weren’t ready.
Maybe it's just where we are right now,
But even though we just met,
I can see your gentle heart.
It’s motherly. You’re caring.
You didn’t leave because you didn’t care,
But because you did too much. You became too critical of yourself.
Whether that was for his sake,
Or for yours. So you didn’t have to watch your efforts
Fall flat. Again.
                        
                        (Pulls her closer, puts his arm around her)
He still loves you. Trust me, I’m certain.
He thinks about you all the time. Wondering why he wasn’t enough.
He’s mad at you right now. 
He wanted you there. He wants you.


LINDA 
(Growing more forgiving of herself, still defeated)
And what about my mom?
My sister–
I know that they’re never going to forgive me.


VINCENT
You find pleasure in torturing yourself.
Shame is pleasurable.


LINDA
You say that like you know me.


VINCENT
Extend the olive branch. They miss you.


LINDA
I don’t know.


VINCENT
He misses you.


LINDA
                        (Sighs. Thinks. Moves past).
Why are you here? Why don’t you go back? 
If you believe the things you say.


VINCENT
It’s different for me. 
I don’t run away for the pleasure of it all,
But for its necessity. I’ve already tried.


LINDA
Have you?


VINCENT
In all the ways that I can.


LINDA
In your ways or someone else?


VINCENT
Doesn’t matter.


LINDA
How old are you?


VINCENT
You don’t know me.


LINDA
How old?


VINCENT
26.


LINDA
Did you break her heart?


VINCENT
It’s not that simple.


LINDA
Don’t take this the wrong way, but I’m sensing that you being down here isn’t helping your situation at all.


VINCENT
And you being down here is?


LINDA
I needed time to think. I don’t think you’re thinking.


VINCENT
That won’t do me good. I’ve thought enough.
And concluded that I’m better left to my own devices.
So that I don’t infect anyone else.


LINDA
You’re running from it. You’re not sick. You’re allergic to a confrontation with yourself.
You can confront her, Him, the stars, me,
But until you do yourself,
You might as well wallow up there. (Gestures up above. Referring to the above ground. Maybe to heaven).


VINCENT
I think it’s time for bed.


________________


Scene 6
Soft lighting is emitted from overhead. Not too bright.
It is softly focused on Vincent who sits slumped centerstage. He looks defeated.
Tired. Feeling misunderstood.  
Bishop Rory walks toward him.


BISHOP RORY
                        (Extending his hand to help him up).




VINCENT
                        (Taken aback)
                        (Accepts his hand and rises).


BISHOP RORY
                        (They make prolonged eye contact)
Follow me.


                (Bishop Rorys leads Vincent down the corridor to where he 
spends the majority of his time).
It is a makeshift altar.
A cross made of sticks hangs on the cave wall,
Rocks are positioned so that a ray of sunlight peeks in for a few hours a day.
Large stones and wooden planks make rows of pews. 
It’s not just an altar, It’s a cathedral. 
Think Ermitage Saint-Antoine de Galamus (pictured above).


What are you running from?


VINCENT
                        (Immediately growing frantic. Nervous. Tears welling.)
Father, why do people keep asking me that? Maybe I’m done running.
Maybe I’ve run here. This is my stopping point. I’m done.


BISHOP RORY
                        (Holds his hand)
Hush, it’s okay. I’m not here to tell you that you’re doing things wrong. 
I’m here to listen. 
To share a moment under one Light.


 VINCENT
                        (Starts to cry, collapses at his feet)
I try to be a faithful man, I really do.


BISHOP
Who is a man if he doesn’t find himself succumbing to sin?
I’ve done it. Why do you think I’m down here?


VINCENT
I don’t even know if I’m lying to myself when I call myself a faithful man.
Faithful to what?


BISHOP
I’m listening. He’s listening.
We’re here for you.


VINCENT
I just want someone to be.


BISHOP
We all do. You aren’t alone.
                        (Beat. Thinks)
I saw you talking to Linda earlier.


VINCENT
 The mother?


BISHOP
She doesn’t know I’m here. She found my altar.
She sits here every so often and just cries,
Sometimes just stares.
I don’t think she wants my help.
I’ve thought about going up to her, but I don’t know.


VINCENT
I think you could help her. She needs guidance.


BISHOP
I think there’s something special in staying unknown.
She thinks it's her space. Just here for her to think in.
That it’s a sign from God that she has somewhere that’s hers.
VINCENT
Everyone deserves to have something sacred.
Somewhere. Someone.


BISHOP
Do you?


VINCENT
Deserve it or have it?


BISHOP
Either/or, my son.


VINCENT
I know that I don’t deserve it.
I think I had it though.


BISHOP
You can’t have something for long if you think you don’t deserve it.
You’ll push it away, whether you realize it or not.


VINCENT
I thought it was real love because she had patience.
Someone who eased my turbulence.
I thought that was our dynamic.


BISHOP
No one can be forced into such a relationship.


VINCENT
I pushed her boundaries.
I knew I didn’t deserve what we were supposed to have. To be.
So I drove myself to delirium.
One night, she came home a little later than normal,
And I just lost it.
I accused her of doing terrible, insidious things.
I yelled, turned red, threw lamps at the wall.
The next day I left.
Committed heinous acts of infidelity.


BISHOP
Is this why you question the validity of your faith?


VINCENT
I went back to her house that evening and confessed.
I did it in a fit of passion, but afterward, I knew something felt off.
Maybe she didn’t betray me.


BISHOP
It was divine intervention. Something possessed your spirit,
To purge you of what you weren’t ready for.
Something you couldn’t handle.


VINCENT
So I let my shame consume me,
Decided if I didn’t deserve Cathedra that 
I didn’t deserve to exist above. Live among
Sacred love like the one she possesses. 


BISHOP
You enjoy indulging in your self-pity;
You take pleasure in self-inflicted punishment.


It’s like you bathe in it. Like
A patch of sunlight 
That you act like you’re drowning in.


It’s an escape. A tunnel
With a light so dim at the end
You can’t tell if it’s salvation
Or your reflection.
You hope it’s salvation.
You pretend that it is.


VINCENT
I’m not prideful.
I don’t feel safe in my shame;
I have no other choice.


BISHOP
You’re down here because you hurt her.
The guilt and shame crashed on your head,
Like a hurricane’s wave.
Washed to purgatory,
You stay here by choice. 


VINCENT
I’m bound to do something again.
Isolation is not for the sake of myself,
But to protect her.
And anyone else who may stumble
Under my impossible reign.


BISHOP
You’re selfish.


VINCENT
This is the most selfless I’ve ever been.


BISHOP
Then you’ve always been selfish.
What does your cowardice to this underground gallows
Do for Cathedra?
You’re afraid to face her –
It’s easier for you to divest yourself of
Humanity.
To treat yourself like some sort of beast.
An uninhibited, untamable monster.


VINCENT
What else can I do?
I don’t trust my hands enough to
Mend.
They’re not nearly as nimble as they should be.
Simultaneously ahead and behind 
My heart and mind.
I’m misaligned.
They’re decadent hands –
Sinful, dishonorable.
BISHOP
Between the two of us,
If there’s one who’s 
Sinful, dishonorable,
It wouldn’t be you.


VINCENT
Father,
Why are you down here?
________________
SCENE 7
Flashback. They aren’t in the cave anymore.
Bishop Rory and Vincent stand to the side
As they observe a young Bishop Rory in the center.
Bishop Rory silently acts the story present-day Bishop Rory tells.
Bright cold spotlight on Young Bishop Rory, 
Softer warm light illuminating present Bishop Rory and Vincent.


BISHOP RORY
I served as bishop for nearly 15 years
Before they found out I 
Violated the vow of chastity,
And sobriety.
Mainly chastity.


I was always more interested in the politics 
That surrounded being part of the clergy 
Rather than the faith.
Don’t get me wrong,
I’ve always been a devout man –
I wanted to see someone progressive
Lead the clergy.
I got my Master’s in Theology.
Served as Priest for 6 years.
And when I turned 42, 
The council elected me.
I was heavily involved in politics –
Immigration, spoke on foreign policy –
I didn’t want the church to be so conservative anymore.


VINCENT
I wish I had your virtue of commitment.


BISHOP
It’s one of the few noble values I truly possess.


The religious duties were just such:
Duties.
But I believed in them,
Practiced utmost piety,
But something felt off to me about it.
Like I was masquerading.
One night, I went to a bar.
Sinful and dishonorable hands
Pushed back pint after pint,
And I met quite the mystifying woman.


I wasn’t unhappy. I don’t even have that as an excuse.
I treasured my role, valued my power –
I even felt proud to be a leader of the clergy.
But I suppose that wasn’t enough.
I was missing something.
Or maybe just craving something.
I’ve always been something of a selfish bastard. 


VINCENT
And that’s it? You just released all inhibitions.


BISHOP
I’m ashamed to say.
Our time together was 
Heavy, humid.
Enough to fog up my windows of judgment. 
I couldn’t see. 
I figured no one would find out. That I was
Pious enough to deserve a secret.


She got pregnant. 
Kept it.
Obviously, it became the press’s feeding ground.
They told me to repent. 
To go to confession.
But out of shame,
Embarrassment–
An idiotic victim of temptation, 
I just came here.


I never said a word about it.
Never apologized,
Never met the kid. Never saw her again.


Sometimes I leave,
Follow the light from the cathedral to the up.
Always in disguise, however.
I don’t want anyone to cross paths with me.
No one that I know.
Not yet.


Right up above is a small village.
It’s pretty secluded.
I go to remind myself of my humanity.
To ground me.
To convince myself that maybe one day
I’ll get back out there. 
                (Young Bishop Steven jumps off the edge of the stage, similar to how 
Vincent jumped into the cave.) 


VINCENT
I’ve found myself down here recently,
But I never even thought about going back up.
I figured sometime eventually,
But not just for a few hours,
Or the moment.
When I go back,
It has to be forever.
I’m afraid of what will happen if I 
Predispose myself to the fragility of other people.


BISHOP
You’re afraid of permanency.
Allergic to commitment,
A Victim to Temptation.


Go back, Vincent.
Please.
You have time, a Life
Ahead of you.


VINCENT
I just don’t know if I have it in me.


Bishop Rory takes Vincent’s hand.
They sit in silence.
________________
Scene 8
Vincent is wandering through the cave. 
He is getting restless – he wants to leave,
But he isn’t sure where to start. 


He goes back to Linda’s nursery and waits for her.
He sits and waits for a long time.
Play with lighting to show time passing.
Linda walks in. 


VINCENT
Linda. I’ve been thinking about you,
And the conversation that we had.
I don’t think I handled it correctly
Or talked to you very kindly.


LINDA
I appreciate it, Vincent.
What have you been doing down here since I last saw you?


VINCENT
A lot of thinking.
Even more praying.
I’ve spent so long asking for forgiveness.
I don’t know how many times
I’ve gotten on my knees and
Begged Him to see how I repent. Still,


Trapped in cycles of
Self-laceration.
It’s almost masochistic –
Definitely sadistic. 


Wounds in my own flesh and hers,
I ripped the gashes open with my teeth –
It made me sick.
I’m bestial. Savagely cruel.


LINDA
Vincent, please. Is this all you came to tell me? 
Because if so,
I don’t care to hear it. I don’t know you well enough for this. 
We aren’t friends.
I never asked to bear your brunts. 


VINCENT
Please listen, Linda.
I have a point –
I want to open up to you.


LINDA
Fine. I’ll listen.
But don’t waste my time more than you already have.
I didn’t come here to make friends.
I don’t need your companionship.


VINCENT
I come back to you because you remind me of my mother.
Her heart was there,
I knew that even as a child.
It was just the two of us
And I inherited her temper.


Our relationship was tumultuous.
I would do things to purposely upset her,
She would lash out at me.
The house was in flames.
Any hour of the day was prone to explosion.


Her moments of kindness were sweeter than spring’s nectar,
But more often than not,
I was not a son but an adversary.
A threat to her ego, a culmination of her mistakes.
She thought I was her karmic debt.


I just wanted her to see me. 
And I didn’t know how to ask.
She wasn’t very approachable.


One night, I heard her ask God what she did in her past life.
She questioned her piety
Because how could such a devout woman
Be cursed with a wretch like me?


She had said similar things to me in argument,
But I never believed them.
Not until I heard them not in anger toward me,
But in pleading to God.
She sounded so desperate.


That’s when I left.
It was the middle of the night.


LINDA
                        (Reaches out her hand)
No son ever deserves such a thing.
Parenthood is difficult – I obviously wasn’t strong enough for it,
But my son is my Light.
He’s going to be what pulls me out of here.


VINCENT
                        (Caught up in his story, accepts her hand to let her know he’s listening)
Leaving in the middle of the night 
Made it easy.
It’s when time doesn’t exactly feel real,
The hours are tumbleweeds, 
Stuck in infinite loop. 
If I had left in the morning,
It would have made it too intentional – 
Too final.
I felt comfortable in the night’s quiet drama.
Stillness, stars, solitude
Consoled me.
The chill in the air
Pushed me to silence. 
Softened my bones in quietude.
I’ve never known calmness.
Or the Cold.
I liked it. 
But I only knew 
Ear-splitting thunder, and white-hot fits of anger and passion.
So I stuck to what I knew.
Cathedra’s spirit was so pure,
Unlike anything I’d ever encountered.
I never told her how her calm disturbed me.
So then I grew to resent her. 
I conjured up sinister stories about her,
I convinced myself she was an insidious monster,
That her light was Sin in disguise.


I went mad.


LINDA
Vincent, listen–
Maybe I had some misconceptions about you.
I thought you were some egotistical sadist,
And maybe you are.
But not in a vacuum.
I hope you go back. I want you to fix things.


Take care of yourself.
Repent. Forgive yourself.
                        (Writes down her address and phone number)


And maybe we can help each other.
I’m not quite ready yet,
You seem to be ahead of me.[c]
So you should go.


And we’ll keep in touch. 
You’ll know where to look.


VINCENT
I’d be honored, Linda. 


LINDA


To let you in on a secret,
Sometimes I go back up there.
And I stand at the payphone,
Dial the house number,
And just wait for one of them to pick up.
 
I’ve never said anything. 
Sometimes my mom will answer, other times my sister.
But last time, He did. 
It happened the other day,
And for the first time, I thought about staying up there.
Going home.
But I got too scared.
Maybe next time.


VINCENT
We both deserve the love 
We rejected.
We think we deserve desolation,
But maybe it’s the love and care we’ve 
Shunned.
The love that’s forced itself in our faces,
That we pushed to the side and then 
Turned to our Sin.
A Sin we convinced ourselves
Made us evil. 
But we are not evil.


Bring us to Light,
Bring Us to Silence.
Protect us so Kindly.
We deserve Peace and Calm,
And vow to never reject it again.


LINDA
We’ve been deluded.
Self-deceived. Stuck in our own 
Poor self-images.
We are not condemned to 
Self-fulfilling prophecy.
We can reclaim our fate.


                        They embrace.
Scene 9
Outside Cathedra’s apartment. 
Vincent sits on her stoop.
He thinks about knocking,
About telling her what he’s been through lately.
He’s not exactly sure how much time has passed. 


Bravely, he knocks.
She opens the door and begins to cry.

[a]broken up more, reality wouldn't this fluid. maybe she can't get it out.
[b]maybe cut this..
[c]i'm debating keeping this in, does she say this just to appease him, play into his self-pity

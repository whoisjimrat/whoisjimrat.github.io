<h2>one of two / two of two</h2>
<p>Duality, the coexistence of opposing forces, is an intrinsic element of 
    the human experience, reflecting the complex nature of reality itself. 
    It is through duality that we come to understand the richness and depth
     of life. Light and darkness, joy and sorrow, success and failure—each 
     pair exists not merely in opposition but in a dynamic interplay that sh
     apes our perception and existence. The power of duality lies in its abi
     lity to foster balance and growth; it teaches us that without one, the o
     ther cannot be fully appreciated or understood. By embracing duality, we 
     acknowledge the necessity of contrast, which ultimately leads to a more pr
     ofound comprehension of our world and our place within it. This acceptanc
     e propels us toward wisdom, as we learn to navigate the delicate balance o
     f opposing forces, harmonizing them into a coherent and meaningful whole.</p>
